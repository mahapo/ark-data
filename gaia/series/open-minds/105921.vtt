00:00:27.657 --> 00:00:29.240 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Virtually all of us

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.400 align:middle line:10%
know of at least one
resurrection story,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.550 align:middle line:10%
particularly that of Jesus
Christ in the Christian world,

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.650 align:middle line:10%
and some of us know
that the same story has

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.280 align:middle line:10%
been told throughout history
in many different cultures

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:10%
and religious traditions, but
what if the word resurrection

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.930 align:middle line:10%
itself has been misinterpreted?

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Freddy Silva is with us
today to talk about a lost

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:90%
art of resurrection.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY SILVA:
Resurrection indeed.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're going
to put a whole new spin on it

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:90%
for everybody today.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.700 align:middle line:84%
First of all, Freddy, I've
interviewed you a few times.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.189 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous work and research.

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Thank you.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
piqued your curiosity

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:90%
about this particular subject?

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.470 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: I kept coming
across this concept of people

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.230 align:middle line:10%
who had risen from the dead
in two of my early books,

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.773 align:middle line:10%
and I was trying
to figure out what

00:01:08.773 --> 00:01:10.472 align:middle line:10%
I was going to do
for the winter,

00:01:10.472 --> 00:01:12.680 align:middle line:10%
and I kept putting together
these bits of information

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.910 align:middle line:10%
about the Templars, who had this
concept of raising the dead.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.750 align:middle line:84%
I kept reading about these old
accounts of people going back

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:84%
to 2000 BC, initiates
in mystery schools

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.680 align:middle line:84%
who had been risen
from the dead,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.990 align:middle line:84%
and I thought what if
the story that we've

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.280 align:middle line:84%
been told in the
Christian world perhaps

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:84%
wasn't meant to be told
in the way it has been.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And I came across one of
the many banned gospels,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and you have to ask yourself,
why would the gospel be banned?

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was
the Gospel of Philip,

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.630 align:middle line:84%
and it was particularly
banned by the church,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and I thought let me have a read
of this and see where it goes.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.625 align:middle line:84%
And Philip makes a very
important statement

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:51.210 align:middle line:84%
that at the time--
and of course,

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.990 align:middle line:84%
he was very much closer to
the events than we are today--

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.630 align:middle line:84%
and he was saying that
anyone who's actually

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.010 align:middle line:84%
reading the resurrection
as the truth,

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:84%
as an actual event is
confusing a spiritual truth

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.630 align:middle line:84%
with something that
didn't actually happen,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.910 align:middle line:90%
an actual event.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So that got me thinking
that, if people were actually

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.634 align:middle line:84%
mistaking this real event
for a spiritual truth, then

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:15.675 align:middle line:84%
what was the spiritual
truth behind resurrection?

00:02:15.675 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And why did people like
Plato and Pythagoras

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and other luminaries
like that-- why

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.180 align:middle line:84%
did they claim the concept of
living resurrection to being

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle line:84%
the pinnacle of their
spiritual development?

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So clearly there's something
here of great benefit

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:84%
for humanity, and it's
probably the reason

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.890 align:middle line:84%
why the church decided to
sideline this and marginalize

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.279 align:middle line:90%
the concept for 2,000 years.

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:39.570 align:middle line:84%
So I felt there was story
there that was worth telling.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.117 align:middle line:84%
And also just to a second
point of validation

00:02:44.117 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
on what you were just
saying, "The Second Treatise

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.380 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Seth" claimed
that Jesus himself stated

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.500 align:middle line:90%
he did not physically die.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.940 align:middle line:84%
It said, "I did not die in
reality, but in appearance,"

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps you know
the rest of that quote.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.198 align:middle line:84%
"The Treatise of
the Great Seth" is

00:03:00.198 --> 00:03:01.825 align:middle line:84%
one of the many
Gnostic Gospels that

00:03:01.825 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:84%
never made the official
canon of the church.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And again, once you
read this, there's

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.150 align:middle line:84%
a very good reason behind it
because here you have Jesus

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.820 align:middle line:84%
quoted in the first
person, addressing Peter,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:84%
watching his
supposed crucifixion.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.610 align:middle line:90%
And he says I was not crucified.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.950 align:middle line:84%
It was another, not
I, who took my place.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.990 align:middle line:84%
It was Simon, and even the
Gospel of Thomas admits this.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.030 align:middle line:84%
It was Simon of Cyrene
who took Jesus' place,

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.707 align:middle line:84%
and as far as the
seventh century,

00:03:29.707 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
the Koran was upholding
the same concept, as well.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.248 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
the next question.

00:03:33.248 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They were claiming
that the whole idea

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:84%
of the resurrection
and crucifixion

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.660 align:middle line:84%
were actually mistaken
for actual events that

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.940 align:middle line:90%
did not actually take place.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.580 align:middle line:84%
People have misconstrued
a spiritual truth

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:90%
for an actual event.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So they were saying that this
god man, who they called Isa,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.520 align:middle line:84%
which is interesting because in
the Arabic world, Jesus' name

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.950 align:middle line:84%
is actually the name of Isis
in the Egyptian tradition.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Now there's an interesting
idea right there,

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.844 align:middle line:84%
and they said that the
whole concept had been

00:04:01.844 --> 00:04:03.150 align:middle line:90%
turned completely on its head.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And people thought that
they had crucified him,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.780 align:middle line:84%
but they actually
were totally mistaken.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And this undercurrent
actually was very much

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.770 align:middle line:84%
running through all the
Gnostic traditions of the era.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Even the Gnostic
Christians at the time

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:84%
said the same thing--
that the whole concept has

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:90%
been completely misconstrued.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:84%
The concept of the
living resurrection

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.015 align:middle line:90%
is a very old concept.

00:04:23.015 --> 00:04:24.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a very old tradition.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.870 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest level of
initiation to the secret arts,

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.455 align:middle line:84%
and everyone was adamant about
this, except for the church.

00:04:30.455 --> 00:04:31.580 align:middle line:90%
So you have 99% of people--

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's get
down to the church.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.460 align:middle line:90%
OK, Pope Leo X.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, the
biggest gaff in history.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, let's talk
about him-- what he said.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.760 align:middle line:90%
This is an interesting remark.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.930 align:middle line:90%
And when was he?

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.220 align:middle line:90%
He was 16th century.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: He was late-- he
was an interesting fellow.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.657 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the
debauched popes-- I mean,

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:51.740 align:middle line:90%
seriously debauched popes.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:10%
The church had a real
problem with this guy,

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:10%
and one day during one of
his many drinking bouts,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:10%
he actually came out
with this phrase,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:10%
and he said this
fable of Christ has

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:10%
served our company very well.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And you wondered, my god, that's
the biggest gaff in history

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.355 align:middle line:84%
if the pope himself is
saying and admitting--

00:05:10.355 --> 00:05:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he said that
it was highly profitable

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.160 align:middle line:90%
for the church.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's put that
whole concept together

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:84%
because that's what's
playing out today.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.545 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the reasons
why so much of controversy

00:05:21.545 --> 00:05:24.920 align:middle line:84%
is behind, for example,
the outlawing of the Masons

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.030 align:middle line:84%
or the Templars within
the Catholic tradition.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:84%
What is it that frightened
the Catholic church so much

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.110 align:middle line:90%
about these organizations?

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they were very
powerful, but the church

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.640 align:middle line:90%
was even more powerful.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.280 align:middle line:90%
They had more resources.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.120 align:middle line:90%
They had more money.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.602 align:middle line:90%
They had more people at arms.

00:05:39.602 --> 00:05:41.310 align:middle line:84%
They could easily have
wiped these people

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.637 align:middle line:84%
off the face of the Earth,
and they nearly did.

00:05:43.637 --> 00:05:45.220 align:middle line:84%
So clearly they were
hiding something.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.386 align:middle line:84%
These people were holding
a secret that really would

00:05:47.386 --> 00:05:49.630 align:middle line:84%
have pulled the carpet
from under the very ethos

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.760 align:middle line:84%
of the church, and the whole
concept that I discovered

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.450 align:middle line:84%
was that the Freemasons
and their forefathers,

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.350 align:middle line:84%
which were the Templars
and their forefathers,

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.160 align:middle line:84%
which were the Essenes, all
follow the same tradition

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.270 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality-- that the
whole basis for the church

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.450 align:middle line:90%
was founded on a huge lie.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why did they
continue to perpetuate it?

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Why did he state it was highly
profitable for the church

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:84%
to keep the current,
let's call it,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.719 align:middle line:84%
resurrection myth
of Jesus alive?

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, because the whole
concept of living resurrection

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:84%
was about a theme of
self-empowerment-- people

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.700 align:middle line:84%
having a direct
experience of God,

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.300 align:middle line:90%
an inner experience of God.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.444 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Church comes along
and says now we are basically

00:06:33.444 --> 00:06:34.860 align:middle line:84%
going to become
the intermediaries

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.680 align:middle line:90%
between the people and God.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
access God, you'll

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.710 align:middle line:84%
have to either pay us or
tell us your problems,

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:84%
and we'll intercede
on your behalf.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.570 align:middle line:84%
It's quite clearly
a situation where

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.356 align:middle line:84%
people have usurped
an actual faith,

00:06:47.356 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
and that was claimed by
the early Christians, which

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.980 align:middle line:90%
is why they were put down.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And so if it could be shown
that the church's foundation was

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.840 align:middle line:84%
completely false, they
could be put out of a job.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:90%
It really is that simple.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.310 align:middle line:84%
So yes, when he was saying
that they had profited well,

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.780 align:middle line:84%
they had profited very well,
because they're basically

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.570 align:middle line:84%
usurping the status and
the prophecy of a dead man,

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and that status was
actually highly dubious,

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.480 align:middle line:84%
because the whole concept
of ritual resurrection

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.160 align:middle line:84%
was about a high level of
initiation, which allowed

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.900 align:middle line:84%
people to have a direct
experience, an inner experience

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.780 align:middle line:90%
of God.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And it had been going on
for thousands of years,

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.331 align:middle line:84%
and the Egyptians
knew all about this

00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:26.040 align:middle line:84%
as well, so if it could
be shown that any person--

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:84%
if you and I could actually
have this experience,

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.600 align:middle line:84%
then obviously there is no
one that these can control.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.237 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't need
an intermediary.

00:07:33.237 --> 00:07:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.890 align:middle line:90%
No middle man.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about some

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:84%
of the traditions
around the world that

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.350 align:middle line:84%
mirror this same
story of resurrection.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, they go
back thousands of years.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:90%
I was surprised.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
something that would've

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.120 align:middle line:84%
been around the time of
Jesus, maybe a couple hundred

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:84%
years before, but the more
I dug into the whole story,

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.520 align:middle line:84%
the more I began to realize
that this concept of living

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.920 align:middle line:84%
resurrection goes
back a long, long way.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.570 align:middle line:10%
For example, there
was a chamber that

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.220 align:middle line:10%
was found-- it was a secret
chamber underneath the Pyramid

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.190 align:middle line:10%
of Unas in Egypt at a
place called Saqqara, which

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.270 align:middle line:10%
is a huge ceremonial
complex dedicated solely

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.170 align:middle line:10%
to resurrection principles.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And inside this
beautiful chamber,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.190 align:middle line:84%
you will find written on
the walls the pyramid texts,

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.410 align:middle line:84%
and the pyramid texts
describe very clearly

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:22.690 align:middle line:84%
that this place of
internment is not actually

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:23.625 align:middle line:90%
for a dead pharaoh.

00:08:23.625 --> 00:08:27.160 align:middle line:84%
It's for a person who's gone
in there to have an initiation

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.660 align:middle line:84%
experience, and the
person, the pharaoh,

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.970 align:middle line:84%
is very much expected to come
back into his living body

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.559 align:middle line:84%
after he's gone into
the other world.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And on the walls of
the actual temple

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.100 align:middle line:84%
it says that the spirits
welcome the soul of Unas,

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.330 align:middle line:84%
who was a pharaoh,
and it says, Unas,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.010 align:middle line:90%
you have not departed dead.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:84%
You have departed
alive to rest and sit

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:90%
on the throne of Osiris.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So what they're trying to tell
us here is that in 2500 BC,

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:84%
this pharaoh had left his
body in a very prescribed way.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.530 align:middle line:84%
He had crossed into
the other world,

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.640 align:middle line:84%
and he was now
sitting and following

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.490 align:middle line:84%
in the footsteps of the
Egyptian god of resurrection,

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Osiris, who, on the
winter solstice,

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:11.660 align:middle line:84%
on the 21st of December,
goes into the underworld.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.620 align:middle line:84%
He had his body broken
up in many pieces,

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.620 align:middle line:84%
and then he is reconstituted,
and he comes back resurrected

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:90%
on the 25th of December.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.390 align:middle line:90%
Does that sounds familiar?

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Exactly,
and that's where

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:23.865 align:middle line:84%
the problems with
the Jesus story

00:09:23.865 --> 00:09:26.230 align:middle line:84%
come into being as far
as we've been told,

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:84%
but then you start looking
around and finding out who else

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.020 align:middle line:90%
had access to this information.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.080 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese also were doing
exactly the same concept,

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.720 align:middle line:84%
because if you take
the word-- in fact,

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.450 align:middle line:84%
the name Jesus is
not a real name.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:38.530 align:middle line:90%
It's a title.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Jesus Christ goes back
to a word called "gesar,"

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.440 align:middle line:84%
and gesar is
essentially a concept

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.440 align:middle line:84%
which is a secret ritual or
a secret piece of knowledge.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's what Jesus
was basically doing.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.130 align:middle line:84%
He was working with
secret information,

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and that concept was
eventually awarded as a title

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.640 align:middle line:84%
to people, real men,
who had resurrected

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.460 align:middle line:84%
as gods because they had
crossed into the other world,

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.925 align:middle line:90%
usually on the winter solstice.

00:10:03.925 --> 00:10:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Three days later,
they are resurrected.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.950 align:middle line:84%
They come back
totally refreshed.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:84%
They are now declared
god men, and the title

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.790 align:middle line:84%
that they were
given was a Gesar.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:17.210 align:middle line:84%
So you have a man called Gesar
Khan in Mongolia in 2000 BC,

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and this term eventually
moves all the way into Europe

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.580 align:middle line:84%
to the point where,
by the Roman era,

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.030 align:middle line:90%
you have people called Caesar.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So this title
continues to be given

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.430 align:middle line:84%
to people who have actually
experienced this resurrection

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:84%
concept, this concept of living
resurrection as a highest

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.920 align:middle line:90%
level of initiation.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.037 align:middle line:84%
They are declared risen
because they are now

00:10:37.037 --> 00:10:39.120 align:middle line:84%
able to see the world
through very different eyes.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.395 align:middle line:84%
They have a total control
of their physical world.

00:10:41.395 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Their frequencies
have shifted greatly

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.440 align:middle line:84%
as a result of
going through this.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.148 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Totally.

00:10:45.148 --> 00:10:45.710 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And the concept of
people who were declared

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.610 align:middle line:84%
risen as opposed to normal
people who were declared dead

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.220 align:middle line:84%
is shown in the
Egyptian pyramids

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.811 align:middle line:90%
as far back as 2500 BC.

00:10:55.811 --> 00:10:57.310 align:middle line:84%
So even back then,
they were already

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.660 align:middle line:84%
talking about two different
levels of people in society.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And going
back to Osiris

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.942 align:middle line:84%
and going back to the
sarcophagus and the breaking

00:11:05.942 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:84%
apart and coming
back together-- it

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.440 align:middle line:84%
has been stated
that people who go

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.150 align:middle line:84%
through this process
of going into another--

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:84%
let's call it another field,
another dimensional field

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.490 align:middle line:84%
beyond Earth have the experience
of feeling as though they've

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.320 align:middle line:84%
broken into billions
of particles

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and are reconstituted
on the other side.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was reading
that part of your book,

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.540 align:middle line:84%
my first thought went to that is
that what the Osirin legend is

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.357 align:middle line:90%
actually telling us?

00:11:33.357 --> 00:11:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, myth is a
wonderful carrier.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.930 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they usually tend
to be analogies or allegories

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual truth.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.749 align:middle line:84%
They're containers
of spiritual truths.

00:11:42.749 --> 00:11:45.040 align:middle line:84%
They just don't make much
sense to us in the modern era

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.600 align:middle line:84%
because they're quoted in a
language and a mythology, which

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.220 align:middle line:84%
is so alien to us now because
it was written so long ago,

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.250 align:middle line:84%
but when you look at the
actual story of Osiris

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.890 align:middle line:84%
through the esoteric
eye, and you

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:59.600 align:middle line:84%
look at the way in which this
guy gets banded into a box

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.850 align:middle line:84%
by 72 co-conspirators--
now, why does it

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:06.910 align:middle line:84%
take 72 people to
bundle a guy into a box?

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.540 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't add up.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.320 align:middle line:84%
72, course, being a
very esoteric number

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:84%
to do with a pentagram,
which is a symbol of nature.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.420 align:middle line:90%
That's the first clue.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.490 align:middle line:84%
So he's bundled into a
box, which is basically

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.280 align:middle line:84%
a big sarcophagus, otherwise
known as the King's Chamber

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.410 align:middle line:90%
sarcophagus.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.000 align:middle line:90%
No one's ever found him there.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.770 align:middle line:90%
He's bundled into this box.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.820 align:middle line:84%
He then goes into
the other world,

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.830 align:middle line:84%
and as he's going through
the actual darkness

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.620 align:middle line:84%
of the other world,
he cries out.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.210 align:middle line:84%
He here's this cry
from the divine virgin,

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:40.130 align:middle line:84%
which is his wife, Isis, and
his body starts breaking apart.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:41.617 align:middle line:84%
His soul starts
being broken apart.

00:12:41.617 --> 00:12:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: His field
is breaking apart.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.366 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because he has to
be reconstituted in order

00:12:45.366 --> 00:12:47.660 align:middle line:84%
to become another radio
station, another frequency

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.272 align:middle line:84%
on the dial of where he's going,
because we here on Earth--

00:12:51.272 --> 00:12:52.480 align:middle line:90%
we're of a certain frequency.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.104 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there are shamans
and people who do this on Earth

00:12:55.104 --> 00:12:55.700 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So basically they're
reenacting this great concept

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.150 align:middle line:84%
that was written down for
us that we wouldn't forget,

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and it's the divine virgin who
reconstitutes Osiris, brings it

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:06.990 align:middle line:90%
back together.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.150 align:middle line:84%
He is resurrected
as a palm tree.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.660 align:middle line:90%
That becomes his symbol.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So the story is conveying
a very essential component

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.870 align:middle line:84%
of-- in fact, the
most secret components

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.420 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient mystery
schools and why people

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.850 align:middle line:90%
lost their lives over this.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
because that's not

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.420 align:middle line:84%
an area people
should tread lightly.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, hell no.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They can
lose their lives,

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and I've read about instances
where lives have been lost.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Individuals have
lost their minds.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Great damages occurred
when they attempt this

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.237 align:middle line:84%
without having the proper
understanding of it.

00:13:35.237 --> 00:13:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, totally,
and when I was reading

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.440 align:middle line:84%
some of the extracts that
have survived of initiation,

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.790 align:middle line:84%
it's usually from
the Greek era, which

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.420 align:middle line:84%
is coming a little bit closer
to our historical era--

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:84%
some people like
Plato and Pythagoras,

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.410 align:middle line:84%
people of that ilk--
they would actually

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.982 align:middle line:84%
hint at what took
place, and they

00:13:54.982 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:84%
said that these writings
come from a very, very

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.930 align:middle line:90%
old tradition.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And they very much
said that the people

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.410 align:middle line:84%
who are in charge, the
highest level of initiates

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:84%
who are in charge of
taking care of people going

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:11.040 align:middle line:84%
into the initiation
concept-- they

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.282 align:middle line:84%
had to undergo
certain strict things.

00:14:14.282 --> 00:14:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Preparations.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Huge preparation.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.301 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Over a
long period of time.

00:14:17.301 --> 00:14:19.640 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
shifting frequencies

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.410 align:middle line:84%
to a completely different
dimensional reality

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:23.077 align:middle line:90%
and coming back.

00:14:23.077 --> 00:14:24.035 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Well, totally.

00:14:24.035 --> 00:14:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Reconstituting
back here.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.775 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And if they messed up
on any part of the process--

00:14:27.775 --> 00:14:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're messed up.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.339 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They were made to atone
for years with ritual baptism,

00:14:31.339 --> 00:14:32.755 align:middle line:84%
and in the most
severe cases, they

00:14:32.755 --> 00:14:35.730 align:middle line:84%
were banned for
practicing for life.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.840 align:middle line:84%
That's something we
could do with today.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.430 align:middle line:84%
You mess up one protocol,
and you're barred.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.340 align:middle line:84%
They were very serious, because,
yes, they basically described

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:48.660 align:middle line:84%
the living resurrection
experiences as a voluntary out

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.910 align:middle line:84%
of body experience, a
near death experience,

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.850 align:middle line:84%
which, as you can
imagine, is frightening.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.920 align:middle line:84%
They had to administer
the right unction.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.470 align:middle line:84%
They had to administer the right
drink, which is a narcotic,

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:03.540 align:middle line:84%
to get you relaxed enough to
have an out of body experience,

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.246 align:middle line:90%
but you are totally conscious.

00:15:05.246 --> 00:15:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's the difference
between the living resurrection

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.870 align:middle line:84%
initiation compared
to shamanism.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.190 align:middle line:84%
You are in control,
totally conscious,

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.427 align:middle line:84%
and you come back
with information.

00:15:14.427 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly,
with full knowledge

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.210 align:middle line:84%
of what has occurred
because you've been awake

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.210 align:middle line:90%
during the entire thing.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Exactly, and that's
why they take up to four years.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
that's really rare.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:24.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And Tony Bushby's work-- did
you ever read any of his work?

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.612 align:middle line:84%
"Secrets of the Pyramid"
and some others?

00:15:30.612 --> 00:15:31.570 align:middle line:90%
No one knows who he is.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:32.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a pseudonym.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.750 align:middle line:84%
I have been told by some
he may be a very highly

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.120 align:middle line:90%
placed Anglican priest.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.630 align:middle line:84%
In any event, his
work is interesting,

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and one thing he
talked about was-- I

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.560 align:middle line:84%
remember this one part toward
the end of one of his books

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.230 align:middle line:84%
were talking about three
Portuguese priests who

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:52.790 align:middle line:84%
had attempted this, who had gone
through this ritualized process

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.940 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking about,
the living resurrection.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.450 align:middle line:90%
One of them died.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.180 align:middle line:90%
One of them came back mad.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.400 align:middle line:84%
He literally lost his
bearings, and then

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:84%
there was one of them that
did make it back through

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.150 align:middle line:84%
to talk about it,
and he explained

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.650 align:middle line:84%
some of that in the book,
but this is something--

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:09.930 align:middle line:84%
because we're not understanding
that this is related

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:14.970 align:middle line:84%
to the word resurrection, A,
that you wouldn't necessarily

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.120 align:middle line:84%
connect the dots
reading these things.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.390 align:middle line:84%
I would not have thought of
it even years ago reading

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:84%
all of that that we'd be
referring to it as a living

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.444 align:middle line:90%
resurrection.

00:16:23.444 --> 00:16:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And again,
the Gospel of Philip

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.260 align:middle line:84%
is very concise at
describing that.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.970 align:middle line:84%
He says quite clearly
and categorically claims

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:33.470 align:middle line:84%
that one should not wait
until death to experience

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:34.850 align:middle line:90%
living resurrection.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:38.750 align:middle line:84%
One must experience living
resurrection while alive,

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and that's what the pharaohs
were saying, as well.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And these Essenes also were
describing in their texts

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:84%
the concept of raising
the dead, the fact

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.797 align:middle line:84%
that you had to undergo this
ritual for about three years,

00:16:49.797 --> 00:16:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and they would spend
about a year just

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.796 align:middle line:84%
watching you to make sure that
you were responsible enough

00:16:53.796 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:84%
to be given the correct
information, because people go

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.017 align:middle line:84%
in, try to squeeze
good information,

00:16:59.017 --> 00:17:01.600 align:middle line:84%
and they would leave and go and
tell other people who wouldn't

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.680 align:middle line:90%
do good things with them.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.470 align:middle line:84%
So the next three
years would basically

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:84%
be dedicated to you knowing the
protocol for leaving the body

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and coming back, because,
yes, they did-- even Plato

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.220 align:middle line:84%
himself said that the
experience is like a near death

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:84%
experience with a difficult
return and a difficult recovery

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:84%
period, but the benefits
were basically outstripping

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.486 align:middle line:84%
the detrimental values of it
because the vision that you saw

00:17:26.486 --> 00:17:30.939 align:middle line:84%
was incredible, the
information that you received.

00:17:30.939 --> 00:17:32.230 align:middle line:90%
And they never talked about it.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks were even
forbidden from discussing

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.470 align:middle line:84%
this in the streets,
and you'd be

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
arrested if you described
what saw on the other side

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.440 align:middle line:90%
because it was personal.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.280 align:middle line:84%
It was something to help you
live your life fully aware.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.331 align:middle line:84%
Now that's
self-empowerment, and I

00:17:45.331 --> 00:17:46.830 align:middle line:84%
can't think of
anything better to do

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.970 align:middle line:84%
than become a person who is
totally alive in the body.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.560 align:middle line:84%
You are living the
dream fully awake.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.250 align:middle line:84%
You are in control
of everything,

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and that's why this was very
secretly and zealously guarded,

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.560 align:middle line:84%
because you don't want just
everybody to have that.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.720 align:middle line:84%
You want people who
have responsibility,

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and they are reliable, and
they can apply this information

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:06.380 align:middle line:84%
and these natural
laws in a way that

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.570 align:middle line:84%
can be used for the
greater good and also

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.690 align:middle line:90%
for your own ultimate benefit.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So why the
feminine to help him

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.180 align:middle line:84%
through the
reconstitution process?

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.030 align:middle line:90%
Why Isis?

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And then the story
of the virgin birth

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.680 align:middle line:90%
repeatedly throughout history?

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yes, that was
a very interesting piece

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.480 align:middle line:84%
of information, because we've
come to-- in the Western world,

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:84%
we've come to accept god
as being a masculine deity.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the ancient world--
and I see this either

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.610 align:middle line:84%
from Central America,
the American Southwest,

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.755 align:middle line:84%
Asia, the Polynesian
islands-- the creative force

00:18:38.755 --> 00:18:42.740 align:middle line:84%
is all defined as a goddess,
an earth god, a god mother.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And she's come through
history in many guises.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.745 align:middle line:84%
We know her, for example,
as the Virgin Mary

00:18:48.745 --> 00:18:51.610 align:middle line:84%
as she became known
in the Christian era.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:54.970 align:middle line:84%
She was also Astarte in the
Middle Eastern tradition.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:84%
She was Isis, but
always a female deity.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And the theme that
was very common

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:middle line:84%
throughout all the initiation
secrets of the raising

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.040 align:middle line:84%
the dead ceremony was that
the initiates would always

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.490 align:middle line:84%
be sent into a chamber--
a secret chamber,

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.870 align:middle line:84%
usually underground
or a secret cave,

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.650 align:middle line:84%
where the chamber was
called a bridal chamber,

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:17.680 align:middle line:84%
but no physical bride
was ever involved.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered, well, what
kind of bride could this be?

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Because they're so
gung ho on this woman.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.440 align:middle line:90%
They zealously pursue her.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:90%
Who is she?

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Well basically she
is the divine virgin

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.760 align:middle line:84%
that they meet when they
cross the other side.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.680 align:middle line:84%
She is literally
the living entity

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.450 align:middle line:84%
that is behind all
of creative nature.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.360 align:middle line:84%
She basically is a
metaphor, a symbol,

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.590 align:middle line:84%
for how life is
created, and that's

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.340 align:middle line:84%
how the ancients basically
phrased that into a shape

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:84%
that we can actually
identify with.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.130 align:middle line:84%
So when you actually go
into a bridal chamber,

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.607 align:middle line:84%
you have to enter as a
single man or a single woman.

00:19:50.607 --> 00:19:52.190 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
have to be totally

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.952 align:middle line:90%
harmonized within yourself.

00:19:53.952 --> 00:19:56.035 align:middle line:84%
The masculine and feminine
are in perfect balance,

00:19:56.035 --> 00:19:58.080 align:middle line:84%
and when you go
into the chamber,

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.960 align:middle line:84%
you cross into the
other side of reality,

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and you basically match
yourself with a divine feminine.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you as a
physical person and as a soul

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.220 align:middle line:84%
are matched with the core
of everything that exists.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:84%
You become one
indivisible person, being,

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.060 align:middle line:84%
and then when you've done
that, when you return back

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.150 align:middle line:84%
into living body, you are now
totally cognizant of the laws

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.310 align:middle line:90%
of paradise.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:21.900 align:middle line:84%
You know the laws
of nature and you

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.340 align:middle line:84%
know how to also work those
laws so you can basically

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:30.570 align:middle line:84%
have a certain amount of control
over the process of creation

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.040 align:middle line:90%
when you're here on Earth.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.564 align:middle line:84%
So you become wedded
to the divine virgin,

00:20:35.564 --> 00:20:37.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's beautiful and
romantic, but it's also

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.770 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful way of portraying
how nature actually works and

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
to Mary Magdalene

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.400 align:middle line:84%
then in attendance when
Jesus has resurrected

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:51.150 align:middle line:84%
or reconstituted himself, and so
this plays out again and again.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And tell us about what
your research discovered

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:58.810 align:middle line:84%
as to the nature of the kind of
mystic Jesus was at that time.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.794 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, he was
a very important man.

00:21:00.794 --> 00:21:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Although if you read it
from the point of view

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.900 align:middle line:84%
of, say, the Templars,
they actually

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.400 align:middle line:84%
regarded John the Baptist as
being even more substantial.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to ask
yourself let's find out

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.130 align:middle line:90%
more about John the Baptist.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And yes, John the
Baptist was a guy

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.180 align:middle line:84%
who learned a lot of
the mystery secrets

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.620 align:middle line:90%
from the Egyptian schools.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.610 align:middle line:84%
He travels back to
the Middle East,

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.560 align:middle line:84%
and he asks all his followers
to prepare for the way.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way is a very old
ritual of resurrection that

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.180 align:middle line:90%
goes back all the way to China.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.250 align:middle line:90%
We know it as the Tao.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:90%
That's where the way comes from.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.760 align:middle line:84%
So for them, for these people
in the Middle East, they said,

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.120 align:middle line:90%
well, this is nothing new.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.070 align:middle line:84%
We knew about this
thousands of years ago.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.690 align:middle line:84%
We've just been prohibited from
practicing this by the rabbis

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:39.320 align:middle line:90%
and by the Romans.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.611 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well that's what
I was going to ask you next.

00:21:41.611 --> 00:21:42.900 align:middle line:90%
This was outlawed.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yes, and so when Jesus
becomes a disciple of John

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.540 align:middle line:84%
the Baptist, and he takes
on the concept of the living

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.160 align:middle line:84%
resurrection, and he too becomes
an initiate of the highest

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:52.930 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Now we know this because
Jesus of Nazareth is the clue,

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.060 align:middle line:84%
and Jesus of Nazareth
is a terrible misnomer,

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.590 align:middle line:84%
because first of
all, Nazareth has

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.390 align:middle line:84%
been proved to actually not have
existed at the time of Jesus.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.600 align:middle line:84%
It was nothing more
than a bunch of hovels

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.430 align:middle line:84%
and a few caves that hadn't
been used for a long time.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:11.430 align:middle line:90%
So where did this come from?

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, Nazareth didn't really
exist, but the term Nazari did

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, Nazari was
the highest level

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.990 align:middle line:84%
of initiate in the Babylonian
tradition of raising the dead,

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and these were the
Magi who were actually

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:30.130 align:middle line:84%
allowed to carry out the most
secret of all the resurrection

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:33.260 align:middle line:84%
principles, which was the
access into the bridal chamber.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Now Jesus obviously
became a Nazari.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.720 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
connection comes in,

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.790 align:middle line:84%
and then he basically
developed his own theories

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:42.400 align:middle line:90%
as to how things should be done.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, the people
that he was working with,

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.676 align:middle line:84%
the Essenes and the Mandaeans
got very angry with him,

00:22:47.676 --> 00:22:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and they're still angry
with him to this day.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:50.133 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:22:50.133 --> 00:22:52.778 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because the Mandaeans
still exist in southern Iraq

00:22:52.778 --> 00:22:53.714 align:middle line:90%
to this day.

00:22:53.714 --> 00:22:55.672 align:middle line:90%
They're called the Nazari.

00:22:55.672 --> 00:22:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And they were angry
with him because they

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.720 align:middle line:84%
said that Jesus actually
was in a bit of a hurry,

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:00.920 align:middle line:90%
too much of a hurry.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.880 align:middle line:84%
He was indoctrinating people
into the cult of the Nazari

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.870 align:middle line:84%
at a faster rate than should
have been legally allowed,

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.190 align:middle line:84%
because they said,
you can't just

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:13.004 align:middle line:84%
allow these things to
be done short term.

00:23:13.004 --> 00:23:14.420 align:middle line:84%
You have to allow
for these things

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.260 align:middle line:90%
to take their proper course.

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus was going up preaching
the most sacred of rituals

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.360 align:middle line:84%
to ordinary people and
indoctrinating them

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.130 align:middle line:84%
into the cult of the Nazari
left, right, and center

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.310 align:middle line:84%
as though he was
running out of time, as

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.430 align:middle line:84%
though he wanted a
certain revolution, which

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.590 align:middle line:90%
appears that he did.

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And given the time
that the Romans were

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:36.470 align:middle line:84%
in a certain degree in
control of the Middle East,

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:40.300 align:middle line:84%
he appears to have
been trying to speed up

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.320 align:middle line:84%
the process of revolution
and getting people awakened.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So the Mandaeans and
the Essenes said, well,

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:51.870 align:middle line:84%
we can't actually allow this
guy to do this as a shorthand.

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:54.396 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has to go through
the checks and balances,

00:23:54.396 --> 00:23:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and they basically said,
no, we don't want anything

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.010 align:middle line:84%
to do with him anymore, which is
kind of funny when you put this

00:23:59.010 --> 00:23:59.610 align:middle line:90%
into context.

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:00.630 align:middle line:90%
They didn't dislike him.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:03.800 align:middle line:84%
They just said that he's not
following the right protocol.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus is basically
is indoctrinating

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.380 align:middle line:84%
people left, right, and center
in order to get people awakened

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.259 align:middle line:90%
at a faster rate.

00:24:10.259 --> 00:24:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was John
the Baptist doing roughly

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:13.307 align:middle line:90%
at that time, as well?

00:24:13.307 --> 00:24:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Same thing.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Same thing.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: He was
carrying on his business

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.744 align:middle line:84%
over in Bethesda, and one of the
people that was under his care

00:24:18.744 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle line:84%
was, of course, a woman
called the Magdala,

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.290 align:middle line:84%
or the Migdal Eder who was
following the tradition

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:26.420 align:middle line:90%
of the Marian tradition.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.070 align:middle line:84%
So we have a person
called Mary Magdala.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.950 align:middle line:90%
That was not a name.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:31.100 align:middle line:90%
It was a title.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.250 align:middle line:84%
A Migdal Eder was a
watch tower of the flock.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.630 align:middle line:84%
So this woman had reached the
highest level of initiation,

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:39.980 align:middle line:84%
and we knew that Mary
Magdalene had reached it

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.750 align:middle line:84%
because she was able
to afford the very

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:46.909 align:middle line:84%
expensive oil, spikenard,
with which she anointed Jesus.

00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does it matter
that she's usually

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.780 align:middle line:90%
depicted in blue, as well?

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Purity, and it's also the
enlightenment of the third eye.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the color
spectrum has an esoteric quality

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.030 align:middle line:84%
about it, right down
to-- for example,

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:02.640 align:middle line:90%
black, the Black Madonna.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have Black
Madonna's in Europe?

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, because that goes
back to the cult of Isis,

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.100 align:middle line:84%
which is also the cult
of Mary, and black

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.160 align:middle line:84%
is the color associated with
resurrection and wisdom,

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.020 align:middle line:84%
because the ancients always said
that, before there was anything

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.670 align:middle line:84%
in the universe,
there was darkness,

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and wisdom resided
in the darkness.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:19.570 align:middle line:90%
So the black Mary--

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:20.528 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:25:20.528 --> 00:25:22.370 align:middle line:84%
It was given birth
to from the darkness.

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Everything has a logic
to it if you just

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.290 align:middle line:90%
care to follow that logic.

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, so since
we're in the Middle East

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.340 align:middle line:84%
and we're discussing that time,
Temple Mount plays into this.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the Temple Mount.

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:84%
All we hear is
what's in the news.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Who's not allowing whom to
go in or to enter, and war

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:44.897 align:middle line:84%
is being created, and bombings
and so forth-- let's go back.

00:25:44.897 --> 00:25:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, the fighting.

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The copper
scrolls and what

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.389 align:middle line:84%
was happening under the
Temple Mount in the day?

00:25:50.389 --> 00:25:52.305 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They're fighting
over the same thing.

00:25:52.305 --> 00:25:55.030 align:middle line:84%
It's so sad and comical
at the same time

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:57.500 align:middle line:84%
if you don't follow
the consequences.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Back in the day, when
the Essenes were pursuing

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.014 align:middle line:84%
this concept of
living resurrection,

00:26:02.014 --> 00:26:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and they were
administering people

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:07.260 align:middle line:84%
into this rite of initiation
where people were literally

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:10.010 align:middle line:84%
raised from the dead in
underground chambers.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:12.192 align:middle line:84%
The Romans were
advancing in 70 AD,

00:26:12.192 --> 00:26:13.650 align:middle line:84%
and they knew that
the time was up.

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:17.420 align:middle line:10%
So they buried these copper
scrolls at certain locations,

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.030 align:middle line:10%
and the ones that were found
in Qumran by the Dead Sea

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:22.790 align:middle line:10%
quite clearly show that
the Essenes were following

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:26.930 align:middle line:10%
practices, and I quote
"of Egyptian origin

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:31.820 align:middle line:10%
underneath Temple Mount," and in
latter day archaeological digs,

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:34.890 align:middle line:10%
the actual chambers where
the Essenes and even earlier

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:37.420 align:middle line:10%
people, going back all
the way to Solomon,

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.740 align:middle line:10%
had built a specific bridal
chamber, which was only

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.790 align:middle line:10%
used by the highest
level of initiates

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.980 align:middle line:10%
where they could
actually marry the bride.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And again, no physical
bride was ever involved.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So the Essenes, too, were
also playing out this ritual

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.390 align:middle line:84%
on this very potent
site of the Earth,

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:58.460 align:middle line:84%
because like other major sacred
sites on the face of the Earth,

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Temple Mount sits
at the junction

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:02.860 align:middle line:84%
box of these intersecting
lines of the Earth's

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:06.200 align:middle line:84%
toric currents, what you and
I would call energy lines.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.520 align:middle line:90%
So we know they exist.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.990 align:middle line:90%
NASA has proved that they exist.

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Dowsers have proved
that they exist,

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:13.870 align:middle line:84%
and some places just have more
of these lines than others.

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, that helps the process
that you're about to undergo.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.146 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
that a little bit--

00:27:18.146 --> 00:27:21.230 align:middle line:84%
what the energy does to
promote that level of ability

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:22.037 align:middle line:90%
or consciousness.

00:27:22.037 --> 00:27:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, it's
very, very important

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.940 align:middle line:84%
because every single
sacred site on the face

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.430 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth without exception
is placed upon the earth's

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.200 align:middle line:90%
intersecting lines of energy.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So all the junction boxes
of the earth's energy lines

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.870 align:middle line:84%
all appear under the
major sacred sites.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, first of all,
you've got to understand

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.650 align:middle line:84%
that all of these initiations
were done in the dark,

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and also in caves,
or in temples that

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:45.814 align:middle line:90%
were made to look like caves.

00:27:45.814 --> 00:27:48.022 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in underground
chambers in the temples.

00:27:48.022 --> 00:27:49.438 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And
underground chambers.

00:27:49.438 --> 00:27:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And once you put yourself
in that situation,

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.100 align:middle line:90%
one thing happens.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.540 align:middle line:84%
You start developing
the pineal gland,

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and it basically
starts vibrating

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.270 align:middle line:84%
at a different
frequency, and you

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.440 align:middle line:84%
start creating a
chemical called DMT,

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.565 align:middle line:84%
which is a hallucinogen,
which is the first level--

00:28:03.565 --> 00:28:04.689 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Spirit molecule--

00:28:04.689 --> 00:28:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --for you have to
have an out of body experience

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:90%
if you know how to direct it.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's the first level.

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Second level is that,
once you immerse yourself

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:15.510 align:middle line:84%
inside the dark chamber
for a long period of time,

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:17.990 align:middle line:84%
as these people
did, your body clock

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:20.820 align:middle line:84%
starts vibrating to the
rhythm of the lunar calendar,

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.950 align:middle line:84%
not the solar
calendar, which also

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.910 align:middle line:84%
allows you to have
that connection

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:27.860 align:middle line:84%
with the feminine form of
life, with a natural aspect

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:28.860 align:middle line:90%
of nature.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Third level is that
all these energy

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.620 align:middle line:84%
lines are electromagnetic,
and a small shift

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.870 align:middle line:84%
in the local electromagnetic
field at these sites

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.370 align:middle line:84%
is enough to trigger an
out of body experience,

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and correctly guided-- which is
what these priests were doing

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:44.390 align:middle line:84%
for the initiates-- correctly
guided, all of these energies

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.440 align:middle line:84%
would go together along
with a small narcotic, which

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.290 align:middle line:84%
is administered to allow the
initiate to leave the body much

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:50.850 align:middle line:90%
more easily.

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Reduce
some fear, perhaps.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: To reduce the fear.

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:54.663 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like doing a blind date.

00:28:54.663 --> 00:28:57.349 align:middle line:84%
You just have a little drink
and you're fine hopefully.

00:28:57.349 --> 00:28:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A blind date
with their destiny anyway.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And so it allows--
the whole concept

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.540 align:middle line:84%
is what I describe as
a spiritual technology.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was known for
thousands of years,

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.120 align:middle line:84%
and that's how they
basically assisted the soul

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.870 align:middle line:84%
to leave the body temporarily
and for you to come back

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.320 align:middle line:84%
into the body and lead
a very ordinary life--

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.269 align:middle line:90%
or not so ordinary in this case.

00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
kind of frequencies

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:23.330 align:middle line:84%
must be represented or present
under the Temple Mount?

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:25.070 align:middle line:90%
Because this continues on.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, you said after the
Essenes, this was knocked on,

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.840 align:middle line:84%
passed down knowledge
through time,

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.120 align:middle line:90%
and then came the Templars.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And now we're talking back
to the Temple Mount again.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.570 align:middle line:90%
The center stage.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.227 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yes, why did
nine Belgians-- back then

00:29:42.227 --> 00:29:43.060 align:middle line:90%
there wasn't France.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.050 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't Belgium.

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.200 align:middle line:84%
There weren't any
countries in Europe.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Why did these people
from what became

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Belgium and France suddenly
take a ride 2,000 miles

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:57.140 align:middle line:84%
to Jerusalem, specifically
request this particular spot

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.720 align:middle line:84%
on this big mount from
the King of Jerusalem,

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and the King just
looked at these guys

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:04.270 align:middle line:84%
who looked like a bunch
of itinerant tramps--

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:05.500 align:middle line:90%
they really were.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:06.780 align:middle line:90%
They were very dirty.

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And the King just says, please
have my house of habitation.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.932 align:middle line:90%
They were very specific.

00:30:12.932 --> 00:30:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have to ask yourself
who was behind the Templars.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Now we have here a man of
profound Christian interest.

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the
early Christian interest,

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.081 align:middle line:90%
not what it became.

00:30:23.081 --> 00:30:24.830 align:middle line:10%
This is a guy called
Bernard of Clairvaux,

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.205 align:middle line:10%
the head of the
Cistercian order,

00:30:26.205 --> 00:30:28.050 align:middle line:10%
who's more Christian
than the Christians,

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:31.230 align:middle line:10%
and he knew about the
concept of the Essenes

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:34.010 align:middle line:10%
and other principles that had
been taking place on the Temple

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:36.280 align:middle line:10%
Mount for thousands of
years because he sponsored

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.960 align:middle line:10%
a cabalistic school
in his hometown.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.030 align:middle line:90%
That's the secret.

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:43.810 align:middle line:84%
So he sends these guys over
to Jerusalem to find out,

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:47.770 align:middle line:84%
let's see what the Essenes
found buried under Temple Mount,

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and if you can
find those scrolls,

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.750 align:middle line:84%
bring them back to Europe,
and then we'll build a kingdom

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.810 align:middle line:84%
of conscience in the middle
of this total war zone,--

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:58.020 align:middle line:84%
because it was back then--
and we'll rebuild a kingdom

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:58.880 align:middle line:90%
of conscience.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And for a certain period
of time in the Middle Ages,

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.550 align:middle line:84%
they succeeded,
and they basically

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.170 align:middle line:84%
broke back off-- let's say,
resurrected the concept

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:09.570 align:middle line:84%
of the Essenes and the ancient
Egyptian temple practices

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:12.870 align:middle line:84%
because the Templars too,
in their buildings also

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:15.110 align:middle line:84%
had a secret chamber,
and I found most of them

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:17.850 align:middle line:84%
in the country that they
created from scratch, Portugal,

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:20.770 align:middle line:84%
which of course, the
theme of my previous book.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And again, they were literally
following an Egyptian tradition

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:27.300 align:middle line:84%
or they were following a
tradition that goes all the way

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.745 align:middle line:90%
back to China, because they--

00:31:28.745 --> 00:31:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or even
beyond that, perhaps.

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: And beyond that.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We don't know.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: We just don't know
how old this stuff really is,

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:35.830 align:middle line:84%
but they, too, had
an inner tradition

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:36.990 align:middle line:90%
of an inner brotherhood.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:38.365 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you
place the Essenes

00:31:38.365 --> 00:31:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and the Templars
together side by side,

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.310 align:middle line:84%
they were exactly
the same people.

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:43.030 align:middle line:90%
They wore white.

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:45.970 align:middle line:84%
They gave all their money
away to be held in trusts.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.460 align:middle line:84%
They had a period of initiation
that lasted three years

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.980 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And at the end,
the inner initiates

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:55.890 align:middle line:84%
were put into a bridal chamber
for a certain amount of time

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:58.670 align:middle line:84%
and declared risen after
they came back out of there,

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:00.560 align:middle line:84%
while the people who
followed on from there,

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.940 align:middle line:84%
their progeny, the Freemasons,
still have that concept.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.510 align:middle line:84%
The third degree
of Freemasonry is

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:09.010 align:middle line:84%
a guy or a woman
who is basically

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:13.680 align:middle line:84%
put in a figurative grave and
then brought up by the head

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Mason or Masonette, and they are
declared risen from the dead,

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and their blindfold is removed
because now they can see.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But again, now this is
more metaphorical by this time.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:30.420 align:middle line:84%
At what time did this
process begin degrading

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:34.830 align:middle line:84%
from the original ability
to go through this living

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:38.990 align:middle line:84%
resurrection process to what's
being done in most of the, say,

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.660 align:middle line:90%
Masonic temples today?

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It varies.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:45.019 align:middle line:84%
My understanding
of Masonry-- and I

00:32:45.019 --> 00:32:46.560 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of friends
who are Masons,

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.444 align:middle line:84%
and I keep getting
asked to join.

00:32:48.444 --> 00:32:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I just don't do
it because I don't

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.235 align:middle line:84%
want my work to
be seen as coming

00:32:51.235 --> 00:32:52.560 align:middle line:90%
from a certain point of view.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to maintain a certain
neutrality but having

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:57.300 align:middle line:84%
met a lot of Masons from
different parts of the world

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.860 align:middle line:84%
and also especially the
Scottish Rite Masonry--

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:04.090 align:middle line:84%
I can say quite categorically
that, yes, there

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:07.420 align:middle line:84%
are still Masonic institutions
around the world that are still

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.920 align:middle line:84%
practicing the
original teachings.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And they understand
it, and it's usually

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:15.420 align:middle line:84%
goes back to the Scottish Rite
or the Belgian chapter, as

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.581 align:middle line:90%
well, of the women's lodge.

00:33:16.581 --> 00:33:19.080 align:middle line:84%
They also fall in the original
principles because, you know,

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.621 align:middle line:84%
I am talking about
this information--

00:33:20.621 --> 00:33:21.840 align:middle line:90%
they'll say, oh, absolutely.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.150 align:middle line:84%
We totally understand
where you're coming from.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:27.620 align:middle line:84%
So there are still pockets
of resistance going on

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.380 align:middle line:84%
as there were back
in the original time

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.600 align:middle line:84%
when the Catholics took
control of the whole system.

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.080 align:middle line:84%
There were pockets of resistance
in Italy and in Greece.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.830 align:middle line:84%
The underground
teachings literally

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.056 align:middle line:84%
went very underground,
so you'd have

00:33:40.056 --> 00:33:41.305 align:middle line:90%
to know who these people were.

00:33:41.305 --> 00:33:42.471 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're dangerous.

00:33:42.471 --> 00:33:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It became a heresy.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it would.

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And what would a
typical candidate

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:49.740 align:middle line:84%
be like, for example, that
would in these traditions

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.870 align:middle line:84%
be taken through to,
if you're talking

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:54.160 align:middle line:84%
about modern times, the
third degree of Masonry?

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:57.976 align:middle line:84%
The Cathos have their own
version for which, of course,

00:33:57.976 --> 00:33:59.590 align:middle line:90%
they were persecuted, as well.

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:02.310 align:middle line:84%
The Rosicrucians also had
their own particular version.

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:07.323 align:middle line:84%
They kept regurgitating and
doing a PR story on the-- they

00:34:07.323 --> 00:34:08.489 align:middle line:90%
were doing a different take.

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:10.448 align:middle line:84%
For example, Isaac Newton
was also an initiate.

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:12.488 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I was going
to ask you about that.

00:34:12.488 --> 00:34:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And he declared
that my visions came

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.397 align:middle line:84%
from a certain initiation,
and everything I learned

00:34:17.397 --> 00:34:19.480 align:middle line:84%
was to be learned and
discovered by the Egyptians.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.139 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, oh dear.

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:24.429 align:middle line:84%
This guy obviously crossed
over in a ritual initiation.

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:27.480 align:middle line:84%
I believe he was a Rosicrucian,
and he came back into the body,

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.610 align:middle line:84%
again, with visions, with a
certain understanding of how

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.469 align:middle line:84%
nature works, and
he applied them,

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:35.420 align:middle line:84%
and he's now famous
for a very good reason.

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:39.350 align:middle line:84%
So obviously people were still
be doing these rituals even up

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:40.100 align:middle line:90%
to the modern era.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.558 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
through modern times.

00:34:41.558 --> 00:34:42.579 align:middle line:90%
And up through today?

00:34:42.579 --> 00:34:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: And right up to today.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.453 align:middle line:84%
People still do it
very, very quietly.

00:34:45.453 --> 00:34:46.830 align:middle line:90%
That's French Freemasonry.

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:49.038 align:middle line:84%
There's still a branch of
that where people are still

00:34:49.038 --> 00:34:51.960 align:middle line:84%
pursuing the rite principles,
and if walk around Paris,

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.199 align:middle line:84%
in certain places you
will see that there

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:56.590 align:middle line:84%
are certain monuments even
erected in only the last 10

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.054 align:middle line:84%
years-- and I'll leave
you with a clue, the glass

00:34:59.054 --> 00:34:59.970 align:middle line:90%
pyramid at the Louvre.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, we
know about that one.

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:02.856 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They are
still trying to create

00:35:02.856 --> 00:35:06.090 align:middle line:84%
a kingdom of conscience so that
people-- and this goes back

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:08.270 align:middle line:90%
to the concept of the temple.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:11.470 align:middle line:84%
The temple was seen as
basically the perfect image

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:13.340 align:middle line:84%
of the kingdom of
heaven, and when

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:16.120 align:middle line:84%
the temple is created on
the face of the Earth,

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.730 align:middle line:84%
people vibrate with
that perfection,

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:20.253 align:middle line:84%
and then that perfection
empowers people to be

00:35:20.253 --> 00:35:21.640 align:middle line:90%
perfect within themselves.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.510 align:middle line:84%
So one thing is a
mirror of itself.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:25.960 align:middle line:84%
So in Paris, for many
hundreds of years,

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:29.380 align:middle line:84%
the Masons have tried to
create a city of conscience

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:33.550 align:middle line:84%
in order that those ancient
principles can vibrate along

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:37.600 align:middle line:84%
the land, and people succumb
to those principles or not,

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.090 align:middle line:84%
because it's a free
will, but no one

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:41.570 align:middle line:84%
can deny that when
you go to Paris

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:43.482 align:middle line:84%
there is a certain
feeling of perfection

00:35:43.482 --> 00:35:44.690 align:middle line:90%
there at the center of Paris.

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and where
does Saint-Sulpice come in?

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:48.428 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Saint-Sulpice?

00:35:48.428 --> 00:35:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Oh, now we're
talking conspiracy.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Saint-Sulpice is
very interesting

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:57.020 align:middle line:84%
because it goes back to the time
when a mysterious order called

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.800 align:middle line:84%
the Order of Sion, who
essentially were one of the two

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.480 align:middle line:84%
people who created the Knights
Templar back in their heyday,

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.690 align:middle line:90%
and they are very real.

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Despite what you
hear on television,

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:08.184 align:middle line:90%
there is plenty of evidence.

00:36:08.184 --> 00:36:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Books have been
written about this

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.880 align:middle line:84%
to show that they are
a real organization.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That they still exist.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.074 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they still
exist despite all the efforts

00:36:15.074 --> 00:36:15.740 align:middle line:90%
to the contrary.

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.115 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have
dug up the same.

00:36:17.115 --> 00:36:18.349 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, yes.

00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And enough money has
been spent making sure

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.360 align:middle line:84%
that you don't go
follow the trail,

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.370 align:middle line:84%
but they created a
front at the time.

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And I believe this is
about the 18th century when

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:29.830 align:middle line:84%
modern Freemasonry
starts gaining

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:31.690 align:middle line:90%
another foothold in Europe.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:33.491 align:middle line:84%
They needed a front
to operate, and they

00:36:33.491 --> 00:36:35.490 align:middle line:84%
were given the right
opportunity around the time

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:36.717 align:middle line:90%
the French Revolution.

00:36:36.717 --> 00:36:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So because they didn't want to
go to public because the church

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.730 align:middle line:84%
was still very powerful, they
decided to build Saint-Sulpice

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:44.590 align:middle line:90%
as this beautiful cathedral.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that behind,
literally behind Saint-Sulpice

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:50.459 align:middle line:84%
was the mystical
college that was

00:36:50.459 --> 00:36:52.500 align:middle line:84%
the front of one of the
headquarters of the Order

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.080 align:middle line:84%
of Sion in Paris,
and eventually it

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.140 align:middle line:84%
was Brother Sauniere that came
all the way from the south

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:03.490 align:middle line:84%
of France with scrolls
outlining this lineage of Mary

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Magdalene that had survived at
the time of the crucifixion,

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:09.810 align:middle line:84%
which even the Koran and
the Gospel of Philip and all

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:13.770 align:middle line:84%
the Gnostic Christians said the
crucifixion never took place.

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So these Gnostic
Gospels, they're

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.790 align:middle line:90%
not making this stuff up.

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.277 align:middle line:84%
And this guy, Sauniere,
came up with these scrolls

00:37:20.277 --> 00:37:22.860 align:middle line:84%
that he found in this church in
the south of France that said,

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.580 align:middle line:84%
yes, the lineage
of Mary Magdalene

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:28.410 align:middle line:84%
is alive and well in
France, and the descendants

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:29.390 align:middle line:90%
live to this day.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And he takes these scrolls
to be shown to cryptographers

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:35.630 align:middle line:90%
in Saint-Sulpice.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, what would
a church be doing

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.380 align:middle line:84%
hiding cryptographers
in the center of Paris

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.570 align:middle line:90%
in the 18th century.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's a lovely story.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.900 align:middle line:84%
It's way too complicated
to be made up,

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.040 align:middle line:84%
because it requires
a lot of preparation

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:51.080 align:middle line:84%
to create something like that
that would not make any sense.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:51.995 align:middle line:90%
So this is--

00:37:51.995 --> 00:37:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this
where-- go ahead.

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:53.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It was all part
of basically restoring

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.820 align:middle line:84%
the divine feminine,
and when you

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.890 align:middle line:84%
look at the buildings created
in Paris after that era

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and especially around
the revolution,

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:04.980 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the symbology is
associated with either Isis

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.420 align:middle line:84%
or Mary Magdalene, and it's
still there to this very day.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now if
we go Dan Brown style,

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and we get into the Saint
Clare's and the Merovingians,

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, where does that
come into it, or does it?

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It does.

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Dan Brown did us all a big
favor by fictionalizing

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:24.750 align:middle line:84%
real information,
for which, I believe

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:26.500 align:middle line:84%
the Church spent
$13 million trying

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.860 align:middle line:90%
to debunk a fictional book.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.870 align:middle line:90%
That's very bad PR.

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:33.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like putting a parental
sticker on a punk album.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.290 align:middle line:90%
You know it's going to sell.

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.800 align:middle line:90%
Just leave it alone.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.460 align:middle line:84%
So he did us all a huge
favor by popularizing stuff

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.450 align:middle line:84%
that I and other researchers
had already published,

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:44.665 align:middle line:84%
which is real facts
showing that, yes, there

00:38:44.665 --> 00:38:46.998 align:middle line:84%
is a conspiracy of silence,
because it goes back to what

00:38:46.998 --> 00:38:49.720 align:middle line:84%
I was saying at the
beginning-- that, in fact, what

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.380 align:middle line:84%
the Gnostic gospels were saying
right from the very beginning

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.530 align:middle line:84%
that the church is
an impostor, and even

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Jesus in the Gospel-- I believe
it's the Gospel of Resurrection

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:02.380 align:middle line:84%
or the Gospel of the
Great Seth declares--

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and I quote-- "those who call
themselves priest and bishop

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and deacon are essentially
waterless canals.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Although they boast of
knowing the mystery,

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:12.900 align:middle line:84%
they do not know the
mystery, and they

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:16.330 align:middle line:84%
have diluted and polluted
the original teaching

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:17.147 align:middle line:90%
of the apostles."

00:39:17.147 --> 00:39:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well said.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that's
a quote by Jesus--

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:20.333 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well said.

00:39:20.333 --> 00:39:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --after he
survived the crucifixion,

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:24.116 align:middle line:90%
and that's beautiful.

00:39:24.116 --> 00:39:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
that is beautiful.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:27.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let me just ask you--
this is a bit of an aside,

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:31.770 align:middle line:84%
but after Dan Brown's work
came out and popularized

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:34.180 align:middle line:84%
the notion of some of
what we're talking about,

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:37.880 align:middle line:84%
did that give you a bump
in your own work and sales?

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I had dinner with Laurence
Gardner, the now deceased

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Laurence Gardner, not too
long after Dan Brown's work

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.300 align:middle line:90%
came out.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.415 align:middle line:84%
And he said good
on him, basically.

00:39:48.415 --> 00:39:51.260 align:middle line:90%
He said my work has skyrocketed.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And have the other
researchers, such as yourself,

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:55.645 align:middle line:84%
found that there's been
increased curiosity.

00:39:55.645 --> 00:39:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: If you've got a good
publisher that can actually

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.850 align:middle line:84%
promote this and
actually do this, yes.

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:01.600 align:middle line:90%
In my case, I don't.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just the way
publishing is today.

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:05.060 align:middle line:90%
It's very hard to get published.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even
the last 10 years,

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:07.673 align:middle line:84%
it's totally had the
slats kicked out.

00:40:07.673 --> 00:40:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And with a
certain online company

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:12.480 align:middle line:84%
that is putting everybody out
of business isn't helping.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's bumped it
up a little bit,

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:16.895 align:middle line:84%
but I had noticed that more
people want to go on my tours

00:40:16.895 --> 00:40:18.770 align:middle line:84%
to sacred sites, because
that's essentially--

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:19.885 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To have
the experience.

00:40:19.885 --> 00:40:21.801 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --what the
experience of resurrection

00:40:21.801 --> 00:40:23.660 align:middle line:90%
really is all about.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:26.320 align:middle line:84%
You're getting a glimpse of it
when you go into these places,

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.330 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen a
huge bump in people

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:32.200 align:middle line:84%
wanting to go to these places to
not be going there as tourists,

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.900 align:middle line:84%
but as going as
pilgrims to understand

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.620 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual
context of the land,

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.620 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's important,
because essentially

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:40.030 align:middle line:84%
that's the pathway to
living resurrection.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Once you have an experience, and
people have this on my groups

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:45.550 align:middle line:84%
all the time, and I don't
tell them about this.

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:47.710 align:middle line:84%
I want them to figure
it out for themselves.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:49.810 align:middle line:84%
I just give them the
goal posts, send them

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:51.880 align:middle line:84%
in the right direction,
and people come back

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.220 align:middle line:90%
changed and altered.

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And then they follow
another path into inquiry

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:58.820 align:middle line:84%
and slowly they go
down that rabbit hole,

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.610 align:middle line:84%
and they come out the other
side risen from the dead.

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:03.616 align:middle line:84%
And again, they
are self-empowered.

00:41:03.616 --> 00:41:05.490 align:middle line:84%
They have seen the
mechanics of the universe.

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:07.410 align:middle line:84%
They see things with
a greater clarity

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:09.420 align:middle line:84%
than before, and
when they do that,

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:12.000 align:middle line:84%
just like the ancestors
claimed in these books

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.740 align:middle line:84%
that you are able to live your
life fully aware and awake.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.460 align:middle line:84%
You are in control, and
you are able to perceive

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.690 align:middle line:84%
the tyranny of death in
a totally different way.

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:21.870 align:middle line:84%
You are no longer afraid
because you have already

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:24.394 align:middle line:84%
experienced paradise, and
you are therefore free.

00:41:24.394 --> 00:41:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK, now let's
talk about some of the places

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:29.890 align:middle line:84%
you take them where people
have their own version

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:32.950 align:middle line:84%
of their experience--
of an experience.

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:34.980 align:middle line:90%
And let's go to Malta.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Ah, Malta.

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:37.855 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And again,
we're getting back

00:41:37.855 --> 00:41:41.330 align:middle line:84%
into the sacred aspect
of it in the frequencies

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:42.807 align:middle line:90%
of the land itself there.

00:41:42.807 --> 00:41:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, very much so.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:45.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Malta is
a very good example

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:49.300 align:middle line:84%
because recently there's a team
of the sound engineers that

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.880 align:middle line:84%
have been going around
monitoring sound frequencies

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.830 align:middle line:90%
at these temples.

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Malta, Great Britain,
Ireland, and also

00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.050 align:middle line:84%
northern France--
different chambers,

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:03.340 align:middle line:84%
all of them associated
with bridal chambers,

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and also the honeycomb
and the beehive.

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Most of these changes that are
associated with resurrection

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.100 align:middle line:84%
are always associated
with a beehive

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.524 align:middle line:84%
and even shaped like
a beehive, and there's

00:42:13.524 --> 00:42:15.690 align:middle line:84%
reasons for that which we'll
be here for a long time

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:16.450 align:middle line:90%
discussing.

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:18.685 align:middle line:84%
But the temples in
Malta specifically

00:42:18.685 --> 00:42:21.730 align:middle line:84%
are actually designed
in a certain way

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:24.610 align:middle line:84%
where the faces are
actually pockmarked to look

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:26.160 align:middle line:90%
like honeycombs.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.830 align:middle line:84%
They're totally unique,
and they're also unique

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:30.930 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that they
have an above ground

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:33.020 align:middle line:84%
chamber and a below the
ground chamber, which

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.580 align:middle line:90%
is adjacent to these places.

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is called
the Hypogeum of Hal Saflieni,

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and here, like in
other parts of Europe,

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:43.970 align:middle line:84%
the sound engineers found
that the resonant frequency

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:46.340 align:middle line:84%
of these chambers--
which again, painted

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:50.070 align:middle line:84%
with these honeycomb
patterns-- is 112 Hertz,

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:51.889 align:middle line:84%
and they thought, well,
that's interesting.

00:42:51.889 --> 00:42:54.305 align:middle line:84%
Well, they took a neurosurgeon
to look at that information

00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:55.560 align:middle line:90%
and say, well, wait a minute.

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.400 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
important frequency,

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.880 align:middle line:84%
because 112 Hertz is
the exact point where

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.580 align:middle line:84%
something happens to
your prefrontal cortex

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:04.640 align:middle line:90%
in your brain.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.510 align:middle line:84%
It stops you thinking
and analyzing,

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and it starts to get you into
a state of altered awareness.

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:13.915 align:middle line:84%
It starts bringing in
that state of imagination.

00:43:13.915 --> 00:43:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what these chambers
were doing in the first place.

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:19.644 align:middle line:84%
So now we know, using
modern equipment,

00:43:19.644 --> 00:43:21.310 align:middle line:84%
what these chambers
were actually doing.

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:23.860 align:middle line:84%
They were specially designed
with a certain frequency

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.780 align:middle line:84%
to get you to stop
thinking and start feeling,

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and that's the whole point
that gets you out of your body.

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:31.759 align:middle line:84%
You can't think your way
and intellectualize your way

00:43:31.759 --> 00:43:32.300 align:middle line:90%
through this.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.400 align:middle line:90%
You have to experience it.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did the Templars
utilize this space?

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:39.337 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Not the one in Malta.

00:43:39.337 --> 00:43:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, because
I don't remember

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.070 align:middle line:90%
the age of the one in Malta.

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, it's at
least 10,000 years.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 10,000 years.

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:48.754 align:middle line:84%
But they never crossed
over into that?

00:43:48.754 --> 00:43:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The Knights
of Saint John

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:53.015 align:middle line:84%
did, but we don't know to what
degree they had established

00:43:53.015 --> 00:43:54.640 align:middle line:84%
that, because the
Knights of Saint John

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.032 align:middle line:84%
essentially became an arm
of the Catholic Church,

00:43:57.032 --> 00:43:58.990 align:middle line:84%
so we don't know to what
degree they were still

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:00.750 align:middle line:90%
following the old principles.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:01.520 align:middle line:90%
Maybe some did.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.270 align:middle line:90%
Maybe some didn't.

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:03.644 align:middle line:84%
I know a couple
people today that

00:44:03.644 --> 00:44:07.230 align:middle line:84%
are practicing the traditional
practices of the Templars

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:10.170 align:middle line:84%
through the Knights of
Malta, but not in association

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:14.450 align:middle line:84%
with the Catholic Church because
the two don't go together.

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:16.800 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think they're
actually pursuing the same way.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
wondering-- the Hypogeum,

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.272 align:middle line:84%
I assume you've
taken people there?

00:44:20.272 --> 00:44:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, yes.

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's talk.

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:23.700 align:middle line:90%
I've wanted to go there.

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
particular experience.

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.819 align:middle line:84%
Give us an example of what
some people might experience.

00:44:29.819 --> 00:44:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Actually
the best experience

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:35.170 align:middle line:84%
came from one of the people who
is-- because you can't actually

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:37.202 align:middle line:90%
go there through actual tours.

00:44:37.202 --> 00:44:38.660 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
an official guide.

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So you're given the original
story, which is partly

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:45.350 align:middle line:84%
true and partly what the
archaeologists would like you

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:47.990 align:middle line:90%
to know, but I was very lucky.

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was given one person
who confided in me--

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:55.660 align:middle line:84%
and while the people
were busy taking

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:59.834 align:middle line:84%
in one particular chamber, she
pulls me to the side and says,

00:44:59.834 --> 00:45:01.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
goes on in here,

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:02.930 align:middle line:90%
but this was my big dream.

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:05.660 align:middle line:84%
I really wanted to come and
be a guide in this chamber

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:06.785 align:middle line:90%
since I was a little child.

00:45:06.785 --> 00:45:07.960 align:middle line:90%
I said, why?

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:08.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:12.220 align:middle line:84%
I felt moved by this place,
and during quiet times,

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:13.944 align:middle line:84%
when no one's
here, I come down--

00:45:13.944 --> 00:45:15.360 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to
understand there

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.730 align:middle line:84%
are three layers of
tunnels with chambers.

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:21.850 align:middle line:84%
It's about a quarter of a
mile of chambers, 33 of them.

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I
feel particularly

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.330 align:middle line:84%
moved to stand in
this particular one,

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:28.910 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out it's the
most resonant of the chambers,

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:32.057 align:middle line:84%
and it's the one specifically
where the sound engineers

00:45:32.057 --> 00:45:33.140 align:middle line:90%
discovered that frequency.

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Found the
112 Hertz, yeah.

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.854 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So without
realizing it,

00:45:35.854 --> 00:45:37.840 align:middle line:84%
she actually picked
up intuitively

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.280 align:middle line:84%
that this is the
place you stand,

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.080 align:middle line:84%
and she says I usually sing,
or I atone, or I say a prayer,

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:47.270 align:middle line:84%
and I feel moved, and I
feel like I receive visions

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:48.680 align:middle line:90%
and guidance when I'm here.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.396 align:middle line:90%
Bingo.

00:45:49.396 --> 00:45:51.020 align:middle line:84%
So without realizing
it, she's actually

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.830 align:middle line:84%
practicing a little bit of a
raising of the dead ceremony

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:54.684 align:middle line:90%
at this location.

00:45:54.684 --> 00:45:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And now all of these ceremonies
also come back to one factor,

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:04.300 align:middle line:84%
and that is the
notion of what is God?

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And I took a few of the
points you made in your book--

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.290 align:middle line:84%
the counts, for
example-- considering

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:15.160 align:middle line:84%
the other world and
the intelligence,

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:20.010 align:middle line:84%
the creative force, in the other
world as only a whisper away.

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yes, it's much
closer than we think,

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and again it comes back
to the Western concept

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:28.530 align:middle line:84%
that we've been given, which is
God is way out there somewhere,

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:29.230 align:middle line:90%
and you're here.

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're separated, and
you want to get there,

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.030 align:middle line:90%
you talk to us.

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:34.090 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Even Jesus himself
admitted the temple of God

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:37.990 align:middle line:90%
resides within everybody.

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:39.320 align:middle line:90%
You just have to discover it.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.590 align:middle line:84%
You have to find a mechanism
with which to access that,

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and the mechanism is to allow
your body to temporarily--

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:49.115 align:middle line:84%
or your soul to temporarily
leave your body, even if just

00:46:49.115 --> 00:46:52.760 align:middle line:84%
for a few seconds to go and
connect with that source.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And you do it through
meditation, Kriya yoga,

00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:58.110 align:middle line:84%
or though this
resurrection ceremony.

00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the concept
that the Celts had,

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and the Egyptians
had, and the Chinese

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.700 align:middle line:90%
had was exactly the same.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:09.140 align:middle line:84%
It was a specifically
defined location

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:12.200 align:middle line:84%
where, under certain
conditions, you actually

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.990 align:middle line:84%
access another level
of reality, but it's

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:16.530 align:middle line:84%
still within that
level of reality,

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:17.800 align:middle line:90%
you are still within yourself.

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:18.840 align:middle line:90%
That's the paradox.

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.449 align:middle line:90%
You're not going out there.

00:47:20.449 --> 00:47:21.990 align:middle line:84%
You're going out
there allegorically.

00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're going into
another dimension of yourself.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:26.015 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Exactly, you're just
shifting the radio station,

00:47:26.015 --> 00:47:28.590 align:middle line:84%
but you're still within
the same radio receiver.

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So instead of being
here at 88 FM,

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:32.744 align:middle line:90%
you're now up here at 100 FM.

00:47:32.744 --> 00:47:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
what do you think

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:38.340 align:middle line:84%
is happening then,
if god is within,

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:40.360 align:middle line:84%
and each of these
people are going

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:44.200 align:middle line:84%
into this unique experience into
a finer range of frequencies

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:49.610 align:middle line:84%
to have maybe an altered and
finer experience of that which

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:52.090 align:middle line:90%
we call God?

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It was a
self-empowering experience.

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:57.390 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to find
out who they are,

00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:59.740 align:middle line:84%
what was their purpose
before they came here,

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:02.220 align:middle line:84%
and what is their purpose in
the bigger scheme of things.

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing I kept
reading again and again--

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:07.216 align:middle line:84%
in the few people
who almost describe

00:48:07.216 --> 00:48:08.590 align:middle line:84%
what they saw on
the other side--

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:10.420 align:middle line:90%
they were very coy about this.

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.260 align:middle line:84%
They kept saying
the same concepts,

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:14.450 align:middle line:90%
which is we met with gods.

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:15.660 align:middle line:90%
We met with angels.

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:18.180 align:middle line:84%
We met with ancestors,
and depending

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.935 align:middle line:84%
on what the intent was
that we took there,

00:48:19.935 --> 00:48:21.930 align:middle line:84%
we would be given
specific information.

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was all about allowing
us to discover ourselves

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:28.090 align:middle line:84%
so we'd know ourselves
while we're actually awake

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:30.240 align:middle line:84%
in the physical body,
because the ancestors

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.030 align:middle line:84%
recognize the living
condition for what

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:35.070 align:middle line:90%
it is, a spiritual death.

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
live your life alive

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.740 align:middle line:84%
and not consider your
life being a life which

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:42.970 align:middle line:84%
is bookended by pain--
birth, death, and pain

00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:45.880 align:middle line:84%
in the middle-- in order to
break away from that cycle,

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.470 align:middle line:84%
you have to get out of
your body and connect

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:52.070 align:middle line:84%
with these sorts of things--
God, the divine feminine,

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:54.470 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to
call it-- and come back

00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:57.320 align:middle line:84%
into the body with that
information consciously

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.050 align:middle line:84%
so you can apply it
on a conscious level

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:01.002 align:middle line:90%
and live your life aware.

00:49:01.002 --> 00:49:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, you are
awake, and you are aware,

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:04.380 align:middle line:90%
and you are risen.

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this also
generally goes hand in hand

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.471 align:middle line:84%
with losing the fear
of physical death.

00:49:09.471 --> 00:49:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Absolutely, and
so many of the people--

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is what the
human species is a slave to.

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:15.511 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:49:15.511 --> 00:49:16.010 align:middle line:90%
Pain.

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it does hurt
when you're down here.

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But also the
fear of no longer existing.

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The fear of death.

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:22.466 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And look
at the Templars,

00:49:22.466 --> 00:49:24.280 align:middle line:84%
the most recent
example of people

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.070 align:middle line:90%
who died for their beliefs.

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:28.380 align:middle line:84%
So many accounts I've
read of the Templars going

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:30.200 align:middle line:84%
to their deaths,
and it was gruesome.

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Being burnt alive is not fun.

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Friday the 13th.

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they
actually went there

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.885 align:middle line:84%
with a smile on their
face because they

00:49:34.885 --> 00:49:37.910 align:middle line:84%
knew if they could just-- it's
almost like mastering yoga.

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:40.550 align:middle line:84%
If you can just master the
pain for those few minutes

00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:43.360 align:middle line:84%
while the flesh is
on fire, you know

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.035 align:middle line:84%
that this is a
temporary existence,

00:49:45.035 --> 00:49:47.160 align:middle line:84%
and you're about to go on
to something much better,

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.660 align:middle line:84%
because they've
already been there,

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:50.701 align:middle line:84%
and it goes back to what
the Egyptians was saying

00:49:50.701 --> 00:49:53.220 align:middle line:84%
in the Pyramid of
Unas, the oldest

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:57.570 align:middle line:84%
of the ceremonial chambers,
which is this method

00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:00.890 align:middle line:84%
has been proven to be
true a million times.

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So in 2500 BC, god knows
how many people had already

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.550 align:middle line:90%
had this experience.

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:07.760 align:middle line:90%
It was all had by them.

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was.

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:09.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I wanted
to ask about that.

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Who were the Followers of Horus?

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:13.965 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh now, the
followers of Horus.

00:50:13.965 --> 00:50:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Shining Ones.

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:16.930 align:middle line:90%
The Followers of Horus.

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: This goes
back a long, long way.

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:21.610 align:middle line:84%
There was a huge
catastrophe which

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:25.590 align:middle line:84%
hit the Earth in 9703
BC-- Tuesday, maybe

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Wednesday-- it's been proved
in the geologic record.

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Seven pieces of a
comet struck the Earth

00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:34.410 align:middle line:84%
at the same time in
exactly the right locations

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:36.740 align:middle line:84%
to create the most
possible havoc.

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Before that time,
the surviving text

00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:41.470 align:middle line:84%
talk about a time which is a
golden age, a time of creator

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:43.820 align:middle line:84%
gods when humans
are actually bigger,

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.990 align:middle line:84%
and there were also
Neanderthals, of course,

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:47.660 align:middle line:84%
but there was also
a humanoid race here

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:49.450 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth, which
knew something

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:51.390 align:middle line:90%
about the mechanics of nature.

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were
declared creator gods.

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:55.639 align:middle line:84%
They built cities of
knowledge, and of course they

00:50:55.639 --> 00:50:57.180 align:middle line:84%
saw this coming,
and they said, well,

00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:59.090 align:middle line:84%
whoever survives
is going to have

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:01.180 align:middle line:84%
to rebuild the former
mansions of the gods

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:04.010 align:middle line:84%
to rebuild these temples
so that people know how

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:07.970 align:middle line:84%
to be perfection of themselves,
and also to be a bright start,

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:10.860 align:middle line:84%
to be as a god, because
if you lose your way

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:14.800 align:middle line:84%
and you connect with the lesser
base frequencies of nature

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.970 align:middle line:84%
like fear, you're
going to lose your way.

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:19.595 align:middle line:84%
So the survivors are going to be
called the Followers of Horus,

00:51:19.595 --> 00:51:22.840 align:middle line:84%
and Horus, of course, is
the birth child of Osiris.

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:25.450 align:middle line:84%
It's Osiris
spiritualized and reborn.

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:28.820 align:middle line:84%
He is the son that sits
on the lap of Isis.

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:30.320 align:middle line:84%
We know this image
today, of course,

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.620 align:middle line:84%
is Mary with baby Jesus
on the lap-- same story.

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And the Followers of Horus were
also called the Shining Ones,

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and they were the people
who survived the flood,

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:43.360 align:middle line:84%
and then they became
the pharaohs of Egypt

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:45.880 align:middle line:84%
who were described as
half human, half divine

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:49.140 align:middle line:84%
because they had to interbreed
with ordinary human women

00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:51.510 align:middle line:84%
in order to maintain
that bloodline.

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite telling
when you get to about 3100

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:58.990 align:middle line:84%
BC where the Egyptian
history quite categorically

00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:02.930 align:middle line:84%
claims that the first
pharaoh of a purely human

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:05.990 align:middle line:84%
bloodline-- their words--
ascends to the throne,

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:08.010 align:middle line:84%
and that was the Pharaoh
Menes, and that's

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:10.474 align:middle line:84%
when the bloodline began
to really thin out.

00:52:10.474 --> 00:52:11.890 align:middle line:84%
The last of their
kind, of course,

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:15.320 align:middle line:84%
was Amenhotep III,
Akhenaten, his son,

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.510 align:middle line:90%
and his son Tutankhamun.

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell
by the photographs,

00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:21.360 align:middle line:84%
their skulls are totally
shaped in a very different way.

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to Britain, you'll
find the same people buried

00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:27.740 align:middle line:84%
in giant's graves also with
the very elongated skull,

00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:33.640 align:middle line:84%
and all the traditions talk
about these people as being

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:36.300 align:middle line:84%
a highly developed race
which came from a long,

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:39.110 align:middle line:84%
long time ago,--
again, humanoid--

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:41.630 align:middle line:84%
but they had one foot
in the spiritual world,

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:45.260 align:middle line:84%
and in order to keep that level
of connection to the spirit

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:48.570 align:middle line:84%
world and function here
on the physical world,

00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:49.820 align:middle line:90%
they needed a larger head.

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.695 align:middle line:84%
They needed to have a
spiritual brain as well

00:52:51.695 --> 00:52:55.860 align:middle line:84%
as a mental brain, because you
and I have a big frontal cortex

00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:57.620 align:middle line:84%
because we have to
process information.

00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:00.030 align:middle line:84%
We have to pay bills and
take care of mundane things

00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:00.740 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:04.050 align:middle line:84%
They needed to have one
foot in the spiritual world,

00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:09.070 align:middle line:84%
so their head had to follow
that concept of all form

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:11.470 align:middle line:84%
follows function, so that
makes a lot of sense.

00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:13.880 align:middle line:84%
They had to have different
bodies to house that bigger

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.640 align:middle line:90%
frequency that they had.

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do you believe
that it's from the Shining Ones

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:22.320 align:middle line:84%
that the notion of
living resurrection

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:25.472 align:middle line:90%
was perpetuated into humanity?

00:53:25.472 --> 00:53:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I think so, because
some of the oldest texts

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:31.110 align:middle line:84%
talk about these people wearing
white, or shimmering in white,

00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and I always wondered why the
Essenes, and the Mandaeans,

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and all the people going
back to Babylon, all the way

00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:39.660 align:middle line:84%
to the followers of the
way and the gentlemen

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:41.950 align:middle line:84%
of the way in China--
they always wear white.

00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, we associate
that with purity,

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:45.550 align:middle line:84%
but it had to come
from somewhere,

00:53:45.550 --> 00:53:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and the oldest
expressions I can find

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:50.820 align:middle line:84%
is of the Shining Ones and
the Followers of Horus,

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:54.390 align:middle line:84%
who also wore white habits, and
they declared themselves pure.

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And they also followed the
tradition of ritual baptism

00:53:57.970 --> 00:54:00.390 align:middle line:84%
as the first level
of initiation.

00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:04.140 align:middle line:84%
So in the Essenes and John the
Baptist and Jesus' practices

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:07.361 align:middle line:84%
and the Templars too, we are
seeing this very old tradition

00:54:07.361 --> 00:54:09.360 align:middle line:84%
that comes all the way
back to the Shining Ones,

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.720 align:middle line:84%
and I believe it is the
Book of Ezekiel in the Bible

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:14.430 align:middle line:84%
that also describes these
Shining Ones and Watchers

00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:16.909 align:middle line:90%
as being men in white, as well.

00:54:16.909 --> 00:54:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Quite a
gift that was left.

00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's quite a very
ancient tradition

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:24.760 align:middle line:84%
of priests who basically
were there as living examples

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.570 align:middle line:90%
of gods, but they were god men.

00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:29.950 align:middle line:84%
They are men and women
who had become god-like--

00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:33.450 align:middle line:84%
not to be gods themselves,
but as the gods

00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:34.967 align:middle line:90%
while they're here on Earth.

00:54:34.967 --> 00:54:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We only have a
couple of minutes left, Freddy,

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:37.900 align:middle line:90%
so during--

00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, no.

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:39.598 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I know.

00:54:39.598 --> 00:54:40.160 align:middle line:90%
It flies.

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.260 align:middle line:84%
During all of your
research for this,

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:46.140 align:middle line:84%
was there anything that came as
a particular surprise to you?

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:48.105 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, everything
comes as a surprise.

00:54:48.105 --> 00:54:49.105 align:middle line:90%
Well, the big surprise--

00:54:49.105 --> 00:54:50.813 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Greatest
revelation, let's say.

00:54:50.813 --> 00:54:54.575 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --was how everything
goes back so far beyond what

00:54:54.575 --> 00:54:57.200 align:middle line:84%
the perception that we're being
given, and the biggest surprise

00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:59.680 align:middle line:84%
really was-- and having
been a person who

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.140 align:middle line:84%
was raised as a Catholic,
the biggest shock was

00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:05.910 align:middle line:84%
the origins of the word or the
name, the title Jesus Christ,

00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and how much
further back it goes

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:10.890 align:middle line:84%
into time-- all the way to
Mongolia, all the way to China.

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:15.604 align:middle line:84%
We have a god in
Japan in-- I believe

00:55:15.604 --> 00:55:19.760 align:middle line:84%
it was 1800 BC, who
was nailed to a cross,

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.302 align:middle line:90%
gets up three days later.

00:55:21.302 --> 00:55:23.135 align:middle line:84%
And that was the biggest
revelation of all--

00:55:23.135 --> 00:55:24.890 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus was a
very special person.

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:29.160 align:middle line:84%
He was basically a long
list, a long line of people,

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.740 align:middle line:84%
of ordinary people
like you and I,

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:34.320 align:middle line:84%
who had developed a finer
level of perception,

00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:36.280 align:middle line:84%
asked the right questions,
was indoctrinated

00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:38.890 align:middle line:84%
into a special
initiation technique,

00:55:38.890 --> 00:55:41.760 align:middle line:84%
and was able to see and
experience for himself

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.180 align:middle line:90%
we can do much more than this.

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:45.010 align:middle line:84%
We can be better than
ourselves, and we

00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:48.570 align:middle line:84%
could walk upright in total
control of our manifestation

00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:49.280 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:53.200 align:middle line:84%
We can be risen and Christ
in our normal waking life.

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not
an old tradition.

00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:57.194 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that's applicable today.

00:55:57.194 --> 00:55:58.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not some old
information that

00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:00.660 align:middle line:84%
was relevant then
and irrelevant now.

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.950 align:middle line:84%
It's actually more
relevant now than it's ever

00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:06.010 align:middle line:84%
been because we've lost so
much of that connection,

00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:08.240 align:middle line:84%
and especially to the
land and to the spirit

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:11.410 align:middle line:84%
that we need this information
more than ever now.

00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Really quickly,
over the next year

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:15.200 align:middle line:84%
or so, where are some
of the sites you're

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.340 align:middle line:90%
going to be taking people to?

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:18.048 align:middle line:84%
Just in case someone
out here is thinking

00:56:18.048 --> 00:56:20.390 align:middle line:90%
I want to jump on board.

00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:21.530 align:middle line:90%
I know where I want to go.

00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:22.422 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I know
where you want to go.

00:56:22.422 --> 00:56:24.297 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I'm waiting
until you go there,

00:56:24.297 --> 00:56:26.820 align:middle line:84%
but let's talk about where you
are going over the next year.

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:28.778 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I just came back
from Peru and Bolivia

00:56:28.778 --> 00:56:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and also discovered places
there where they also

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.760 align:middle line:84%
practiced the living
resurrection principles, which

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:35.770 align:middle line:90%
totally surprised me.

00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:37.469 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:56:37.469 --> 00:56:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go to Britain,
of course, as always.

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:40.718 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to get to Ireland.

00:56:40.718 --> 00:56:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I want to have a different
type of Irish experience.

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.470 align:middle line:84%
There will be pubs
involved, of course.

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:48.740 align:middle line:84%
France is always-- some
of the sites there.

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:52.590 align:middle line:10%
And I really would like to
start also going to Angkor,

00:56:52.590 --> 00:56:54.260 align:middle line:10%
because that place
fascinates me--

00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:56.390 align:middle line:10%
64 square miles
of temples, and I

00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:58.390 align:middle line:10%
believe they are also
much older than they claim

00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:02.590 align:middle line:10%
to be-- and also do things which
also test me as well in terms

00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:06.030 align:middle line:10%
of getting me out of my
comfort zone, like Gobekli Tepe

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:09.120 align:middle line:10%
and going back to Baalbek,
there's one in Lebanon--

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:12.450 align:middle line:10%
the biggest stones on
the Earth, 1,600 tons.

00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:15.800 align:middle line:84%
They did this for a
very, very good reason.

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:18.747 align:middle line:10%
And also possibly Portugal, as
well-- look at the Templar work

00:57:18.747 --> 00:57:21.080 align:middle line:10%
there, because they've got
some fascinating sites there.

00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:21.960 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Do you
ever go to Malta?

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.800 align:middle line:10%
Do you take people
to Malta any longer?

00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:26.590 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: I used to, but I
don't at the moment because

00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:29.180 align:middle line:10%
of the way that the
money from the EU

00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:32.740 align:middle line:10%
is being used to turn these
places into tourist sites,

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:34.340 align:middle line:10%
and they have these
metal ramps that

00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:37.320 align:middle line:10%
go into these beautiful
limestone temples,

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:38.639 align:middle line:10%
and they're too incongruous.

00:57:38.639 --> 00:57:40.180 align:middle line:84%
You are now not even
allowed to touch

00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:41.670 align:middle line:84%
the soil on which
a temple is on,

00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and I feel that
there's a disconnect

00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:48.340 align:middle line:84%
between these modern
intrusive gang planks

00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:50.424 align:middle line:84%
that go into these temples
and the old temples.

00:57:50.424 --> 00:57:52.090 align:middle line:10%
I feel there's a
better way of doing it,

00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:54.547 align:middle line:10%
and I had a chat with someone
there who's very influential

00:57:54.547 --> 00:57:56.380 align:middle line:10%
and just maybe they'll
get rid of that stuff

00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:59.180 align:middle line:10%
and just put rubber mats.

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:00.160 align:middle line:90%
They're unobtrusive.

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.160 align:middle line:90%
They don't make a sound.

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.570 align:middle line:84%
You're not destroying
the temple,

00:58:02.570 --> 00:58:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and you can actually put
your feet on the ground,

00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and they flow with
the actual temple.

00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:07.614 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not
disruptive energies either.

00:58:07.614 --> 00:58:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:11.180 align:middle line:84%
So when they get that
right-- I'm a purist.

00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:12.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm a romantic at heart.

00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:14.090 align:middle line:84%
I want to see things
exactly as they were.

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:15.465 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't
write it down.

00:58:15.465 --> 00:58:17.700 align:middle line:84%
What's your URL if people
want to jump on board?

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:19.640 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: Oh, the
important thing.
