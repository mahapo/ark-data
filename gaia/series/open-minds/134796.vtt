[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:27.804 --> 00:00:30.220 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Perhaps the
deepest area of exploration

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.800 align:middle line:10%
that any of us will undertake
is the journey into connection

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.630 align:middle line:10%
with our own soul force.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Known by many names, there
is no journey more rewarding,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.500 align:middle line:84%
nor more convoluted, than
coming to know thyself.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.200 align:middle line:84%
But in doing so, we
become a free species,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.600 align:middle line:84%
unable to be controlled
by outside forces

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:90%
and alive with possibility.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.710 align:middle line:90%
Carrie, this is your area.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Carrie L'Esperance
is with us today.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And when I was reading
your book, just

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.810 align:middle line:84%
from the very first pages,
I saw this incredibly mature

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:84%
understanding of what's needed
today, and also of the notion

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.740 align:middle line:84%
of what it takes to begin
connecting with soul,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:90%
which is my passion as well.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So I have almost
every ear dog paged,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.240 align:middle line:84%
because we're on the
same page, literally.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CARRIE L'ESPERANCE:
Wonderful so happy to hear it.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First of all, I want
to say something that is just

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.250 align:middle line:90%
coming up more and more.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not taking a
swipe at the male species,

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.020 align:middle line:84%
but maybe the more masculine way
of functioning in the world--

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.179 align:middle line:84%
that most of the books, most
of the religions, almost

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:33.970 align:middle line:84%
everything that's
perpetuated in the world,

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.710 align:middle line:84%
is through the male mind,
often generally men.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:84%
The reality is that while
the left side of the brain

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:84%
is pretty good at putting
function together,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.480 align:middle line:84%
structure together,
my personal experience

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.200 align:middle line:84%
is that the people who
experience these realities more

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.600 align:middle line:84%
naturally are women, or the
feminine aspect of being.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.630 align:middle line:84%
What do you have say about that,
before we even get rolling?

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: You
know, I've heard this.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.360 align:middle line:10%
But the truth is, what
you're talking about

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.520 align:middle line:10%
is basically intuition.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.230 align:middle line:10%
And everyone has intuition.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.000 align:middle line:10%
But it's like a muscle
that has to be exercised.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.390 align:middle line:84%
So men are very trained
to think linearly.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.640 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Actually, scientifically
it's proven that women do

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.780 align:middle line:84%
have what's called
a thicker corpus

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:84%
callosum in the brain
that connects the right

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and left hemispheres
of the brain.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And that enables women to more
easily bounce back and forth

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.540 align:middle line:84%
between linear thinking and
more non-linear thinking.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So they say, yes, women
have this-- more naturally

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.125 align:middle line:90%
they have it.

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And multitasking
falls within that, where

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.541 align:middle line:90%
you're flipping back and forth.

00:02:57.541 --> 00:02:58.760 align:middle line:90%
Oh gosh, I have to do that.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm still doing that.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: But honestly,
my feeling about it is that

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:84%
if-- women have been using this
because they've had to use it--

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.580 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: --to survive--

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE:
--in a man's world.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: The body,
on an evolutionary scale,

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:84%
would begin to develop
more in that direction.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.262 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily that men
don't have the ability to--

00:03:26.262 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're right.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:90%
We all have it.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: --let's say,
grow a thicker corpus callosum.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think women have evolved
this way because they've

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.410 align:middle line:90%
been allowed to.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.168 align:middle line:84%
And because this has been
societal conditioning

00:03:41.168 --> 00:03:44.290 align:middle line:84%
for a few thousand
years, on both sides.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:84%
But what I find is--
and it's interesting.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're very
good at expression--

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.770 align:middle line:84%
personal expression--
and putting language

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.750 align:middle line:90%
to the non-physical reality.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.820 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times
the people that

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:84%
do experience it
so deeply, and who

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.520 align:middle line:84%
I can have these
conversations with,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.039 align:middle line:84%
can't always verbalize it to the
same degree, in a linear sense.

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So most of the people I
interview on these topics

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.340 align:middle line:90%
are men, is what I'm saying.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: OK.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.903 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For that reason.

00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Because the facility
to experience it

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:84%
can't exactly be laid into words
the way that we would prefer,

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.150 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes, I think--

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you've done
a pretty darn good job.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.291 align:middle line:84%
I'm just pointing this out,
because it's a conversation

00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:28.600 align:middle line:90%
we need to get at.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.807 align:middle line:84%
But it's a conversation
about non-physical realms,

00:04:30.807 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:90%
and connecting, and the need to.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.610 align:middle line:90%
And you've done a beautiful job.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a journey
back into your own life.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And when did you become aware
that this deep connection was

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.920 align:middle line:84%
not only available, but
was absolutely necessary?

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: From
the time I was a child,

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.450 align:middle line:84%
I've had this deep
connection with my soul.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:84%
From the time I
was very young, I

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.790 align:middle line:84%
felt like I was much
older than my body.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if we
recognize that every soul has

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.880 align:middle line:84%
a fingerprint, a unique
fingerprint-- just

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.070 align:middle line:84%
like our fingers have
unique fingerprints,

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.800 align:middle line:84%
each soul has a
unique fingerprint.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And there are definitely
different levels of souls.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.520 align:middle line:90%
Some are beginner souls.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.540 align:middle line:90%
Some are advanced.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:90%
And some are old souls.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And so the journey
in the physical body

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.540 align:middle line:90%
is really exactly what it is.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a journey.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And every soul comes in to a
physical, third dimensional

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.940 align:middle line:84%
reality, with a soul
contract, with something

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.540 align:middle line:84%
that you're supposed
to work out.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And the soul knows
what that work is.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.870 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so important
to connect with the soul.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Because third dimensional
physical reality

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.350 align:middle line:90%
is designed for distraction.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.250 align:middle line:84%
There's so many ways people
can get off track in life.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost as
though it's on purpose.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.900 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as though,
from the time we're young,

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.800 align:middle line:84%
we aren't taught about
the deeper realities,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.730 align:middle line:84%
although we know
that they're there,

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.810 align:middle line:90%
and we know that they exist.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.050 align:middle line:84%
But we aren't really
supported in learning

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.250 align:middle line:90%
about personal power.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe
that if children

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.570 align:middle line:84%
were taught, from a very young
age, about who they really are

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.910 align:middle line:84%
and what they really
are capable of,

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.650 align:middle line:84%
it would be a very
different world.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also, if they
were taught to simply live

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.630 align:middle line:90%
in their own true way--

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --so that
the parents could even

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:84%
help in the process
of observation,

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.530 align:middle line:84%
to see where they're
naturally gravitating,

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.160 align:middle line:84%
then the parents could even
help reinforce these paths

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.780 align:middle line:90%
of discovery they're on.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.680 align:middle line:90%
But we don't do that.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.200 align:middle line:90%
We have a plan for our children.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Well,
you're a child,

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and you come into the
world, and you're put in,

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.760 align:middle line:84%
let's say-- like
I was-- catechism.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And you learn that
you're a sinner.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And you learn that you
are to worship that which

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.520 align:middle line:90%
is outside of yourself.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:84%
You are to seek
what you are looking

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.440 align:middle line:90%
for everywhere but within.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I always thought
everybody else was just

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.560 align:middle line:90%
like me.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
that I did was

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.120 align:middle line:90%
from that place, deep within.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And I would see people
getting married at young ages,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:84%
or doing all kinds of
things that they had plenty

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.400 align:middle line:84%
of time to do, but
they were pressured

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.530 align:middle line:90%
by cultural conditioning.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: And I would ask
them, well, ask your higher

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:56.930 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.020 align:middle line:90%
Go deeper.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.400 align:middle line:90%
Go deeper within.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you know what's
right and what your path is.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.100 align:middle line:90%
And I've always lived this way.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And my work in the
world has always

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:17.490 align:middle line:84%
been in alignment with, I guess,
the old adage, know thyself.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.290 align:middle line:90%
Know thyself.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Seek to know thyself.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: And my path
has been one of observation,

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.890 align:middle line:84%
one of experience,
one of research.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.039 align:middle line:84%
And the experience,
I have to say,

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.426 align:middle line:90%
is the most powerful teacher.

00:08:37.426 --> 00:08:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.299 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Life
is the master teacher.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, I
felt that it was

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.300 align:middle line:84%
very important at
this point in my life

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:84%
to write a book
that helped people

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:84%
to understand what is really
happening in the world, why

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
it's happening, and
what we can do about it.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:03.630 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't been an easy path to
understand or to learn about.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And I also felt like I
was putting myself out

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.350 align:middle line:84%
on the line a bit by adding
certain things to the book.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.405 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I understand.

00:09:11.405 --> 00:09:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE:
But I felt that it

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.960 align:middle line:84%
was imperative to
add the things that

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.900 align:middle line:84%
were more difficult for people
to receive and understand

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.390 align:middle line:84%
than not to add them,
because it's a big picture.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:28.005 align:middle line:84%
And everything is woven
together, like a tapestry.

00:09:28.005 --> 00:09:33.150 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who understands life,
and the processes of life,

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:46.560 align:middle line:84%
can see that it's a
hierarchical, planetary design.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
seed needs the soil.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.740 align:middle line:90%
The soil needs the rain.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:10:00.710 align:middle line:84%
The plant flowers because of
the sunlight and the nurturing

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:01.840 align:middle line:90%
nutrients in the soil.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.640 align:middle line:90%
All these things--

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.972 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Released by the rain.

00:10:03.972 --> 00:10:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: It's
all reciprocal.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.800 align:middle line:90%
Life is reciprocal.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:12.850 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand
this also about ourselves.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And we have to get away from
the idea that what we want

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.434 align:middle line:84%
is not necessarily
what our work is.

00:10:23.434 --> 00:10:24.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No,
because we're coming

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.410 align:middle line:90%
from another aspect of being.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.790 align:middle line:84%
We're usually
coming from what we

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.664 align:middle line:84%
call the conscious mind,
which, of course, is

00:10:29.664 --> 00:10:31.300 align:middle line:84%
the least conscious
part of our mind--

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.840 align:middle line:84%
is our conscious mind, which
also has to do with desire

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.460 align:middle line:90%
and a number of other things.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.290 align:middle line:84%
It's also societally
conditioned,

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.070 align:middle line:84%
driven by the
subconscious, right?

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Very much so.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So those
kinds of desires

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.950 align:middle line:84%
may not be in alignment
with what this has in mind.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And one thing you
say in the book

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.070 align:middle line:84%
is, it's kind of surprising
that so few people genuinely

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.330 align:middle line:90%
choose to take this journey.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.411 align:middle line:84%
And I find this
surprising as well.

00:10:56.411 --> 00:10:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Well
like I mentioned

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.700 align:middle line:84%
before, I thought everybody
else was just like me.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And it took a long time
for me to understand

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.370 align:middle line:90%
that this wasn't the case.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably the
reason that the world

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.980 align:middle line:84%
is standing at this threshold
that we're at right now,

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:84%
this critical time
that we're in.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I named the
book "Soul Breathing."

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Because soul breathing is what
you would call whole brain

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:23.590 align:middle line:90%
thinking.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:28.180 align:middle line:84%
It's connecting the
intellect with the deeper

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:90%
wisdom of the soul.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And when the two come together,
you have whole brain thinking.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand
this about yourself,

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:46.870 align:middle line:84%
you begin to recognize that
it's a reciprocal relationship

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:50.050 align:middle line:84%
that you receive, you
cultivate a higher

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:84%
frequency in your life,
through free will.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: That
higher frequency in turn

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:84%
allows the higher frequencies
of energies to come.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And you build upon that higher
frequency, that intelligence

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.460 align:middle line:90%
that you're receiving.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:15.520 align:middle line:84%
So really, alone,
we can do nothing.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Some people think
they are separated

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:24.370 align:middle line:84%
from this higher-- shall
we say, ephemeral energies.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's
imperative that people

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:31.750 align:middle line:84%
learn about the invisible
energies that they don't see.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.720 align:middle line:84%
When I wrote my
first book, it was

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:84%
about getting people
to think about what

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.430 align:middle line:84%
happens on the
inside of the body,

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.800 align:middle line:84%
rather than being very
focused on the outside.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.780 align:middle line:84%
We all can see when
our hair needs washing.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Or when we're dirty,
we need a shower.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:47.800 align:middle line:90%
That's very obvious.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.690 align:middle line:84%
But very few people
think about what's

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:51.670 align:middle line:84%
happening on the
inside of the body.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.410 align:middle line:90%
So you detox and you feel great.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize
how difficult

00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:03.340 align:middle line:84%
it is to remain balanced
in an unbalanced world.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: And so
what's the next step?

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, the next step is mine.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And so you begin to understand
and work with the fact

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.830 align:middle line:90%
that you do have a brain.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And then there are visible
aspects about thought,

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:27.820 align:middle line:84%
about information,
about frequency.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
invisible aspects.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And so these things
are very important,

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I think, for people
to learn about now--

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:42.010 align:middle line:84%
the invisible energies that
underlie existence, that

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.740 align:middle line:90%
make life possible.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:55.570 align:middle line:84%
The concern, the great concern,
is the unprecedented saturation

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.489 align:middle line:90%
of dissonant energies.

00:13:57.489 --> 00:13:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Particularly
with the unprecedented use

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:90%
of technology.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.860 align:middle line:84%
We're being bombarded
on every level

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.790 align:middle line:84%
of our field, every frequency
range that goes into the brain,

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.851 align:middle line:84%
with distraction,
disinformation, negativity.

00:14:09.851 --> 00:14:11.350 align:middle line:84%
For the most part,
very little of it

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.120 align:middle line:84%
is actually positive
reinforcement.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes, yes.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anxiety-producing
information, visuals,

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:23.380 align:middle line:84%
sounds et cetera-- and this
is very difficult for people

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.140 align:middle line:90%
to break through.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: When you
understand the ecstatic states,

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:36.100 align:middle line:84%
and when you experience
the ecstatic states that

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:41.950 align:middle line:84%
are possible in third
dimensional reality,

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and you compare it to, let's
for example, what they're

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.130 align:middle line:84%
putting on television,
what they're getting away

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:51.970 align:middle line:84%
with putting on television
now, and when you compare it

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:56.770 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that the
technology that's

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:03.850 align:middle line:84%
being marketed at such a
rapid rate today, all you see

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:84%
is the positive
marketing side of it.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.670 align:middle line:84%
But you won't see,
on the evening news,

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:90%
how dangerous the technology is.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: And
I object very strongly

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:25.210 align:middle line:84%
to having children being
exposed to this technology.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.010 align:middle line:90%
It is unprecedented.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.920 align:middle line:90%
It is unacceptable.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.960 align:middle line:84%
There is a professor at Lund
University in Sweden, Doctor--

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.380 align:middle line:84%
well, he's actually a
professor, Leif Salford.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.790 align:middle line:90%
He made a statement.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the-- and
this is the key word--

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:53.810 align:middle line:84%
voluntary use of cell phones,
being applied to the brain,

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:58.850 align:middle line:84%
is the largest human
experiment in history.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.426 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:16:00.426 --> 00:16:01.226 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:

00:16:01.226 --> 00:16:02.726 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE:
Interesting is right.

00:16:02.726 --> 00:16:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Because do we really all
want to be guinea pigs?

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.880 align:middle line:90%
Is that even legal?

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's acceptable.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.080 align:middle line:90%


00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I feel that our generation
has a great responsibility

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:31.310 align:middle line:84%
to educate the children,
to help them to understand

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:34.190 align:middle line:84%
who they really are,
and what they really

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:42.350 align:middle line:84%
are capable of achieving in
life, without the assistance

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:48.225 align:middle line:84%
of-- and I'm just going to say
it-- it's alien technology.

00:16:48.225 --> 00:16:50.840 align:middle line:90%


00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:56.360 align:middle line:10%
The frequencies that
emanate from this technology

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.370 align:middle line:10%
that they're bringing
onto the planet,

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:06.089 align:middle line:10%
so quickly that people barely
can have an opinion about it,

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:08.300 align:middle line:10%
is dissonant energy.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:13.970 align:middle line:84%
It's the opposite of
life-supportive energies.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy of the
downward spiral of death.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.260 align:middle line:10%
And so anyone who's
awake, anyone who

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:30.540 align:middle line:10%
has any kind of observatory--

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well,
discernment, yeah.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.020 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE: --skills would be
able to see that this is going

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:41.640 align:middle line:10%
to be-- the writing on the
wall is getting-- I guess,

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.910 align:middle line:10%
if I were to describe
it, you could, I suppose,

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.360 align:middle line:10%
say that it's like a
house being on fire,

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.870 align:middle line:10%
and everyone is
asleep in the attic.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.552 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: It's
not a casual matter.

00:17:55.552 --> 00:17:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's not.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Our brains are being
entrained to, as you say,

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:03.590 align:middle line:84%
these dissonant frequencies
almost 24/7 now.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Well
let's look at the fact

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.800 align:middle line:84%
that the pineal
gland in the brain

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.680 align:middle line:90%
is shaped like an inner eye.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
the pineal gland

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.320 align:middle line:84%
is the gland that
helps us to connect

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:26.310 align:middle line:84%
with-- it's the bridge
between matter and spirit.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:84%
If the pineal gland is right
at the point in the brain

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.800 align:middle line:84%
where we put the cell
phone up to the ear,

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.060 align:middle line:84%
those dissonant
energies are penetrating

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:39.990 align:middle line:84%
into the brain at the point
where the brain synopsis

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.660 align:middle line:90%
are firing rapidly.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And so after a certain amount
of time, that would definitely

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:54.900 align:middle line:84%
begin to, shall we say, cause
spiritual atrophy in the brain.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.560 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland
also manufactures

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.640 align:middle line:90%
melatonin for sleeping.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Many people are finding that
they might think they sleep,

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.589 align:middle line:84%
but they don't really wake up
feeling refreshed and restored.

00:19:06.589 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
they're just surfing,

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.180 align:middle line:90%
not at a very low level.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think what they're
hoping is that people are going

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:16.310 align:middle line:84%
to get used to feeling
just like a zombie,

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and get used to functioning
like maybe a computer.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
OK, and you also

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.070 align:middle line:84%
talk about the pineal
gland in the book

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and say it can't differentiate
between light and

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.000 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic waves.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.670 align:middle line:84%
What is the significance
of that statement?

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Well the
significance of that statement

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:41.690 align:middle line:84%
is that the body, and
the cells, and the brain

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:48.630 align:middle line:84%
all restore, and refresh,
and renew, and detoxify

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.790 align:middle line:90%
during sleep.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So if the body is
not allowed to--

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go into a genuinely
deep, healing sleep.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Exactly.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle line:84%
If it's not allowed its natural
processes, then what happens?

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.530 align:middle line:90%
We become something else.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And we know that these
frequencies have the ability

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.410 align:middle line:90%
to alter human DNA.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.630 align:middle line:90%
This has been proven.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And so where is the impetus
coming from for this dance

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.700 align:middle line:84%
that we're in, with all
these stray energies?

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.730 align:middle line:84%
These stray energies
are unregulated.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:32.420 align:middle line:90%
They are not regulated.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:38.570 align:middle line:84%
We know that they're slowly
turning up the signal.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And I know this, because
I live in San Francisco.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And even though I don't
subscribe to WiFi,

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.860 align:middle line:84%
my apartment is
saturated with it.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: I can't
get away from it.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can't
get away from it.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:50.564 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE:
It's not a choice.

00:20:50.564 --> 00:20:51.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't have free
choice anymore.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: So
this, in itself-- just

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:59.160 align:middle line:84%
that, by itself--
is very concerning.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And I have no-- and when
they first turned it on,

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a great
signal in my apartment.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:90%
And now it's at 99%.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK, so this
is similar to the story

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.140 align:middle line:84%
when you put the
frog in the pan.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.074 align:middle line:84%
And the frog doesn't--
you turn the heat on--

00:21:17.074 --> 00:21:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Boiling pot.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: --and
the frog doesn't

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:90%
realize it's being cooked.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.834 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:20.834 --> 00:21:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: So I
look at it like that.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.950 align:middle line:84%
I see it as frying
the energy frequency

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:33.410 align:middle line:84%
of our natural balance,
so that we no longer

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.486 align:middle line:90%
can maintain homeostasis.

00:21:35.486 --> 00:21:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about brain frequency

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.890 align:middle line:90%
specifically then.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.660 align:middle line:84%
In the book you
say we operate best

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.820 align:middle line:90%
between 72 and 90 megahertz.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's
actually happening to us?

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:50.360 align:middle line:84%
For those who can map the
brain, where, as a society, do

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.740 align:middle line:90%
we tend to be going now?

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.930 align:middle line:84%
What megahertz rage range
are we often operating

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.480 align:middle line:90%
in at large-- a mean?

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Well,
it's easier to give you

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:05.510 align:middle line:84%
a description of
that if you look

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:13.880 align:middle line:84%
at how scientists measure the
cycles per minute in the brain.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the beta state
is that is the lowest state

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.970 align:middle line:90%
that the brain can operate in.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:84%
It's also the state that
is not-- it's more robotic.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.200 align:middle line:90%
It seeks distraction.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:42.020 align:middle line:84%
The beta state is not
conductive to higher learning.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:45.090 align:middle line:84%
The beta state is the most
common state that all--

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mean the
13 to 18 hertz range?

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of where
we're running around

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:50.540 align:middle line:90%
and do our busy work.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So the beta state
is also the state

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:58.890 align:middle line:84%
that we can most
easily become ill.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:03.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the lowest functioning
state of the mind.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.830 align:middle line:90%
The majority of people operate--

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are in beta
most of the time.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: --are in
beta most of the time.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:09.903 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Second you wake up
to an alarm you're in beta.

00:23:09.903 --> 00:23:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes, yes.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:17.690 align:middle line:84%
So if we go-- let's say we're
at the lowest point now.

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:22.430 align:middle line:90%
Our goal is to exceed that.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Our goal is to
excel beyond that.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.750 align:middle line:84%
The way that we are going
to evolve, as a society,

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.700 align:middle line:90%
is not through technology.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.634 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: The way that
we are going to evolve,

00:23:34.634 --> 00:23:37.700 align:middle line:84%
as a society, is
through cultivating

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:42.080 align:middle line:84%
higher consciousness, through
cultivating higher frequencies.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.210 align:middle line:84%
When you cultivate
a higher frequency,

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:48.480 align:middle line:84%
it creates what's
called a frequency key.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.820 align:middle line:90%
What is a frequency?

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Well a frequency is energy.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.140 align:middle line:90%
And what is energy?

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Energy is information.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.830 align:middle line:90%
So this is how we evolve.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:04.460 align:middle line:84%
I wonder how many
people know that people

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.070 align:middle line:84%
like Henry Ford
and Thomas Edison

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.200 align:middle line:84%
had very little
formal schooling.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Neither graduated
from even high school.

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.790 align:middle line:90%
And so what does this tell us?

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:23.556 align:middle line:84%
This tells us-- where does
intelligence really come from?

00:24:23.556 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, well it
comes from that higher

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.330 align:middle line:90%
aspect of being.

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:28.430 align:middle line:84%
You can call it soul,
true self, whatever.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:29.560 align:middle line:90%
It's around us.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.920 align:middle line:90%
We're imbued with it.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.790 align:middle line:90%
But we can't reach.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And we can reach into it-- most
people cannot reach into it.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And these people
had this ability,

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:44.690 align:middle line:84%
this fluidity between those
fields, to freely tap in.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:48.784 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: See, I really
believe that we can reach it.

00:24:48.784 --> 00:24:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I believe we
can too, with practice.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And they've done-- the nice
thing about-- one thing

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:57.320 align:middle line:84%
about technology is the
notion of brain mapping,

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.320 align:middle line:84%
some of the advanced
neurofeedback devices,

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.050 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, because they
do reflect information.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And they've put monks
that have attained

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.250 align:middle line:84%
fairly high levels
of meditative status,

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.910 align:middle line:84%
and can move freely between the
soul and the conscious mind.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And these guys are operating at
50-55 hertz frequencies, right?

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Well actually--

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gamma range.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:25.190 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE: --the
slower the brain wave is,

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:26.436 align:middle line:10%
the higher the frequency.

00:25:26.436 --> 00:25:28.310 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, there's
the whole delta thing,

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.470 align:middle line:10%
going down into delta.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.180 align:middle line:10%
But there's also the
same thing going up,

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.980 align:middle line:10%
beyond beta, both ways.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:39.470 align:middle line:10%
They operate very proficiently
in gamma and all the way

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:43.800 align:middle line:10%
down into, of course, theta,
and then some in waking delta.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.544 align:middle line:90%
So we can do these things.

00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: We can.

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.260 align:middle line:10%
It's a--

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.310 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But we're just
stuck in that 13 to 18

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:52.400 align:middle line:10%
or 20 monkey mind thing.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.534 align:middle line:90%
It's a matter of cultivating it.

00:25:54.534 --> 00:25:55.333 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:55.333 --> 00:25:56.955 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: It's
not handed to us.

00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:57.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:25:57.755 --> 00:26:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: And this is
another aspect of free will.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:06.380 align:middle line:90%
We decide what we focus on.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.260 align:middle line:84%
We decide how we're
going to spend

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.730 align:middle line:90%
the dollars in our wallets.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:12.645 align:middle line:84%
We decide how we're
going to use our time.

00:26:12.645 --> 00:26:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And we decide how we're
going to use our minds.

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And it has everything to do
with how we use our minds.

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: So now
we've got it down.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:23.680 align:middle line:90%
We've got the body down.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.520 align:middle line:84%
We've got a billion-dollar
detox movement out there.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.900 align:middle line:90%
And god bless humanity.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.640 align:middle line:84%
They took the ball
and ran with it.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.700 align:middle line:90%
And good work.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And now it's time to
take the next step

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and recognize the
power of consciousness.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is the
most-- it's the greatest

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.795 align:middle line:90%
power in the universe.

00:26:45.795 --> 00:26:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:49.070 align:middle line:84%
It transcends everything
else on this plane.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It heals instantly.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:54.160 align:middle line:84%
It does-- it's the one
responsible for the miracles

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.030 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes.

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So this is another
reason it's so

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:03.320 align:middle line:84%
concerning that people
are being so encouraged

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.870 align:middle line:84%
to be distracted
by the technology

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:08.790 align:middle line:84%
and to have their heads buried
in these things all day long.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: These devices.

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:11.248 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: And
the young people

00:27:11.248 --> 00:27:13.370 align:middle line:84%
are being raised in
a way that is totally

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:17.250 align:middle line:84%
foreign to any other
generation in history,

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.457 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
human existence.

00:27:20.457 --> 00:27:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And we are causing this type
of damage to the human being,

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:28.300 align:middle line:84%
to our biofield, to
our brains, et cetera.

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.310 align:middle line:84%
But you have an
interesting story

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:33.260 align:middle line:84%
or two in the book about these
things aren't irreversible.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Because again, once you have
this consciousness that can

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:40.790 align:middle line:84%
start passing on through
your direct access to it--

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:42.460 align:middle line:84%
whether it's
meditation or what--

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.290 align:middle line:84%
passing on these
streams of information,

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:49.960 align:middle line:84%
you can heal even
some theoretically--

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.940 align:middle line:84%
some situations which
theoretically cannot be

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.775 align:middle line:84%
touched, you would think,
even with technology.

00:27:54.775 --> 00:27:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about healing
of the brain, for example,

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.540 align:middle line:84%
in one example you
use in the book.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:04.510 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes, so we were
of the understanding-- people

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:08.050 align:middle line:10%
who do healing work and
scientists-- that once

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:11.030 align:middle line:10%
the brain cells are destroyed,
that they can't be replaced,

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.420 align:middle line:10%
that they don't rejuvenate.

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was given a
very powerful example

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that yes, the brain does
have the ability to heal.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:90%
Through my work with iridology.

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:25.960 align:middle line:90%
I am a certified iridologist.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And I find the brain area
fascinating, and the eye.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.190 align:middle line:90%
The eye is set up like a clock.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So noon would be at the top,
which is the brain area.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.680 align:middle line:90%
Six o'clock would be the limbs.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And the right and the
left sides correlate

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:44.260 align:middle line:84%
with the right and left
sides of the organs.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a
fascinating tricky way--

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.317 align:middle line:84%
it's a non-invasive
way to look at what--

00:28:51.317 --> 00:28:53.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
beautiful, ancient science.

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: It is a
very, very useful science.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I had a-- I think
it was 2011, or 2014-- no,

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.940 align:middle line:90%
it was 2011.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.210 align:middle line:84%
A young man came to
me, about 19 years old.

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:10.880 align:middle line:84%
His father actually brought him
to me for an iridology reading.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Because he was having a
very difficult time working.

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:15.460 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't work.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.720 align:middle line:90%
He was very dizzy.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.030 align:middle line:90%
And he was very disoriented.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And he just wasn't
able to function.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And that, for a 19-year-old,
is very concerning.

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:27.910 align:middle line:84%
He's got his whole
life ahead of him.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:29.800 align:middle line:84%
I took a look in
the iris of the eye.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was so shocked
at what I saw.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.140 align:middle line:10%
I saw basically
what's called-- it's

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:40.840 align:middle line:10%
a degenerative black lacuna,
which is-- when it's black,

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.890 align:middle line:10%
that means that the material,
or the cellular structure

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:48.190 align:middle line:10%
of the tissue, is
very degenerated.

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:49.590 align:middle line:10%
It's basically non-functional.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:51.310 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: In what area?

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.550 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE: It was on the
right-hand-side of his brain,

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.690 align:middle line:10%
where he uses his cell phone.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:57.490 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:00.760 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE: And so I
tried to stay very calm.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.860 align:middle line:10%
And I gave him some
simple instructions.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And it involved
improving his nutrition,

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and only using his cell
phone for emergencies,

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and also not putting
it to his head.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Only on
speaker mode, yeah.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: On speaker mode.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And he was not happy
with my advice.

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:20.290 align:middle line:90%
But he followed.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And he came to see
me six months later.

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And I looked in the brain area
of the eye, of the lacuna.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:30.310 align:middle line:90%
And it had healing signs in it.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:33.082 align:middle line:90%
And I was euphoric.

00:30:33.082 --> 00:30:39.940 align:middle line:10%
It was one of the best moments
of my life, was the hope

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:43.550 align:middle line:10%
that-- and the proof
that-- if given a chance,

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:46.430 align:middle line:10%
that the brain can heal itself.

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:48.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And there
are other-- there

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:50.330 align:middle line:10%
are ancient technologies
in addition to his--

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:51.390 align:middle line:10%
he followed your advice.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:52.650 align:middle line:90%
He got the bad stuff away.

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.330 align:middle line:90%
But there are also little tools.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And this might seem
like a non sequitur,

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:58.260 align:middle line:90%
but I wanted to jump into it.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Because you wrote about it
in the book at this point.

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with a
substance called shungite.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that what
it's called, shungite?

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Shungite, yes.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about it.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: OK.

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:15.540 align:middle line:84%
We have these issues
with dissonant energy.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.080 align:middle line:84%
It seems like we can't get
away from it, at the moment.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.560 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
it can't change.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.760 align:middle line:90%
We created the problem.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.440 align:middle line:90%
We can solve the problems.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So until we can solve the
problem of the dissonant energy

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:36.014 align:middle line:84%
issue, we have to learn of
ways to protect ourselves.

00:31:36.014 --> 00:31:37.680 align:middle line:84%
This necklace that I
have on right now--

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I assume
that must be it.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: --is shungite.

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, shungite.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.329 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: It's a mineral.

00:31:41.329 --> 00:31:44.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a mineral that's
found, at the moment,

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:46.290 align:middle line:84%
at only one place
in the whole world,

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:51.330 align:middle line:84%
in the Karelia
section of Russia.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And shungite is
the only mineral--

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.890 align:middle line:84%
it was found to neutralize
electromagnetic frequencies.

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.410 align:middle line:84%
What it does-- it
has the ability

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:08.970 align:middle line:84%
to transform a left torsion
field to a right torsion field.

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So a left torsion
field-- a torsion field

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:17.700 align:middle line:84%
is a-- it's an
electromagnetic-- if you imagine

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:23.760 align:middle line:84%
the spiral of DNA, that's
what a torsion field is,

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.600 align:middle line:84%
with the change that
it is electromagnetic,

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.700 align:middle line:90%
rather than genetic.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:35.250 align:middle line:84%
A left torsion field is the
downward spiral of death.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:40.600 align:middle line:84%
It's the dehydrating
frequency of death.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.420 align:middle line:84%
That's what a left
torsion field is.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.650 align:middle line:84%
A right torsion field
is the upward spiral

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:50.100 align:middle line:84%
of higher frequency, the
higher frequency of life.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.320 align:middle line:84%
So shungite does
have the ability

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.130 align:middle line:84%
to neutralize it
and never pick up

00:32:56.130 --> 00:33:00.000 align:middle line:84%
the frequency of the
electromagnetic energetic

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.830 align:middle line:90%
frequencies.

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:01.800 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How was
this discovered?

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:04.240 align:middle line:90%
Who discovered this?

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to know
your own experience,

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.280 align:middle line:90%
now that you've been wearing it.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Well shungite
was discovered in Paris

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:15.450 align:middle line:84%
by a geobiologist
named Regina Martino.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:19.260 align:middle line:84%
She was given the
stone by, I believe,

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:26.610 align:middle line:84%
someone who was familiar with
the healing aspects of it.

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:27.750 align:middle line:90%
She was given the stone.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And many experiments
were done on it.

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And her book, "Shungite,"
is full of graphs,

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and full of information--
the scientific information

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:45.240 align:middle line:84%
that she did on shungite
to prove her work.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.790 align:middle line:90%
So I was fortunate.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt that
I was going to have

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.060 align:middle line:90%
to move out of San Francisco.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.580 align:middle line:90%
This was my home of 30 years.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:34:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was sent the book called
"Shungite" by Regina Martino,

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.472 align:middle line:90%
by my publisher.

00:34:01.472 --> 00:34:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: So
you see, here they're

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:05.850 align:middle line:90%
working with me on my book.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're sending
me the information

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:08.739 align:middle line:90%
that I need further.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:09.719 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From hers.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:10.677 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Exactly.

00:34:10.677 --> 00:34:12.163 align:middle line:84%
So you see how
life is reciprocal.

00:34:12.163 --> 00:34:13.199 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:15.726 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: And we
earn what we receive.

00:34:15.726 --> 00:34:17.850 align:middle line:84%
We receive the
information that we're

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:20.699 align:middle line:84%
supposed to receive, for
our work, for the work.

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So how did you feel?

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:26.130 align:middle line:84%
What did you experience once
you had this in your field?

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: I felt that
it helped me tremendously

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:36.659 align:middle line:84%
with the pain that I was feeling
in my actual brain, when they

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:39.150 align:middle line:90%
first turned on the signal.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:43.320 align:middle line:84%
They turned on a citywide
signal in San Francisco

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:48.570 align:middle line:90%
on New Year's Day of 2014.

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And they WiFi'd
Market Street, which

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:55.469 align:middle line:84%
is near to where my apartment
is, for several miles,

00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:56.910 align:middle line:90%
straight down to the water.

00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:57.615 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wow, I
didn't know about this.

00:34:57.615 --> 00:34:58.415 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes.

00:34:58.415 --> 00:35:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And when this happened,
I felt as though my aura

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.430 align:middle line:90%
was being shattered.

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And I began to-- I began to have
pain, real pain, in my brain,

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.790 align:middle line:90%
like I had never had before.

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And I also was having trouble
remembering my dreams.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:21.900 align:middle line:90%
I had a very active dream life.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And I began to
realize that I wasn't

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:32.160 align:middle line:84%
able to have that as a
tool, as fully in my life,

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.290 align:middle line:90%
as I did before.

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So all these things are
a process of experience,

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:43.599 align:middle line:84%
of learning, a cause and effect,
the effect behind the cause.

00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you're here.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.720 align:middle line:90%
You're going through.

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.396 align:middle line:84%
You feel like your
aura's shattered.

00:35:47.396 --> 00:35:48.395 align:middle line:90%
Your brain is shattered.

00:35:48.395 --> 00:35:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And you come in contact with
this through the publisher.

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:53.972 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:35:53.972 --> 00:35:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Oh,
after I read the book,

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.920 align:middle line:90%
I sought out the shungite.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And I did order shungite
from the author of the book

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.530 align:middle line:90%
in Paris.

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:11.194 align:middle line:84%
And so the healing
necklace came.

00:36:11.194 --> 00:36:12.610 align:middle line:84%
There was something
for my-- there

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:13.900 align:middle line:90%
was a disk for the cell phone.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.050 align:middle line:10%
There was a disk
for the computer.

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I was able
to balance out more with it.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:23.340 align:middle line:10%
And it helped with the pain.

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.680 align:middle line:90%
And that was good.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:31.300 align:middle line:10%
And I just felt that it also
helped me to-- at night,

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:35.610 align:middle line:10%
when I sleep, if I
can't get to sleep,

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:41.430 align:middle line:10%
because I feel like I have such
erratic energy around my head,

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:42.285 align:middle line:10%
from the WiFi--

00:36:42.285 --> 00:36:43.530 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: From the
WiFi and everything.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: --I
take the necklace

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:48.300 align:middle line:90%
and I put it right here.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.197 align:middle line:84%
And I fall asleep
in about 10 minutes.

00:36:50.197 --> 00:36:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's good.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.680 align:middle line:90%
So it really does seem to help.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: It
does seem to help.

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:58.420 align:middle line:10%
However, the signal
is increasing.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.670 align:middle line:84%
So as the signal
has increased, I've

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:04.800 align:middle line:84%
had to get more
shungite around my bed.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.460 align:middle line:90%
And I've had to arm up--

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: --suit up.

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:11.800 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.883 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To deal with it.

00:37:12.883 --> 00:37:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Thank god
we have these beautiful--

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And these technologies,
such as this and others,

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.930 align:middle line:84%
have-- they were known
in ancient times.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:24.340 align:middle line:84%
We didn't trash our
brain voluntarily

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:28.230 align:middle line:84%
and disrespect ourselves the
way we did, the way we do now.

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
example in your book

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:33.930 align:middle line:84%
that I found interesting, which
was a thawed out man, about

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:36.420 align:middle line:84%
5,000 years old, who
had been suspended,

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.130 align:middle line:84%
who had this tattoo
strategically placed.

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying
that that tattoo

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.030 align:middle line:90%
was for a very specific use.

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:44.910 align:middle line:84%
It was a type of
technology of the day.

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:45.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:52.060 align:middle line:84%
In the 5000-year-old--
I guess it was a mummy,

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:57.090 align:middle line:84%
the mummy named
Otzi-- he had tattoos

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:01.110 align:middle line:84%
over his arthritic joints,
the areas of his body

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:05.070 align:middle line:84%
where it was found that
his bones were arthritic.

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:12.130 align:middle line:10%
And this segues into the
science of BioGeometry

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:18.930 align:middle line:10%
that Dr. Ibrahim Karim of Egypt
has developed BioSignatures

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:27.670 align:middle line:10%
and ways of creating energy
frequencies with art and design

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:middle line:10%
work.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.480 align:middle line:10%
So these are other
ways that we can

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:37.770 align:middle line:10%
begin to incorporate healing
frequencies, to counter

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:40.020 align:middle line:10%
the dissonant frequencies.

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's imperative
that companies

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:47.400 align:middle line:90%
begin to apply these ways.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.830 align:middle line:90%
We can make technology safer.

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:54.670 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason why it
should be so destructive.

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:38:55.490 --> 00:39:00.130 align:middle line:84%
So now this sets us onto-- let's
go back to consciousness, away

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:02.750 align:middle line:90%
from these healing technologies.

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
statements you make

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:06.960 align:middle line:84%
in this book, which is
interesting-- you say,

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.420 align:middle line:84%
people have been misled to
create their own reality.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And from there we're going
to go into the processes,

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.820 align:middle line:84%
through the principles you
talk about-- universal mind,

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and so forth-- of coming
into connection with self.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's different for
everybody, of course.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:24.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, creating our
own reality is virtually

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.010 align:middle line:84%
a mantra in the
New Age community.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:31.680 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at your take on
creating one's own reality.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:35.380 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Well to look at
what's happening in the world

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.170 align:middle line:10%
right now, in regard to
creating your own reality,

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:44.070 align:middle line:10%
you have to take into account
the different types of ego

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:47.670 align:middle line:10%
that we work with.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:51.780 align:middle line:84%
In my work, I have
studied that there

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:55.110 align:middle line:84%
are the pure ego-- we
have the pure ego, which

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:58.410 align:middle line:84%
is the part of the ego
that knows that it exists.

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:01.020 align:middle line:10%
It's the pure consciousness.

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:08.320 align:middle line:84%
It's the part of the ego that
actually lives beyond the body.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: And then
you have the intellect.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.570 align:middle line:10%
The intellect functions
on a more linear level.

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And the intellect is
very closely connected

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:24.340 align:middle line:84%
with what's called the false
ego-- or the dispirited ego

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:27.440 align:middle line:84%
is probably a better
way to describe it.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:32.010 align:middle line:10%
So the dispirited or
false ego, we see,

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:40.390 align:middle line:10%
plays very much a part
of influencing people

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:44.320 align:middle line:10%
into believing that they
create their own "reality."

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:50.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, reality is created by
universal law, by natural law,

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:54.895 align:middle line:84%
by the invisible energies
that underpin existence.

00:40:54.895 --> 00:40:57.400 align:middle line:90%


00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:01.600 align:middle line:10%
We create our own
reality, either

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.480 align:middle line:10%
working-- there's two ways
to create your own reality.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.930 align:middle line:10%
You can either create
your own reality

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:12.940 align:middle line:10%
by connecting the intellect
with the soul, the higher

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.700 align:middle line:10%
self of the soul.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.900 align:middle line:10%
And you can create
your own reality

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:24.634 align:middle line:10%
by choosing to align with spirit
and do the work of spirit.

00:41:24.634 --> 00:41:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you create
your own reality by default

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.120 align:middle line:90%
by doing neither of the above.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Or you create your own
reality by really believing

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:35.770 align:middle line:84%
that you create your
own reality and not

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:43.390 align:middle line:84%
taking universal law, cosmic
mind into the equation,

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and believe that--
I'm going to give you

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:50.290 align:middle line:84%
a perfect example of what we're
doing right now with creating

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:52.340 align:middle line:90%
our own reality.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:55.840 align:middle line:10%
We are using the false ego
to create our own reality.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.300 align:middle line:90%
I was having lunch one day.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.880 align:middle line:84%
I overheard a lady
and a gentleman.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.490 align:middle line:10%
And she had just taken
one of these classes

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:05.260 align:middle line:10%
about creating your own reality.

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.440 align:middle line:10%
And she started talking
to her companion

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:13.570 align:middle line:10%
about how her uncle
had-- was so wealthy.

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:15.430 align:middle line:90%
And he was so old.

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:17.650 align:middle line:90%
And she was so poor.

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:21.130 align:middle line:10%
And her idea of
creating her own reality

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:23.530 align:middle line:10%
was to encourage
her uncle to pass

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:25.464 align:middle line:10%
so that she could have the--

00:42:25.464 --> 00:42:26.380 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Inheritance.

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.340 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE: --the
wealth, the inheritance.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:33.190 align:middle line:10%
And when I heard that, I
just thought, how awful.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:36.700 align:middle line:90%
What an awful reality is that?

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:39.513 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Because
you're creating

00:42:39.513 --> 00:42:41.710 align:middle line:10%
a frequency, a
dissonant frequency,

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:46.450 align:middle line:10%
not only for yourself, by
wishing that for yourself,

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:49.410 align:middle line:10%
but for wishing that
for someone else.

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly, yeah

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: And that that's
the simplest way that I can--

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's the lowest
aspect of egoic function.

00:42:56.770 --> 00:43:00.850 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes, and
so look, let's make sure

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:05.050 align:middle line:10%
that what we're saying, when
we say that we're creating

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:08.320 align:middle line:10%
our own reality, that
what we're saying

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:14.170 align:middle line:10%
is that we're not attempting
to override the higher

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:18.070 align:middle line:10%
intelligence that
underlies existence.

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So now let's get into
soul Breathing itself

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and some of the ways
in which-- let's

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:29.570 align:middle line:84%
start at really basic entry
points, where people can say,

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:30.370 align:middle line:90%
it's true.

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:33.610 align:middle line:84%
I really need to make a
conscious effort and practice

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:34.720 align:middle line:90%
of connecting to self.

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Because A, it can easily
perform miracles on your behalf.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:40.570 align:middle line:90%
They're not miracles.

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:42.320 align:middle line:84%
It's just doing what
it's already designed

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.840 align:middle line:90%
to do, without encumbrance.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes.

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And B, you can
have a much clearer idea

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:49.810 align:middle line:84%
of where your energies, and
talents, and skills should

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:54.010 align:middle line:84%
be placed, in any
given incarnation.

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:59.110 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE:
Yes, I mean when we

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:05.290 align:middle line:10%
are able to-- all the
advanced masters will tell you

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:11.440 align:middle line:10%
that it's not them that creates
the, quote, unquote, miracle.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:15.920 align:middle line:10%
It's the higher
aspect of the self.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.810 align:middle line:84%
It's the surrendering
of the self.

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To its
own higher aspect.

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes.

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:27.587 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a
humbling experience.

00:44:27.587 --> 00:44:32.536 align:middle line:90%


00:44:32.536 --> 00:44:36.490 align:middle line:10%
This is probably
the greatest gift

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:39.970 align:middle line:10%
that anyone could
be given in life,

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:48.520 align:middle line:10%
is to connect with this
deep, high master within.

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.530 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:57.070 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE: It exceeds
any monetary number

00:44:57.070 --> 00:45:03.700 align:middle line:10%
that we could place
upon any material item.

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:06.070 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:08.530 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE: And the
reason is because once you

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:16.030 align:middle line:10%
begin to resonate
with your soul self,

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:19.180 align:middle line:10%
money becomes
almost unnecessary.

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Because you're taken care of.

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:25.310 align:middle line:10%
You're carried.

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:28.350 align:middle line:10%
You're carried in a higher way.

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:31.050 align:middle line:10%


00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:38.880 align:middle line:10%
Things begin to become more
harmoniously patterned.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:43.680 align:middle line:10%
And the downward spiral
of depression and illness,

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:52.460 align:middle line:10%
confusion, war, destruction--
they don't enter

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:54.590 align:middle line:10%
into the equation anymore.

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:55.580 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:59.390 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Because
you're incapable-- addiction.

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Ah, when you reach
a certain frequency,

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.510 align:middle line:90%
you can't be addicted.

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:11.910 align:middle line:10%
You cannot get to a higher
frequency if you're addicted.

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:12.710 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:14.085 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE: It
doesn't allow--

00:46:14.085 --> 00:46:16.190 align:middle line:10%
it keeps you in a
certain frequency,

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:19.770 align:middle line:10%
and doesn't allow you to evolve.

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: To advance.

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there
are many forces that,

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:28.970 align:middle line:84%
whether it's intentional
or not, keep us

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:32.960 align:middle line:84%
from taking this step into
companionship with ourselves,

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.640 align:middle line:84%
not the least of which
are those charged

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.790 align:middle line:90%
with our spiritual development.

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:40.820 align:middle line:84%
I know that you, as
Barbara Hand Clow has

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:42.800 align:middle line:84%
done in her recent
work of fiction,

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.277 align:middle line:90%
do talk about the effects.

00:46:44.277 --> 00:46:45.110 align:middle line:90%
What do you call it?

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:46.700 align:middle line:90%
The sorcerers.

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:50.420 align:middle line:84%
The sorcerers out of the
Vatican and what they do

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:51.695 align:middle line:90%
in their planetary influence.

00:46:51.695 --> 00:46:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Barbara's written one
and is in the process

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:58.130 align:middle line:84%
of writing another book
about-- it's a work of fiction,

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:01.520 align:middle line:84%
but it's telling the
true facts and principles

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.850 align:middle line:84%
about what is going on in those
realms with the Vatican church

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and how it's expressing
in the world.

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Well it's
a very delicate subject

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:15.230 align:middle line:90%
for many people.

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:20.480 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE: But
I think that when

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:27.290 align:middle line:10%
you consider that there is no
other country in the world that

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:33.830 align:middle line:10%
doesn't have to pay
taxes, or is not audited,

00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:37.370 align:middle line:10%
you connect that with the
IRS, you see the connection,

00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:42.500 align:middle line:10%
you connect it with the banks,
you connect it with the world

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:46.340 align:middle line:10%
financial systems that
we have in place now,

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:52.190 align:middle line:10%
and you just begin to realize
that there's something

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:54.310 align:middle line:10%
not quite right about it!

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:56.220 --> 00:48:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: And so
it's OK to recognize

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:04.796 align:middle line:90%
that you're being bamboozled.

00:48:04.796 --> 00:48:07.310 align:middle line:90%


00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:12.920 align:middle line:10%
And the illusion of
what has been created

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:20.780 align:middle line:10%
through the centuries have
basically-- it's a form of mind

00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:24.560 align:middle line:10%
control, is what it is.

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the people
who insist that religion is

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:33.350 align:middle line:84%
hallowed ground, that
it cannot be questioned,

00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:43.040 align:middle line:84%
that it cannot be talked
about in a way that is honest.

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:48.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not acceptable to do it.

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And so when you begin
to understand more,

00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:52.940 align:middle line:90%
you become more conscious.

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:56.120 align:middle line:84%
You begin to recognize and
you begin to see everything

00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.700 align:middle line:90%
for exactly what it is.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And I really feel
that people are

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:07.290 align:middle line:84%
being led away from the
inner religious experience--

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I believe so.

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: --the spontaneous
experience that it is.

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:17.870 align:middle line:90%
Each journey is unique.

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And there shouldn't be anyone
who interferes with that.

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:29.150 align:middle line:84%
There are no intermediaries
between you and your soul.

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely not.

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And yet everything
seems to intervene.

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So, let's-- or interfere--
more so interfere.

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So let's take our remaining
time and talk about some

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:42.230 align:middle line:84%
of the ways in which
you suggest to people

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:45.300 align:middle line:90%
they can begin this process.

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:50.330 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Well when you
consider the fact that most

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:58.430 align:middle line:10%
people spend more time with
self-maintenance, let's say,

00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:02.330 align:middle line:10%
than they do on cultivating
their connection

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:06.290 align:middle line:10%
to their own soul, or
they spend much more time

00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:07.850 align:middle line:10%
watching television,
or maybe they

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:11.510 align:middle line:10%
spend much more time
on their iPhone,

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:16.170 align:middle line:10%
we can see right now that
we have a lot of work to do.

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:19.280 align:middle line:10%
We have to shift our focus.

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:23.060 align:middle line:10%
If we're going to pull the
bow up out of the water

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:28.100 align:middle line:10%
and save the ship, we have
to alter what we're creating.

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:32.600 align:middle line:10%
We have to recognize that
we have a lot more to learn

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:37.700 align:middle line:10%
about the invisible energies
that support life, that

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:41.830 align:middle line:10%
are being severely affected
by what we're creating.

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:44.570 align:middle line:90%


00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:47.930 align:middle line:10%
And I think if people
really understood

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:53.270 align:middle line:10%
how energy worked,
how frequency works,

00:50:53.270 --> 00:51:03.140 align:middle line:10%
how we have the ability to
go beyond every problem that

00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:07.810 align:middle line:10%
has been presented
to us on the planet--

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:10.840 align:middle line:10%
if they understood
the value of it,

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:14.980 align:middle line:10%
I think maybe people might
recognize how important it

00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:20.800 align:middle line:10%
is to cultivate self-mastery.

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And again,
I think your book

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.810 align:middle line:84%
makes a very good argument
for the need to do that.

00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:26.980 align:middle line:90%
We absolutely must do that.

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:29.890 align:middle line:84%
That is the salvation
of the beauty,

00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and potential future beauty,
of life on Earth, period.

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:32.930 align:middle line:90%
There isn't anything else.

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: That's
our only way out.

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the only way
out of this consciousness.

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: That's
our only way through.

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:36.435 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:51:36.435 --> 00:51:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Every advanced
master has always taught

00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:41.810 align:middle line:90%
self-mastery--

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:45.459 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: --never that
you go-- you're never between--

00:51:45.459 --> 00:51:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Never
turning to externals.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: --turning
to external ways,

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:52.910 align:middle line:84%
never turning to a priest, or
a guru, or a supposed master.

00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:56.290 align:middle line:10%
Someone who calls him
or herself a master

00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:58.780 align:middle line:10%
would never do that
if they understood

00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:00.640 align:middle line:10%
what self-mastery really was.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Self-mastery is
what Jesus taught.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:09.580 align:middle line:84%
That's why he was
taken off the planet.

00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:17.370 align:middle line:10%
He was dealt with by the
dispirited and the false ego

00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:22.720 align:middle line:10%
in its most dangerous
and sad form.

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So when you come
to planet Earth,

00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:29.390 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to
teach self-mastery,

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:33.970 align:middle line:84%
what you're really teaching
is self-empowerment.

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't need
any middle men or women.

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Well, look.

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:44.770 align:middle line:84%
We see by simply looking at
the culture, the world culture,

00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:46.840 align:middle line:84%
they are not
interested in helping

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.320 align:middle line:90%
people find their power.

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.161 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: They would
rather remain in power.

00:52:51.161 --> 00:52:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:53.350 align:middle line:90%
And so it's up to us.

00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:55.120 align:middle line:90%
It's up to authors like you.

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.910 align:middle line:84%
It's up to all people
who are choosing

00:52:57.910 --> 00:53:03.140 align:middle line:84%
to put the message that this
journey has dire consequences.

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:05.195 align:middle line:84%
To not take this journey
has dire consequences.

00:53:05.195 --> 00:53:08.260 align:middle line:90%


00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And I like the
fact that you spend

00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:12.080 align:middle line:84%
the bulk of your book
really looking at-- you

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:14.020 align:middle line:90%
do have exercises in there.

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:17.680 align:middle line:84%
But in truth, there are many,
many different ways for one

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.910 align:middle line:90%
to find their path, right?

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes, and
it's a personal path.

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:28.330 align:middle line:10%
No one can really tell you
how to find self-mastery.

00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:32.020 align:middle line:10%
Self-mastery is
whole brain thinking.

00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:33.070 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:35.500 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE: And
if you understand

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:42.610 align:middle line:10%
that your intellect is linear,
your soul or your higher self

00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:46.840 align:middle line:10%
is non-linear, the
two work together,

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:55.000 align:middle line:10%
every great power in the
universe has polarity to it.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:01.090 align:middle line:10%
Polarities are meant to
work together, in harmony.

00:54:01.090 --> 00:54:02.807 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:54:02.807 --> 00:54:04.390 align:middle line:84%
They're not meant
to fight each other.

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes.

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Polarity's different
than polarization, absolutely.

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: So without
polarity, life would not exist.

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Male, female-- there would be
nothing within the universe.

00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: So let's
imagine that we're only

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:20.350 align:middle line:90%
working with the intellect.

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:22.300 align:middle line:90%
That's a partial equation.

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:25.926 align:middle line:84%
We're working with
a partial equation.

00:54:25.926 --> 00:54:29.050 align:middle line:84%
We want to create
a whole equation

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:31.160 align:middle line:90%
of balance and harmony.

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:35.860 align:middle line:84%
The way that that's done
is whole brain thinking.

00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's the path
to self-mastery.

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, any
which way a person can find it.

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:47.390 align:middle line:84%
But number one, it seems to me
it always starts in one place.

00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Just like when you read your
book, the points you make,

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and arguments you
make for this needing

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:57.160 align:middle line:84%
to be our top priority now, for
one-- top priority especially

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.960 align:middle line:84%
in the education
of young children

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:03.140 align:middle line:84%
by family, by-- even there are
some systems that might even

00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:06.680 align:middle line:84%
create that, but
mostly by family--

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:10.700 align:middle line:84%
is that we start
in simple places.

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:13.060 align:middle line:84%
There are very simple
places to begin.

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:14.680 align:middle line:90%
A, choice.

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:15.700 align:middle line:90%
We're making a choice--

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Free will.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, we're
using our free will.

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And will has meaning
to make a choice

00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:23.230 align:middle line:84%
that this is our path
now, and that we're

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:27.760 align:middle line:84%
going to spend some time each
day in reading one of the 1,000

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:30.550 align:middle line:84%
books toward
self-mastery, right--

00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:32.180 align:middle line:90%
some better than others.

00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Or by simply honoring
simple principles inside,

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:39.050 align:middle line:84%
like maybe start
with just compassion.

00:55:39.050 --> 00:55:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes.

00:55:39.850 --> 00:55:42.155 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Simple things--
beauty, generosity, peace.

00:55:42.155 --> 00:55:43.863 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes,
the fruits of spirit.

00:55:43.863 --> 00:55:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>L'ESPERANCE: I'll tell
you a quick little story.

00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes?

00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:49.041 align:middle line:10%
>>L'ESPERANCE: I recently
explained to a friend of mine

00:55:49.041 --> 00:55:56.470 align:middle line:10%
how I found the healing
retreat that I do work at.

00:55:56.470 --> 00:56:02.180 align:middle line:10%
And it is that a lavender
and white colored dragonfly

00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:05.680 align:middle line:10%
appeared in the window
of a realtor's office.

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And I would have never
gone in had it not

00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:08.790 align:middle line:90%
been for that dragonfly.

00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Because it was a hot summer day.

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said to myself,
that dragonfly is going

00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:16.990 align:middle line:90%
to die if I don't get it out.

00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:19.360 align:middle line:90%
I went inside.

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:21.430 align:middle line:10%
I would have never gone.

00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I told that story
to my friend, he said,

00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.960 align:middle line:90%
I have to be more open.

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:34.150 align:middle line:10%
I have to be more open to
these little, subtle, spiritual

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:37.700 align:middle line:10%
signals in my life.

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:40.917 align:middle line:84%
And you know, sometimes that's
all it is, is just opening--

00:56:40.917 --> 00:56:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is just that, exactly.

intelligent teacher.

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:56:55.300 --> 00:57:00.029 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's the dragonfly
experience that gives you--

00:57:00.029 --> 00:57:02.320 align:middle line:84%
and what comes from that--
that gives that little point

00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.392 align:middle line:90%
of validation.

00:57:03.392 --> 00:57:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And if people are
paying attention,

00:57:04.850 --> 00:57:07.430 align:middle line:84%
they'll start seeing that
there's validation everywhere.

00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>>L'ESPERANCE: Yes.

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we, as a
species, need that reassurance.

00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:11.600 align:middle line:90%
We need validation.

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.060 align:middle line:90%
But the point is, it's around.

00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:17.680 align:middle line:84%

just step on the path.
