>>REGINA MEREDITH: The notion
of any absolute good and evil

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.540 align:middle line:10%
seems to become an archaic
thought in a world driven

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.550 align:middle line:10%
by preference and relativism.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.780 align:middle line:90%
But is it?

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Hermeticist and modern day
philosopher Neil Kramer

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.080 align:middle line:90%
is back with us.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
talk about the basics,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.240 align:middle line:84%
the nature of good and
evil, right and wrong.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
unpopular because it's

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.060 align:middle line:90%
an anything-goes world.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.860 align:middle line:90%
And we know that.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:84%
We've seen this through a
lot of phenomena going on

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.130 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has their own notion
of what reality is now,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.270 align:middle line:84%
where we used to have more
kind of consensus reality.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:84%
One can argue whether that's
a good thing or a bad thing.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.180 align:middle line:84%
But I think we need to go
even deeper into the basics.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So Neil, thank you for gracing
us with your presence again.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:90%
And let's start with reality.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.310 align:middle line:90%
What does reality even mean?

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.730 align:middle line:90%
And what is reality to you?

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NEIL KRAMER: Reality is what
is real, and only what is real.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.880 align:middle line:10%
It's not a personal creation.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not your interface.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.140 align:middle line:90%
It's the world.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Reality is the
world that is real.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.600 align:middle line:84%
It reveals itself only
to those who seek it.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle line:84%
So I would say most people
that we meet in our lives, most

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.500 align:middle line:84%
people we cross in
the street, most

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.580 align:middle line:84%
people in spiritual communities
and in materialist communities

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.250 align:middle line:90%
don't know what reality is.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:84%
They move in it, but
they don't see it.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So it only reveals
itself to those

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.760 align:middle line:84%
who pursue it because it is an
inherently supernatural thing.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.900 align:middle line:90%
It's material aspect.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:90%
It's slight.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.503 align:middle line:84%
It's real nature
is supernatural,

00:01:54.503 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:84%
which is why most
people don't pursue it

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.510 align:middle line:90%
because it is a divine thing.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.467 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't
accept that, it's

00:02:00.467 --> 00:02:02.050 align:middle line:84%
going to limit you
from the beginning.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:84%
So the pursuit of
truth will lead you

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.820 align:middle line:84%
to reality over a
century, over 100 years.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to see it
fully until you're 60, 70, 80.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that, you're
going to see a little bit.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Reality is the real
world and nothing else.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:90%
And it's one thing.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.335 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same for everybody.

00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it sounds
like what you're

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.030 align:middle line:84%
saying is to see
reality, we have

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:84%
to see the unseen building
blocks and constructs that

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.895 align:middle line:90%
actually make reality.

00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: You have to
see what is real first.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.270 align:middle line:90%
You have to see the trees.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.220 align:middle line:84%
You have to see the
mountains and rivers.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By the five
sense world real.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Sure.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.170 align:middle line:84%
So you have to understand first,
the natural creation is here.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:84%
How real it is is a
slightly different question.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.830 align:middle line:90%
But it's here.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And it symbolizes and
typifies what is actual.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
beginning place which

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.530 align:middle line:84%
is why it's very smart and wise
to draw young minds and hearts

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.990 align:middle line:90%
to nature and education.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.200 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at nature,
because that's going to tell us

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:90%
something that's real.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the city,
the suburban life,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:84%
the mainstream culture
is not going to do that.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.190 align:middle line:84%
It's going to lead you
away from what is real.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.350 align:middle line:90%
Nature symbolizes reality.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Nature shows us something
toward the creator.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:84%
That's a starting point,
is to examine its presence.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:84%
As to the purpose
and nature of that,

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.330 align:middle line:90%
that's a different question.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.922 align:middle line:84%
And we can get into
that whenever you like.

00:03:31.922 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle line:84%
But let's go to the
next part first,

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.130 align:middle line:84%
which is the new
age nostrum that we

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.470 align:middle line:90%
can create our own reality.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah, garbage.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.845 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
is essentially

00:03:39.845 --> 00:03:41.630 align:middle line:90%
where everybody's living.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.770 align:middle line:90%
We're all in our own movie.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's very
hard to move anything

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:84%
of a coherent and
constructive nature forward

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.670 align:middle line:84%
when you can't get anyone
in the same place thinking

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.230 align:middle line:84%
in a similar way at the same
time, perceiving reality

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.030 align:middle line:90%
the same way.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, if reality
is only what is real,

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.320 align:middle line:84%
then that makes us all in a
quite inequitable place, which

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.110 align:middle line:84%
is to say, it's a
level playing field.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.405 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has the same
access to reality.

00:04:07.405 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:84%
If you're born,
and you're alive,

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.780 align:middle line:90%
and you can think and feel--

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.430 align:middle line:90%
which most people can--

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:84%
you have total
access to reality.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And the truth of that
reality is available.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a really strange thing to
say that truth is available.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Today, unlike any other
period in human history

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:84%
that I can think of,
the truth is there

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.830 align:middle line:84%
to find in any walk of life--
political, social, cultural,

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.370 align:middle line:84%
artistic, spiritual,
physiological, nutritional--

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.030 align:middle line:84%
whatever you care to think
of, truth is available.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And if people want that
truth, they can go to it.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And you have to develop
a field of expertise.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:84%
You can't know
all truth, but you

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.600 align:middle line:84%
can focus on the things
that are most important.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
want the truth.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:84%
What they want is
to settle instead

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.987 align:middle line:90%
for a very satisfying fantasy.

00:04:57.987 --> 00:05:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, like a
reflection of their desires

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.940 align:middle line:90%
being manifest.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So they'll say, well,
I'm glad you've got

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.730 align:middle line:90%
your reality and your truth.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's cool, because I've
got my reality and my truth.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.990 align:middle line:84%
That's the sign of a fantasist
who has found not truth,

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.570 align:middle line:84%
but a very comfortable
delusional state in which they

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:90%
can dwell.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Now some people, I have to
say, do that rather pleasingly

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.207 align:middle line:90%
and rather harmlessly.

00:05:21.207 --> 00:05:22.290 align:middle line:90%
And some of those people--

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.665 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's none
of my business.

00:05:23.665 --> 00:05:26.760 align:middle line:84%
If they want to do that, they
can do that all day long.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Many people, though, do
that in a harmful way

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.440 align:middle line:84%
where it's actually
damaging and destructive.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.273 align:middle line:84%
So their delusion has
lots of conditions.

00:05:35.273 --> 00:05:36.190 align:middle line:90%
And those conditions--

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.773 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the damage,

00:05:37.773 --> 00:05:41.130 align:middle line:84%
that that kind of mindset
of creating reality is.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Well, if you're
protecting a fantasy,

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.068 align:middle line:84%
you don't want it
interfered with.

00:05:45.068 --> 00:05:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like your
reality happy bubble

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.400 align:middle line:84%
place and all the
accouterments and phenomena

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.350 align:middle line:90%
that associate with that.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:84%
You have to defend it
because it's vulnerable,

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:90%
because it's unreal.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And one of those things
is don't offend me.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So don't
offend me in my bubble

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.210 align:middle line:84%
because your offense is an
existential threat to my life.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Because if my belief
systems collapse--

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.450 align:middle line:84%
however pleasing and
pleasant, and apparently sort

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.760 align:middle line:90%
of humane in modern era--

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.380 align:middle line:84%
then I'm in a
difficult position.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's most people's
opposition to the truth,

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:84%
is that it actually interferes
with their spiritual

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.170 align:middle line:90%
and material delusions.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.400 align:middle line:90%
So they don't want the truth.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.410 align:middle line:90%
They want fantasy.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Most people I ever see anywhere
in the world in all walks

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.320 align:middle line:90%
of life, they want fantasy.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.340 align:middle line:90%
That's what people want.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.960 align:middle line:90%
They settle for a fantasy.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
that is largely true.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's like I said in
the open of the show,

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.540 align:middle line:90%
it's an archaic thought.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Hermetics themselves
are archaic in a sense,

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.520 align:middle line:84%
because they strip you down
to the basic nature of reality

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.000 align:middle line:84%
in so many ways, where
people are being encouraged

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.400 align:middle line:84%
through modern
life to go anywhere

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:84%
except to the discovery of where
the nature of reality truly is.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
preference-driven world.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah, it is.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
in my early life,

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.590 align:middle line:84%
I was interested
in esoteric study--

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.510 align:middle line:90%
hermetism, rosicrucianism--

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, all of it.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --occultic
practices, lots of things.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:84%
But all the time behind
that was Christianity.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a hermetist, you're
dealing with Christianity.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned from my
esoteric Christian studies is

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.760 align:middle line:84%
there's an enormous
difference between real,

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.020 align:middle line:84%
pure Christian practice--
which is super jedi hard core

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.820 align:middle line:90%
excellence--

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mystical.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --and the institution
of the church, which

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.422 align:middle line:84%
is almost nothing to
do with Christianity.

00:07:41.422 --> 00:07:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Worlds apart, yeah.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So 2.4, 2.5
billion Christians--

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.080 align:middle line:84%
I would say-- sadly,
don't really know

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.510 align:middle line:84%
what true Christian
practice is because it's

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.220 align:middle line:90%
hard to understand.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.140 align:middle line:84%
I've studied the Bible
for 30 years now.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say I'm just
understanding it

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:90%
now because it is coded.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:05.552 align:middle line:84%
It's not meant to be open in
its deeper layers to everyone.

00:08:05.552 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And some Bible scholars
I know personally

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.960 align:middle line:90%
would disagree with me on that.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a book written
for every man, every woman.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.240 align:middle line:90%
I see that.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.660 align:middle line:84%
It is true in this
parable and moral fiber.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And a compass of righteous
behavior, good virtue,

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.570 align:middle line:90%
integrity, no question.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.400 align:middle line:90%
But the deeper layers of it--

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:29.340 align:middle line:84%
prophecy, knowing divinity,
birth, death, afterlife--

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.600 align:middle line:84%
the supernatural presence of
evil and good in the world

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:39.809 align:middle line:84%
is unparalleled in its
potency and its profundity.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's not visible
to the average reader.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.952 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have to
have maturity, knowledge.

00:08:44.952 --> 00:08:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: You have
to have maturity

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.360 align:middle line:84%
in your own experiential
life, but you also

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.010 align:middle line:90%
need instruction as well.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.905 align:middle line:84%
Without Bible
scholarship instruction,

00:08:52.905 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether
I'd have ever understood

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.610 align:middle line:90%
what it was actually saying.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And that opens up part of our
discussion about absolutism

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.640 align:middle line:90%
and relativism.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the big
threats to empire society

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.170 align:middle line:84%
today-- empire being
this system of control.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And it totally rules
mainstream life.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.900 align:middle line:90%
A threat to that is absolutism.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And the absolutism of
something like Christianity

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:23.110 align:middle line:84%
is a danger to
mainstream culture.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And it is a danger because
it pulls it to pieces.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.677 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or, not
to the religion,

00:09:26.677 --> 00:09:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Christianity, but to the actual
mystical meaning and practice

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.060 align:middle line:90%
behind it.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: True Christianity.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: True, true esoteric
Christianity is Christianity.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: The church stuff
is a contamination of it.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.637 align:middle line:84%
So actual Christianity is
mystical esoteric Christianity.

00:09:41.637 --> 00:09:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.100 align:middle line:90%
I hear you on that.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's go back to
reality for one more moment.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.120 align:middle line:84%
The five sense world,
a lot of people say,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.550 align:middle line:90%
forget the five sense world.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Really, it's just a
construct of the mind.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.010 align:middle line:90%
But you can touch a tree.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.010 align:middle line:84%
These are agreed-upon
realities if you're

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.260 align:middle line:90%
going to live on Earth, right?

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Yeah, they are
here for important purpose.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're here
for-- so let's talk

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.050 align:middle line:84%
about the meaning behind the
construct of Earth's reality,

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.880 align:middle line:84%
our five sense
tangible, sensual world

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle line:84%
which everything
is produced from.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Sure.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you were
a teacher teaching

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.200 align:middle line:90%
real esoteric spiritual lore--

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.580 align:middle line:84%
L-O-R-E-- and life, you
would take newcomers--

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:84%
whether they're
children, or whether

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.150 align:middle line:84%
they're in the 50's or
60's, it doesn't matter.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.730 align:middle line:84%
You would take them into
the natural landscape.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And you would say, nature
shows us God's imagination.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.330 align:middle line:90%
And it shows us it in two ways.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.960 align:middle line:84%
The first way is
that nature shows us

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.320 align:middle line:90%
incredible unparalleled beauty.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.678 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: I could name so many
things, especially living in--

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's a
virtue worth living for.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It it.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Beauty makes life
worth it often.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.522 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And when everything
else is broken and fallen

00:10:55.522 --> 00:10:58.390 align:middle line:84%
to pieces, as happens in
life, beauty is there.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.000 align:middle line:84%
So I take myself at
bad times in life

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.270 align:middle line:84%
to the mountains, the rivers,
the meadows, the pastures,

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.070 align:middle line:90%
the forests, the deserts.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.690 align:middle line:90%
And I see incredible beauty.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.160 align:middle line:90%
I see harmony.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.300 align:middle line:90%
I see elegance.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.190 align:middle line:90%
I see love.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:16.120 align:middle line:84%
I see this enormous
ecology of life

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.140 align:middle line:84%
where everything is finding
equilibrium and a sense

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:90%
of goodness together.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: That's
on the one hand.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a flip side to that,
which is nature also shows

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.260 align:middle line:90%
us it is savage.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:90%
It is hostile.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.800 align:middle line:90%
It is parasitic.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And it cares nothing
for human life, nothing.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:40.330 align:middle line:84%
So if I go and hike in my
Olympic National Forest,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.100 align:middle line:84%
a cougar will come
and rip my throat out.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm dead in a gully for two
weeks until somebody finds--

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's not personal.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It's not personal.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.260 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't know who I am.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.450 align:middle line:90%
It's not disagreeing with me.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:54.740 align:middle line:84%
It's just the hostile
nature of this landscape.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:90%
So nature shows you two things.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.170 align:middle line:84%
One is harmony, and
one is disharmony.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And the esoteric teaching in
that that nature reveals--

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and this is a big thing to
say, but I'm happy to say it--

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.620 align:middle line:84%
what that shows us is that this
is not our natural environment.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.020 align:middle line:90%
This world is not our home.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.228 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
where the soul resides.

00:12:16.228 --> 00:12:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: It's not our home
in any way, shape, or form.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Soul is not here, although
the vessel of soul is here.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.070 align:middle line:90%
But what fills it?

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Spirit is not here.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.230 align:middle line:90%
So our original home is gone.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a world of
teaching which is finite.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.230 align:middle line:90%
And then a new world comes.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.200 align:middle line:84%
This world is meant
to be disharmonious.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Nature shows us that.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.890 align:middle line:84%
So this finiteness of this world
and the inherent brokenness

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.840 align:middle line:90%
of it is the teaching mechanism.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.250 align:middle line:90%
Polarization.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Good, evil, right,
wrong, broken, whole.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:50.950 align:middle line:84%
That's the tough
thing in reality

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:56.650 align:middle line:84%
that you have to realize as
Christ did, as Buddha did.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Christ says this world is
broken, but it's teaching.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Buddha says this world is
suffering, but it's teaching.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Don't try and pretend
it's not suffering.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Don't seek for a truth that's
like a bomb or a medicine

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:90%
or a bandage for your suffering.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Understand that your suffering
will purify you and show you

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.880 align:middle line:90%
truth.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.640 align:middle line:84%
So you're changing
your relationship

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.260 align:middle line:84%
with the pain of
reality to suffer less.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.750 align:middle line:90%
So you purify, you suffer less.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Now that is a tough teaching
that most people in this day

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.300 align:middle line:90%
don't want to suffer at all.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.612 align:middle line:84%
They'll do anything
to avoid suffering.

00:13:33.612 --> 00:13:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, indeed.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And we have every single
distraction in the world

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.600 align:middle line:90%
to help us avoid it.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: A million.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.682 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
notion of suffering

00:13:39.682 --> 00:13:41.103 align:middle line:90%
also has to do with attachment.

00:13:41.103 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And once we attach
to whether it's

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.830 align:middle line:84%
an idea, a person,
a thing, or whatnot,

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and that is being
removed from our reality,

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:51.560 align:middle line:84%
that tends to create a lot
of what we call suffering.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Indeed.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And that, again, is a great
Hindu and Christian principle

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:02.290 align:middle line:84%
shared well between those two
ways of perceiving reality.

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.830 align:middle line:84%
For me, what my
Christian upbringing

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:84%
showed me is that if
you attach yourself

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.840 align:middle line:84%
to anything in this world,
you've made a big mistake.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Because this world--
as Paul told us,

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:16.210 align:middle line:84%
as Christ told us, as Peter
told us-- is passing away.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So to invest in this
would be foolish.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Emotionally, mentally,
financially, materially, it

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.230 align:middle line:90%
would be foolish.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, its
presence is important.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a teaching mechanism.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Its illusionary
nature is irrelevant.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.665 align:middle line:90%
Its presence is what counts.

00:14:31.665 --> 00:14:36.160 align:middle line:84%
So to cast this off as
Maya, illusion, samsara,

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.260 align:middle line:90%
is an error in my view.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
it's an error as well.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: I think that
would be a mistake.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
our learning ground.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.628 align:middle line:84%
It's our school
and our playground.

00:14:42.628 --> 00:14:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And to
live in a body that

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.980 align:middle line:84%
is dying as soon as it
is born is incredible.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.880 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
teaching mechanism.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:84%
So the very mortality of a
human being, 100 years of life--

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.220 align:middle line:90%
a little less, a little more--

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.280 align:middle line:90%
are not set.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, you wake
up and your body's changing.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.110 align:middle line:90%
Your form changes.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.250 align:middle line:90%
You have illness.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.360 align:middle line:90%
You have disease.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.060 align:middle line:90%
You have pain, sorrow.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:07.990 align:middle line:90%
People are born.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.100 align:middle line:90%
People die.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.360 align:middle line:90%
People come into our lives.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.110 align:middle line:90%
People go out of our lives.

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.780 align:middle line:90%
This is the teaching.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.570 align:middle line:84%
None of these things are
separate from spiritual life.

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:17.720 align:middle line:90%
They are spiritual life.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So the
physical reality

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.080 align:middle line:84%
is what we're being
asked to look at.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Now the spiritual
reality is there too.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's the physical
reality is forcing you

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.760 align:middle line:90%
to embody your spiritual truth.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.800 align:middle line:84%
If it's not
embodied, if it's not

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:84%
every day in your home-- in
the kitchen, in the workplace,

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.370 align:middle line:84%
in the supermarket--
then it's not real.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.052 align:middle line:84%
So the physical compels you
to deal with what is real.

00:15:44.052 --> 00:15:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I couldn't
agree with you more.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.670 align:middle line:84%
It's engaging with life in
the five sensory world--

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Embracing
the whole thing.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --where the
lessons are all of it.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yes.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.772 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let
me ask you about this.

00:15:52.772 --> 00:15:55.180 align:middle line:84%
This is another overlay,
an esoteric one.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And Tom Campbell's work,
"My Big TOE", right?

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:84%
The way he describes
reality as we experience

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:05.890 align:middle line:84%
is a collectively
rendered reality.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Because the people who
are incarnating here

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.600 align:middle line:84%
on this planet,
at this time, have

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.490 align:middle line:84%
chosen to have this playground
as our collective experience--

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:18.220 align:middle line:84%
even if the tree is
no more a tree than it

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:84%
is a shoe, if you just look
at it from a quantum physics

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:21.850 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:26.080 align:middle line:84%
So somehow we have all agreed
to play in this together.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: I see that
a little differently.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:29.090 align:middle line:90%
I love Tom Campbell, by the way.

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:29.890 align:middle line:90%
He totally rocks.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.540 align:middle line:84%
But I see it differently
to him on this one.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.610 align:middle line:90%
This is a made world.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.100 align:middle line:84%
It was designed and we
had nothing to do with it.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.742 align:middle line:90%
So I don't see that in that way.

00:16:38.742 --> 00:16:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
mean, it is interesting

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.610 align:middle line:84%
because that would
denote that we've

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:44.330 align:middle line:90%
created the world around us.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: We haven't.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.238 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: In my life, I
see no evidence for that.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.280 align:middle line:90%
I go to my sources of wisdom--

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:57.180 align:middle line:84%
me, God, wise men and women
I know, spiritual literature.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And none of those things
corroborate that for me.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: The way I feel now is
that this world was agreed upon

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.930 align:middle line:90%
to be in by our ancestors--

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.978 align:middle line:84%
so the original man,
the original woman.

00:17:10.978 --> 00:17:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And again, you see
this in hermetism.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:90%
You see it in Christianity.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.630 align:middle line:84%
You see it in many
other systems.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors made the decision
to know the wisdom of God,

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:27.220 align:middle line:84%
to know the discriminating
power of good and evil,

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.660 align:middle line:90%
to know those things.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.990 align:middle line:84%
We, therefore-- through
heritage and their endowment--

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.600 align:middle line:84%
have come here to
complete that project.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.330 align:middle line:84%
To know good and evil, to know
right and wrong, to know truth

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and falsehood in this
world that is expertly

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.610 align:middle line:90%
made as a classroom--

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:90%
to compel that to happen.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.130 align:middle line:90%
And the bad guys--

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.670 align:middle line:84%
again, supernatural origin,
but the human administrators

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:50.470 align:middle line:90%
of that--

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.345 align:middle line:84%
all they have to do is persuade
you that that's all garbage.

00:17:54.345 --> 00:17:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And if that's what
you should do,

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.930 align:middle line:84%
is look after your own comfort
and security and entertainment,

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.200 align:middle line:90%
there is nothing to discern.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.900 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to discriminate.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Good and evil is an
old-fashioned idea.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.207 align:middle line:90%
And frankly, it's gone away.

00:18:05.207 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's subjective.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: They would
love you to think that.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And as
soon as that happens,

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.620 align:middle line:90%
you are de-spiritualizing.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Because truth, goodness,
beauty, rightness

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.470 align:middle line:84%
are absolute, totally absolute--
one thing for everyone,

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:21.545 align:middle line:90%
no exceptions.

00:18:21.545 --> 00:18:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I happen to
agree with you on that.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And just recently,
even in my own work

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:84%
with my own little
merry band of patrons--

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:31.240 align:middle line:84%
right-- I started bringing
up the notion that it's time

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.990 align:middle line:84%
to start really going into
reflections of what the true

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:38.850 align:middle line:84%
virtues are and mean-- how
we embody them, how we don't.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And start really diving
deep into the great virtues

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think
we can find our way back

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.800 align:middle line:84%
even to the knowledge of good
and evil and right and wrong,

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.070 align:middle line:84%
if we can't experience,
in ourselves,

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:52.600 align:middle line:90%
what those virtues are.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Such as, as you say, beauty,
truth, courage, kindness,

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:58.780 align:middle line:90%
generosity, compassion.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: You're speaking
of the fruits of spirit.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So if you speak
of that in Christian terms,

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:84%
there are gifts of spirit--
powers of prophecy,

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.720 align:middle line:90%
of knowledge, of wisdom.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.300 align:middle line:90%
And there are fruits of spirit--

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.330 align:middle line:84%
self-control, goodness,
kindness, and so on, and so

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.130 align:middle line:90%
forth.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Those things are demonstrations
of spiritual accomplishment.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.360 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else, those things.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.860 align:middle line:84%
As to your prophecy,
which would-- oh,

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:84%
if something phenomenal is
happening, it must be from God.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.200 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So a lot of people
go to ayahuasca retreats,

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.750 align:middle line:90%
have phenomenal experiences.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.700 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people will use
cannabis and mushrooms

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.410 align:middle line:90%
and have phenomenal experiences.

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.730 align:middle line:90%
They'll have a dream.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Something extraordinary
will happen.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.240 align:middle line:90%
They'll have a synchronicity.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Something very striking
will happen to them.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, this is
the universe speaking to me.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily God, though.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Not
necessarily goodness.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.025 align:middle line:84%
So don't confuse phenomena
with spiritual truth.

00:19:57.025 --> 00:19:57.900 align:middle line:90%
They're not the same.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: I say that across
the board, not to you.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.080 align:middle line:84%
I think you probably
know the difference.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I understand
what you're saying.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: But you know, as
we move around in the world,

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.195 align:middle line:90%
a lot of people don't get that.

00:20:08.195 --> 00:20:09.820 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
listening to this show,

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.540 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a little bit
of a different audience.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.110 align:middle line:84%
They'll appreciate
this much more.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:17.395 align:middle line:84%
But in mainstream society,
those things are unknown.

00:20:17.395 --> 00:20:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are unknown.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And so there, to me, we
have to look at, as you say,

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.730 align:middle line:84%
the bad guys or the
good guys, right?

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:29.020 align:middle line:84%
We need to look at the
greater picture of the realms

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.580 align:middle line:90%
beyond the Earth plane.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:35.380 align:middle line:84%
At least sandwich out one
plane up and one plane down,

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:39.250 align:middle line:84%
that we are sandwiched between
dimensions of refinement

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:84%
and less refinement--
lighter and darker.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And so if these realms
and the beings within them

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:50.050 align:middle line:84%
can permeate into
this realm, and begin

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:54.160 align:middle line:84%
influencing, demanding,
interfering, even giving

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:90%
lovely guidance and such.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.750 align:middle line:84%
We're never alone
because we are depending

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.040 align:middle line:90%
on our own field of resonance.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.780 align:middle line:84%
We are always being
influenced also

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.260 align:middle line:84%
from these higher
and lower realms.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Agreed.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.935 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you talk
about that whole dance

00:21:05.935 --> 00:21:07.840 align:middle line:84%
and share with people,
even viscerally,

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.950 align:middle line:90%
what that looks like?

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And you can use outlandish
language if you wish to.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Good.

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:13.960 align:middle line:90%
I like to hear that.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Because it's important
we understand

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.160 align:middle line:90%
we're being influenced by both.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.400 align:middle line:84%
The key thing to
see here, for me,

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.230 align:middle line:84%
is that free will and
the absolute sovereignty

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:30.070 align:middle line:84%
of the individual's
decision-making process.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.650 align:middle line:84%
To know good and evil, to
know right and wrong, to know

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.380 align:middle line:90%
truth and falsehood is primary.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:40.990 align:middle line:84%
All the time, there are positive
disembodied supernatural

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:46.840 align:middle line:84%
entities trying to promote
discernment and positive

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.030 align:middle line:90%
excellent discrimination.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.730 align:middle line:84%
An undiscriminating
human is about human.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:56.270 align:middle line:84%
You want discriminating,
discerning, knowledgeable,

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:58.500 align:middle line:90%
wise, judgmental humans.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Judgment-- if you can't
judge, you'll be dead.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.780 align:middle line:84%
If I can't judge to cross the
road if it's safe, I'm dead.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.040 align:middle line:84%
If I can't judge a good
person from a bad person,

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm in trouble.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.680 align:middle line:84%
So you want discrimination
judgment, discernment, knowing.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.790 align:middle line:84%
There are negative disembodied
supernatural entities-- real,

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.290 align:middle line:90%
very real--

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:21.680 align:middle line:84%
who want the opposite of that,
who want you to not judge,

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.660 align:middle line:90%
not discriminate.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
the parallels there

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.210 align:middle line:84%
in mainstream culture
at the moment.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.520 align:middle line:90%
Don't be judgmental.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.770 align:middle line:90%
Don't discriminate.

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.000 align:middle line:84%
They don't want you
to see absolutes,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.140 align:middle line:90%
that everything's relative.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.190 align:middle line:84%
It's all about, essentially,
human ethics and laws that ebb

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.290 align:middle line:90%
and flow over the millennia.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:42.670 align:middle line:90%
That's wrong.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:84%
That's demonic influence,
no question about it.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't like to talk
about that a ton,

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.540 align:middle line:84%
because I like to put the
power where it belongs,

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.290 align:middle line:84%
which is a God-given
power in free will, which

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:57.010 align:middle line:84%
all those entities-- strangely
enough-- have to respect.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.760 align:middle line:84%
What the negative demonic
powers do, which-- again,

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.010 align:middle line:84%
I emphasize that I'm not
speaking figuratively,

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:06.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean literally--
what they want to do

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.320 align:middle line:84%
is persuade you to
give your power away.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit like the
mythology of a vampire.

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.632 align:middle line:84%
Vampire knocks on your door
and says, oh, hello, Regina.

00:23:14.632 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if I could perhaps
come in for a few minutes

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and maybe we could
have a cocktail.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.020 align:middle line:90%
And you go, uh, sure.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.510 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you've given
permission, he's got you.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: If you say
no, he cannot come in.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:28.030 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Because you've been
given divine will.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So even those
entities who appear

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:36.400 align:middle line:84%
so powerful and
mysterious and sinister,

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:90%
they have to respect free will.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So the only power that
empire, the administration

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.920 align:middle line:84%
of that supernatural
force, and the supernatural

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.300 align:middle line:90%
forces themselves have--

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.940 align:middle line:84%
the only power they
have is the trick

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:53.650 align:middle line:84%
to get you to give your
consent to their naughtiness.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Now have you, by chance, read
the book, "The Golden Star"

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.120 align:middle line:90%
by Jean Michaud--

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.580 align:middle line:90%
M-I-C-H-A-U-D?

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:04.442 align:middle line:84%
French author, although I
think he lived in Britain.

00:24:04.442 --> 00:24:06.400 align:middle line:84%
This was in the early
part of the last century.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.525 align:middle line:90%
And he wrote a little book.

00:24:07.525 --> 00:24:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's a tale told by a
sage to two little children

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.687 align:middle line:84%
to take them through the
seven realms of existence.

00:24:14.687 --> 00:24:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Oh, right.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what
was beautiful about it

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:23.260 align:middle line:84%
is that it was showing
these little children, yes,

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.835 align:middle line:84%
these thunderous inky skies,
and these distorted beings--

00:24:26.835 --> 00:24:28.150 align:middle line:90%
and is very visceral.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:29.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful read--

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.110 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to the
most sublime realms,

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:84%
was that these beings are
living at their level of reality

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.300 align:middle line:90%
and learning.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And they may be
bleeding over into this.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:84%
But that is their
job, in a sense--

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.810 align:middle line:84%
whether it's self-designated--
to live as they live,

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.490 align:middle line:84%
influence as they
do, and do what

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:51.257 align:middle line:84%
they do because that's their
level of maturity as a being.

00:24:51.257 --> 00:24:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: I get you.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah?

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it's
not even in one sense,

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.873 align:middle line:84%
and in some senses,
it's not even malicious.

00:24:57.873 --> 00:25:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Now there are, I think,
very, very powerful entities

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.680 align:middle line:84%
that work from
darker realms who do

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.750 align:middle line:84%
know the difference
between right and wrong

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and-- for reasons I will
never comprehend-- choose

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.450 align:middle line:84%
to create negative influences
on various planets,

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:12.723 align:middle line:90%
including this one.

00:25:12.723 --> 00:25:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Yeah,
we'll have to talk

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:14.620 align:middle line:90%
about that some other time.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll
talk about it later.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:17.575 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just saying
that it's their job.

00:25:17.575 --> 00:25:18.950 align:middle line:84%
They're just acting
like they do.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And the upper realms
are acting as they do.

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.438 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Well, let me come
on that a moment, though.

00:25:23.438 --> 00:25:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so fascinating,
I can't pass that up.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.135 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, please.

00:25:26.135 --> 00:25:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Please do.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:27.430 align:middle line:90%
We've got time.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: OK, so those
negative entities,

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.100 align:middle line:90%
they're part of the test.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.500 align:middle line:90%
So this life is a test.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a gift of learning, sure.

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:39.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's a test of faith,
experiential faith,

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.600 align:middle line:90%
in spiritual reality.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a test of that.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And spiritual reality is
reality because it is spiritual.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.440 align:middle line:90%
And I can prove that.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.310 align:middle line:90%
I can evidence that.

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:51.230 align:middle line:84%
I can show people why
that is, but I'm not

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.180 align:middle line:90%
interested in that right now.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
presume a lot of people

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:57.890 align:middle line:84%
feel a similar way
while listening to this.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Any people who
didn't feel that way,

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to get into that.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.200 align:middle line:84%
But the point I want
to make at the moment

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.945 align:middle line:84%
is the truth of the world
is available, as I say.

00:26:06.945 --> 00:26:08.070 align:middle line:90%
That's an incredible thing.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:12.380 align:middle line:84%
The truth of this is available,
if somebody wants it.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.050 align:middle line:84%
What that leads you to
is the understanding

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.690 align:middle line:90%
that this is a test.

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:19.448 align:middle line:90%
And the test is very simple.

00:26:19.448 --> 00:26:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Like, if somebody held a gun
to my head and said right,

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.942 align:middle line:84%
you've got 10 seconds to
say the meaning of life

00:26:24.942 --> 00:26:27.400 align:middle line:84%
the best you know it, or I'm
going to blow your brains out,

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.700 align:middle line:90%
I'd say, OK.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:34.640 align:middle line:84%
We are being asked to discern
good and evil, right and wrong

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:84%
behavior and conduct,
and truth and falsehood.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And how do I know that that is
coming to a conclusion point?

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.730 align:middle line:90%
Because it's in your face now.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:50.840 align:middle line:84%
So everybody is being asked
to consider these things.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.500 align:middle line:84%
What the negative
forces are doing

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.910 align:middle line:84%
are putting a
tremendous pressure--

00:26:55.910 --> 00:27:01.400 align:middle line:84%
a false pressure-- to present
a consensus that is untrue.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.190 align:middle line:90%
Beauty is not relative.

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:05.180 align:middle line:90%
It's absolute.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.590 align:middle line:90%
It's universal.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:10.850 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of a sunset, the
beauty of a lover's face,

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.340 align:middle line:84%
the beauty of form
and proportion,

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:90%
the beauty of color.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.890 align:middle line:90%
They're universal.

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:19.010 align:middle line:10%
You can show people anywhere
in the world a beautiful thing

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.090 align:middle line:10%
and they'll see it.

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:22.310 align:middle line:10%
As long as you remove the
cultural obstructions away,

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.970 align:middle line:10%
they can see it.

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:24.012 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:27:24.012 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So let let's play
a game for a minute, right?

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's say there's
a God, good guy.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:30.500 align:middle line:90%
And he says--

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or good woman.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Or, good woman.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is a
reason why it's male

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:38.270 align:middle line:84%
but I will get to that
another time-- an entity.

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:43.650 align:middle line:84%
God is there and he says,
OK, the game is come find me,

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Right there's another guy
that he actually made, Satan,

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:90%
and he says, OK.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:49.678 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to play a game too.

00:27:49.678 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And I've been asked
to play this role.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.730 align:middle line:84%
My rules are there's
nothing to find.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.160 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.210 align:middle line:84%
That is, if you're
teaching children--

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:01.880 align:middle line:90%
which I do at times--

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:02.990 align:middle line:90%
that's the game.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:04.430 align:middle line:90%
God's like, come find me.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a supernatural
amazing adventure for real.

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:10.807 align:middle line:84%
Not joking, not
figurative language here.

00:28:10.807 --> 00:28:12.140 align:middle line:90%
We're not speaking symbolically.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Real.

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And Satan's job, made by God
as part of that same test,

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.230 align:middle line:84%
is to say, there's
nothing to find.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Are you serious?

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:22.580 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing here, folks.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:23.750 align:middle line:90%
It's DNA.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.000 align:middle line:90%
It's an empty vacuum of space.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:25.875 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing here.

00:28:25.875 --> 00:28:26.805 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Make it up.

00:28:26.805 --> 00:28:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It's just humans.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:29.100 align:middle line:90%
We're the top of the tree.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:30.320 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.120 align:middle line:90%
That is the game.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.570 align:middle line:84%
All mainstream imperial
media across Europe,

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.060 align:middle line:84%
in particular, Africa,
Asia, and America

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.850 align:middle line:84%
too-- although America is
much freer, I'm glad to say.

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:44.750 align:middle line:84%
All imperial media is
tipped in this direction

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:47.870 align:middle line:84%
to say there's nothing
to find, all of it.

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Beauty shows you there's
something to find.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Truth shows you there's
something to find.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Because the deeper you pursue
it, you realize it was made.

00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:59.660 align:middle line:90%
That beauty was made.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.550 align:middle line:84%
It didn't just
evolve out of carbon.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It rose
as a happenstance.

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: It didn't just
evolve of, you know,

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:84%
nitrogen and hydrogen and
snot crawling out of an ocean.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.070 align:middle line:90%
It didn't.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.870 align:middle line:90%
That's garbage.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:11.970 align:middle line:90%
That evolution is garbage.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:12.950 align:middle line:90%
It was made.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:14.310 align:middle line:90%
It was designed.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:15.860 align:middle line:90%
It's grace and elegance.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:16.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a gift.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.790 align:middle line:84%
It's an invitation
to know divinity.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And all you've got to do is
trust your instincts on that.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Examine the good
scripture on that.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Speak to wise men
and women you can

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:29.840 align:middle line:84%
locate with a beating
heart in this world.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.970 align:middle line:84%
They will all agree
on that, all of them.

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:34.730 align:middle line:84%
But still, the truth is always
yours-- primarily is yours.

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:38.330 align:middle line:84%
But as you do that, it
will lead you to reality.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.820 align:middle line:84%
This negative game
leads you away.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Now that game, like
every game, is finite.

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.670 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't go on for millions
of years forever and ever.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:48.470 align:middle line:90%
It's finite.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:49.730 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:51.650 align:middle line:90%
It's coming to its conclusion.

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:54.470 align:middle line:84%
There's not a lot of
that game left now.

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:55.850 align:middle line:90%
Again, why can we say this?

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:59.720 align:middle line:90%
Because it's in your face now.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.090 align:middle line:84%
The guy, the good guy,
God is saying, OK, guys.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:04.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make this
really, really easy for you.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you so
much incredibly obvious

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:11.600 align:middle line:84%
good and evil in your face,
you'll have to make a decision.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:15.530 align:middle line:84%
You'll be impelled from within
and compelled from without

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:16.678 align:middle line:90%
to make a decision.

00:30:16.678 --> 00:30:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
make it really easy.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:18.610 align:middle line:90%
Because you know what?

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm wrapping this up soon.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.790 align:middle line:90%
This is finished soon.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And only those of you who have
taken the time and trouble

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.180 align:middle line:84%
to discern what is
real will come with me.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Everything else will be
completely deleted forever.

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:36.280 align:middle line:84%
The entire 3D superstructure
gone forever, gone.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.090 align:middle line:84%
That's the proposition
that I put forward to you.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And with each
passing minute, I'm

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.900 align:middle line:84%
more literal in how
I feel about that.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:45.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm not joking.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.850 align:middle line:90%
It's not figurative.

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:47.620 align:middle line:90%
I know you are.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: I can feel it.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.020 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it all my life.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's getting
faster and deeper.

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I feel this
is a critical time

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.880 align:middle line:84%
in human consciousness
to make that shift.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It is.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In terms of the end
of the 3D reality, I don't know.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.700 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.130 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of the
absolute necessity

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.230 align:middle line:84%
to start making these
leaps in consciousness,

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I feel it in my cells as
well, toward whatever end

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:12.670 align:middle line:90%
that might be.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And just to go back
for a moment, for any

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:17.140 align:middle line:84%
of the women in particular
watching, what you mean

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.570 align:middle line:84%
God's automatically
a male, you know,

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:20.890 align:middle line:90%
and the creator is a male?

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:22.180 align:middle line:90%
I just want to offer this.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:25.390 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at it through
a lens of ancient gnostics,

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.010 align:middle line:84%
you would say first
was the logos.

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.020 align:middle line:84%
That's simply the
thought, right?

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.570 align:middle line:84%
The thought, the
creative thought.

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Then the prima material
absorbs the thought

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:34.990 align:middle line:90%
and then makes manifest.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.600 align:middle line:84%
The male and female
work in perfect symmetry

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.990 align:middle line:90%
and companionship together.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So in my understanding,
you have the logos,

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.520 align:middle line:84%
the thought which is
classified as male

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.670 align:middle line:90%
in all ancient traditions--

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:47.628 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Like the sun.

00:31:47.628 --> 00:31:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like the sun, exactly.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:52.205 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And it's birthed
in life, which is female.

00:31:52.205 --> 00:31:53.830 align:middle line:84%
The two characters
without each other--

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The life is all
expressed through the female

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:56.080 align:middle line:90%
and the feminine.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah, agreed.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So there we go.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.615 align:middle line:84%
So let's just say
that is a companion

00:31:58.615 --> 00:32:00.055 align:middle line:90%
shift that is beautiful.

00:32:00.055 --> 00:32:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: You're very kind.

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:01.446 align:middle line:90%
You're very kind.

00:32:01.446 --> 00:32:03.860 align:middle line:84%
You're very kind to these
watchers and viewers,

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:04.720 align:middle line:90%
aren't you?

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.530 align:middle line:90%
How nice you are.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:06.640 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't have bothered.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I value kindness.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.730 align:middle line:90%
It is true.

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to go
into absolute good and evil.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And I just pulled this
from Nietzsche's "Beyond

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.803 align:middle line:84%
Good and Evil", just
the beginning line.

00:32:16.803 --> 00:32:18.220 align:middle line:10%
There's this
beautiful poem called

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.405 align:middle line:10%
"The Genius of the Heart".

00:32:19.405 --> 00:32:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And so we're only going
to share a few words.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.980 align:middle line:84%
It says, "the
genius of the heart

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:28.600 align:middle line:84%
silences all that is
loud and self-satisfied,

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.340 align:middle line:90%
teaching it to listen."

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So this-- again, this
noise, this distraction,

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:36.410 align:middle line:84%
this pulling down that
anything goes kind of message.

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:38.920 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
through your lens

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:43.430 align:middle line:84%
where we begin to discern
absolute good and evil.

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:46.660 align:middle line:84%
He's suggesting the
heart is one mechanism.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Absolute
good is reality.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:90%
Absolute evil is unreality.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: That's it.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.558 align:middle line:90%
It's as simple as that.

00:32:54.558 --> 00:32:56.430 align:middle line:90%
What is real is good.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:58.227 align:middle line:90%
What is unreal is bad.

00:32:58.227 --> 00:32:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because it's delusion.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Because it's delusion.

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So remember our
game, so the only game in town.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:04.590 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.792 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: The game is what
is real because what is real

00:33:07.792 --> 00:33:09.190 align:middle line:90%
is leading you to truth.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And that truth is your
exit from this classroom

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.660 align:middle line:84%
to lead the actual adult
spiritual life that this

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:17.650 align:middle line:90%
is preparation for.

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:19.450 align:middle line:90%
This is our childhood.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's soon to end.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And when it ends, we'll
go to a new world, which

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:30.700 align:middle line:84%
resembles this in some ways
but is without disharmony

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and without the test, because
the test has been completed.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:35.993 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is classically
considered the fourth realm--

00:33:35.993 --> 00:33:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Well, it's--

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in
classical teachings.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: In
classical teachings,

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:41.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't know which ones
you mean, but it could be.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Non-dimension
fourth realm, but go ahead.

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: I see.

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:44.920 align:middle line:84%
In my teaching,
it would be called

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.360 align:middle line:90%
the new Earth, the new heavens.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.000 align:middle line:90%
it's the same.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.292 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It could be the same.

00:33:49.292 --> 00:33:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Functionally
speaking, it looks the same.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Well, it's
a paradise world

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:55.240 align:middle line:84%
which only contains
the people who've

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.770 align:middle line:84%
taken the time to
discern, which frankly,

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:01.120 align:middle line:84%
are the people that you'd want
to spend time with in paradise.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.040 align:middle line:90%
So that's a good thing.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:07.510 align:middle line:84%
The unreal world
here is a world of--

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:08.889 align:middle line:90%
how can I say it--

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:09.790 align:middle line:90%
disavowal.

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.050 align:middle line:90%
A world of resignation.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:12.610 align:middle line:90%
A world of defeat.

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:17.409 align:middle line:84%
A world of giving consent
to things that are wicked.

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:20.420 align:middle line:90%
That's what creates evil.

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the word
sin, for example, in scripture,

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:28.300 align:middle line:84%
there's 26 different
terms for that.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And they range-- I call it
the traffic lights of sin--

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:33.130 align:middle line:84%
from a green
traffic light, which

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:34.580 align:middle line:90%
is like you've made a mistake.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.610 align:middle line:90%
So that's a kind of sin.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:38.739 align:middle line:84%
And there's Hebrew and
Greek words for that.

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's like,
you know, I thought

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.100 align:middle line:90%
it was OK to eat this food.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:46.140 align:middle line:84%
But I realize now that
it's hurting my body.

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Or, I thought it was OK
to kiss this lovely woman.

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And I realize that's not a good
idea because I don't know her

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:54.290 align:middle line:90%
well enough and it's not fair.

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:55.090 align:middle line:90%
That's an error.

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:58.310 align:middle line:84%
People make those errors
in life and get over it.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:59.990 align:middle line:90%
You make a change.

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.790 align:middle line:90%
You turn.

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:01.690 align:middle line:90%
You change direction.

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:02.857 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You learn from it.

00:35:02.857 --> 00:35:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: You learn from
it, which is repentance.

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:06.895 align:middle line:84%
So you realize you've
made a mistake.

00:35:06.895 --> 00:35:08.130 align:middle line:90%
You change direction.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:10.840 align:middle line:90%
That's what that word means.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.910 align:middle line:84%
The orange level--
the amber level--

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:16.030 align:middle line:84%
is unlawful, where
you're actually going

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:18.290 align:middle line:90%
against what is divine law.

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:19.880 align:middle line:90%
You're going against nature.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.650 align:middle line:90%
You're committing bad acts.

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:22.670 align:middle line:90%
You're stealing stuff.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:23.750 align:middle line:90%
You're being unkind.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.810 align:middle line:84%
You're adulterous--
unlawful stuff,

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:30.520 align:middle line:84%
which everyone knows that's
not a prudent and virtuous way

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.320 align:middle line:90%
to behave.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not OK.

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:35.165 align:middle line:84%
The red level is real
transgression, where

00:35:35.165 --> 00:35:36.290 align:middle line:90%
you're like, you know what?

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:37.160 align:middle line:90%
There is no God.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.270 align:middle line:90%
That's garbage.

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:41.510 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, as an
unregenerate person,

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:43.280 align:middle line:10%
I am going to just
do whatever it

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:47.270 align:middle line:10%
takes to make me comfortable
and secure and happy,

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:49.160 align:middle line:10%
and whatever pleases me.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And if that means I damaged
somebody or murder them,

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:55.493 align:middle line:84%
or rape them or traffic them,
or eat them, then I'll do it.

00:35:55.493 --> 00:35:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And to hell with it,
because I have the power.

00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:58.490 align:middle line:90%
To hell with that.

00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:59.510 align:middle line:90%
That's your red level.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.285 align:middle line:90%
That's like true transgression.

00:36:01.285 --> 00:36:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Now all the
26 or 27 different terms

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:08.450 align:middle line:84%
for all those
things all mean sin.

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:10.820 align:middle line:90%
Now that's a test of free will.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So when you get to a green
light and you thought,

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:14.103 align:middle line:90%
mm, you know what?

00:36:14.103 --> 00:36:15.020 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't very good.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.150 align:middle line:84%
That's your
opportunity to change.

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So that repentance--
you know, again,

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.690 align:middle line:84%
if you were teaching this
in a Christian school--

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:23.780 align:middle line:90%
is from two terms.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Nacham, a Hebrew
word which means

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:28.000 align:middle line:90%
lamentation-- like, oh, dear.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.260 align:middle line:90%
I've made a mistake.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.770 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't good.

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:33.512 align:middle line:84%
And another word,
Shuv, which means--

00:36:33.512 --> 00:36:36.020 align:middle line:84%
[SIGHS] --I'm not
going to do that.

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.520 align:middle line:90%
I vow to change direction.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So repentance, Nacham, which
is almost like, oh, no.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.400 align:middle line:90%
It's like an exhale.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a sigh.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Lamentation and
changing direction.

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.860 align:middle line:90%
That's what repentance is.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:49.910 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:53.128 align:middle line:84%
So to repent in modern language
is a really good thing.

00:36:53.128 --> 00:36:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And if we just didn't use the
word repentance, you know what?

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:57.720 align:middle line:84%
No one would have a
problem with that.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.060 align:middle line:84%
So repentance is a funny
word in the modern world.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:03.140 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't even use that
because people think it's

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.360 align:middle line:90%
so antiquated and so strange.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:09.950 align:middle line:84%
But really, it's just
meaning the vow for goodness

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and a recognition
that one has erred,

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.790 align:middle line:84%
one has gone in the
wrong direction.

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
better way to do it.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's a funny thing to talk
about sin and repentance.

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:21.590 align:middle line:84%
But we've touched on some
esoteric Christian principles,

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:24.050 align:middle line:84%
it's good to actually
define what they are.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:25.790 align:middle line:84%
So you're asking
about what is good.

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:27.020 align:middle line:90%
What is good is what is real.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.370 align:middle line:90%
What is bad is what is unreal.

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:33.802 align:middle line:84%
That unreality, though, leads
to a moral dissolution, where--

00:37:33.802 --> 00:37:35.510 align:middle line:84%
as we've seen in the
news at the moment--

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:39.350 align:middle line:84%
lots of rich and famous
politicians and world leaders

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and actors and
musicians, and whatnot,

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.610 align:middle line:84%
are involved in some of the most
hideous things I've ever heard

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:45.410 align:middle line:90%
of, which--

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:46.700 align:middle line:90%
I've known this all along.

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To me, absolute evil.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.580 align:middle line:90%
We know this.

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Absolute evil
is absolute unreality.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So because
they don't see that,

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:58.120 align:middle line:84%
their soul vessel actually
begins to crumble.

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And so again, the
soul vessel in Hebrew

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:03.980 align:middle line:84%
would be nephesh, in
Greek would psuche,

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.400 align:middle line:84%
which is a vessel that
can receive spirit.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Again, that would
be ruah or pneuma.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And when that vessel
has received spirit,

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.170 align:middle line:90%
then you're a spiritual person.

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:17.960 align:middle line:84%
But if the vessel is
empty over and over

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and over, it remains
empty over the decades,

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:24.440 align:middle line:84%
it actually crumbles
and disintegrates.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, you
could truly say for real,

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.450 align:middle line:90%
this is a soulless man.

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:31.040 align:middle line:90%
This is a soulless woman.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.250 align:middle line:90%
Their soul is gone.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:33.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it has.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:35.700 align:middle line:90%
The soul is not immortal.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.080 align:middle line:84%
It's as a transcendental
principle,

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.240 align:middle line:84%
which is it can be
filled with spirit.

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.950 align:middle line:90%
That is immortality.

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Only in God is
there immortality.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Without that filling, though, of
this vessel, it cannot happen.

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So absolute evil--
one more point--

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:55.220 align:middle line:84%
absolute evil,
therefore, is the choice,

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.590 align:middle line:84%
the unremorseful
choice, to never fill

00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:00.440 align:middle line:84%
this with spirit, and
in fact, discard it.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.860 align:middle line:84%
At that point, you're
dealing with an inhuman--

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.600 align:middle line:84%
literally and inhuman
person-- at that point.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.450 align:middle line:90%
So that's absolute evil.

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Absolute good is
the reverse of that,

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.620 align:middle line:84%
where someone
treasures their vessel

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.210 align:middle line:90%
and fills it with spirit--

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:15.933 align:middle line:90%
truth, only truth.

00:39:15.933 --> 00:39:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And as that gets to
the top, then you're

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.460 align:middle line:84%
experiencing a
witness of something

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:21.710 align:middle line:84%
that is transcendental
that is also

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:24.740 align:middle line:90%
carried over to the next world.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Only that can be carried
over full of spirit.

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:29.690 align:middle line:90%
Other than that, this is it.

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:31.770 align:middle line:90%
This is all you've got.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in this
delusional and illusory world,

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.950 align:middle line:84%
where preferences is being
foisted as our reality--

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:43.460 align:middle line:90%
just choose your reality--

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.200 align:middle line:84%
have there have been
times, and if you

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.860 align:middle line:84%
can think of any kind of stark
examples, in which there's

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:54.170 align:middle line:84%
been a massly held assumption
of evil that you think

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:55.610 align:middle line:90%
was not accurate?

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Or a massly held assumption
of good that was not accurate?

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:05.307 align:middle line:90%
Christianity bad, new age good.

00:40:05.307 --> 00:40:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:07.098 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Wrong, wrong.

00:40:07.098 --> 00:40:08.557 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I see
what you're saying.

00:40:08.557 --> 00:40:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Christianity
good, new age bad.

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:11.768 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From the
basic principles

00:40:11.768 --> 00:40:14.758 align:middle line:84%
we were talking
about before, not

00:40:14.758 --> 00:40:16.800 align:middle line:84%
the way the Christian
church has been constructed

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.560 align:middle line:90%
to delude in its own right.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: You have
to-- again, let's

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.970 align:middle line:84%
highlight that again, because
it's important as you say that.

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Real Christian practice
is spiritual life.

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Of all my
life of nearly 50 years

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.690 align:middle line:84%
now of knowing
this work, nothing

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:37.580 align:middle line:84%
has come close to the potency
of pure Christian practice.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.310 align:middle line:84%
I call it esoteric
Christianity to distinguish it

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:41.162 align:middle line:90%
from the other.

00:40:41.162 --> 00:40:43.790 align:middle line:84%
The other, most people's
experience of Christianity

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:45.230 align:middle line:90%
is the church.

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:46.220 align:middle line:90%
The Catholic church.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:50.790 align:middle line:84%
The Methodist church, various
things like Jehovah's Witness,

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Mormonism, all these
different things--

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Seventh Day
Adventists, whatever.

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:58.920 align:middle line:84%
That's institutionalized
Christian-themed religion.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.450 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
I'm talking about.

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:01.250 align:middle line:90%
That's not it.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the
theme park version.

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: That's the
Disneyland version.

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Disneyland Christianity
is abhorrent to me.

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.010 align:middle line:90%
It's no use at all.

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So even
in my language,

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.010 align:middle line:84%
you know, I purposefully
don't talk about Christianity

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:14.450 align:middle line:84%
to mainstream
audiences because I

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:15.950 align:middle line:84%
know they're not
going to understand

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:16.940 align:middle line:90%
what I'm talking about.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.010 align:middle line:84%
I would hope, of course,
that your viewers--

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have a much
more nuanced and mystical--

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --are much
more thinking people.

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:26.237 align:middle line:84%
And they'll think,
well, wait a second.

00:41:26.237 --> 00:41:28.070 align:middle line:84%
He's not just going to
say that and suddenly

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:29.800 align:middle line:90%
jump into ignorance.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.600 align:middle line:90%
What does he mean?

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.365 align:middle line:90%
So they'll give me that pause.

00:41:32.365 --> 00:41:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And then in that
pause, you know,

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.760 align:middle line:84%
we have a chance
to reflect on that.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So Christianity
popularity now, if you

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:42.920 align:middle line:84%
walk around Portland, Oregon,
San Francisco, California,

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Seattle, Washington,
and said, hey, I'm

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:49.400 align:middle line:84%
a Christian, people will punch
you in the face, most likely.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
considered now wrong.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:56.600 align:middle line:84%
If I said, hey, I'm a
social justice new age--

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:59.840 align:middle line:84%
you know-- unreligious person,
a humanist, people will say,

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:00.650 align:middle line:90%
fantastic.

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:01.700 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.530 align:middle line:90%
Glad to meet you.

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I see the error in
those perceptions.

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.460 align:middle line:90%
So it's really tough.

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.573 align:middle line:84%
Like even in saying it,
new age Christianity--

00:42:11.573 --> 00:42:12.490 align:middle line:90%
you know, they're, oh.

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:14.330 align:middle line:90%
They're loaded issues.

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:16.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's a task to
say, well, do you

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.900 align:middle line:90%
know the truth of those things?

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Are you prepared to look at
the truth of those things?

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.130 align:middle line:90%
Is it good to live in a city?

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Is it good to live
in a rural place?

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:25.670 align:middle line:90%
What's the truth of that?

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:27.532 align:middle line:84%
Is that relative, or
is that universal?

00:42:27.532 --> 00:42:28.990 align:middle line:84%
I know the answer
to that question.

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: And it's not--

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.880 align:middle line:90%
it's not relative.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.140 align:middle line:84%
They're universal
answers, those things.

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.490 align:middle line:84%
But they're tough because
all of our lives, anyone

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:39.590 align:middle line:84%
born in the last
100 years, we've

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:43.003 align:middle line:84%
been tutored in relativism
and collectivism.

00:42:43.003 --> 00:42:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes we have.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And we've been
tutored to say, you know,

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:47.780 align:middle line:84%
it's not right to say this
is right and this is wrong.

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:49.040 align:middle line:90%
Who are you to say?

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.540 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're tutored in.

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:52.310 align:middle line:90%
That is wickedness.

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:56.510 align:middle line:84%
That whole idea of it's not
right to call right and wrong

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:58.640 align:middle line:90%
is the death of society.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I hear
what you're saying.

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm finding it really
interesting where I live.

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:05.090 align:middle line:84%
I live in a very rural
area at the foothills

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:08.060 align:middle line:84%
of the Sierra Nevada
mountain range surrounded

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.250 align:middle line:90%
by farm animals.

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Every kind of crop
grows around there.

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:16.190 align:middle line:84%
It is stunningly beautiful
in its expression of nature,

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:17.330 align:middle line:90%
very abundant.

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm seeing
happen is my father

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:22.340 align:middle line:84%
originally bought this property
and built the house on it

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.590 align:middle line:90%
many years ago.

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:25.430 align:middle line:84%
They're all-- that
generation is gone.

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:26.230 align:middle line:90%
They've sold.

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:27.390 align:middle line:90%
They're dying out.

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:31.460 align:middle line:84%
But what's coming in, the people
coming in in their place--

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.860 align:middle line:84%
and I'm seeing this
phenomenon all over now even

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:35.240 align:middle line:90%
in magazines--

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:41.420 align:middle line:84%
are mostly fundamentalist
Christian and Mormons,

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.680 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Our whole area has
families with 5, 6, 7

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.220 align:middle line:90%
kids that have moved in.

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:51.020 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
about it is they

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.470 align:middle line:90%
can see what they're doing.

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:58.762 align:middle line:84%
It's a backlash against the
world of untruths and chaotic--

00:43:58.762 --> 00:44:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Yeah, they're
overcompensating.

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
overcompensating.

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And so they're trying
to get the kids--

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:04.130 align:middle line:90%
which is beautiful.

00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:05.630 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
get the kids back.

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:07.250 align:middle line:84%
They raise little
goats and pigs.

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: I know, it's
a nice overcompensation.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a nice
overcompensation,

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.260 align:middle line:90%
but it is a compensation.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.120 align:middle line:84%
But I feel, in their
hearts, they're

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:17.670 align:middle line:84%
just so weary of the
messaging outside.

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:19.808 align:middle line:84%
They don't want their
kids to be exposed to it.

00:44:19.808 --> 00:44:22.100 align:middle line:84%
A lot them are homeschooling
for the exact same reason.

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:26.300 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, almost
every family around us

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:30.070 align:middle line:84%
now is back to land, back
to nature, Christianity--

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:32.210 align:middle line:84%
but organized,
formal Christianity

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:34.820 align:middle line:84%
in terms of religious
institutions.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:35.700 align:middle line:90%
I understand it.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: I do.

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, modern society,
especially in Europe

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:43.130 align:middle line:84%
more than anywhere
else, is debauched.

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And it is degenerate, I have
to say, especially in England,

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.070 align:middle line:90%
France, Germany, Spain.

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:53.150 align:middle line:84%
America don't realize how lucky
they are to have choices here.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us about what
you mean by the debauchery,

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:58.850 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, in the European
nations compared to the US.

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Because most US
citizens would say,

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:03.000 align:middle line:84%
well, that's happening here
to a large extent as well.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.670 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference
between them?

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: That's a
media illusion that's

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:07.990 align:middle line:90%
been drawn over people's life.

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Think, hey, you know,
secretly, we all

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.020 align:middle line:84%
think that Britain
and Germany and France

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:15.170 align:middle line:84%
are kind of like a bit more
sophisticated and a bit more

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:18.580 align:middle line:84%
elegant and gracious-- and
have this history, and just

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:19.860 align:middle line:90%
more civilized people.

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Wrong, totally wrong.

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Those people have been crushed.

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And I know that because
I've lived there for--

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, crushed by
their traditions, even.

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:27.262 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --most of
my life have been

00:45:27.262 --> 00:45:32.740 align:middle line:84%
crushed by aristocratic
families who serve evil.

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.072 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:45:34.072 --> 00:45:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And that's
been unchanged

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:37.960 align:middle line:90%
for at least two millennia.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.800 align:middle line:84%
What's different about America
is that although it was

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.270 align:middle line:90%
certainly a naivete at times--

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and if I may say, an
inelegance from time

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:48.918 align:middle line:90%
to time in certain quarters--

00:45:48.918 --> 00:45:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And immaturity.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: --from an immaturity.

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're still
growing our history.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Just like a child who
went into a fancy restaurant

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:58.790 align:middle line:84%
with clutter around, and not
know what fork to pick up.

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't mean they're
bad, they just don't know yet.

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're a young culture

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:05.050 align:middle line:84%
There's a gullibility
and a naivete,

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:08.890 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes, an
ungrateful aspect to that.

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:11.180 align:middle line:84%
But let me show you
the flip side of that.

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:13.637 align:middle line:84%
There's a positivity,
a cheerfulness--

00:46:13.637 --> 00:46:14.595 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A creativity.

00:46:14.595 --> 00:46:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --a creativity,
an opportunity

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.360 align:middle line:84%
that does not exist
anywhere else in the world.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.810 align:middle line:90%
It's only in America.

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: I am much happier
to be an American citizen

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.190 align:middle line:90%
than a British citizen.

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm proud to be in
this land of excellence,

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:34.802 align:middle line:84%
which is exceptional in
its spiritual opportunity.

00:46:34.802 --> 00:46:36.510 align:middle line:84%
That there is nowhere
else in the world--

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:39.550 align:middle line:84%
take my word for this-- where
you can have that except here.

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:41.800 align:middle line:84%
We have to now look at
what's right and wrong.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Big political issues
about abortion,

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:47.418 align:middle line:84%
about race, about
immigration, about borders--

00:46:47.418 --> 00:46:48.460 align:middle line:90%
what do they make you do?

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:49.800 align:middle line:90%
They make you think about it.

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.790 align:middle line:84%
They may think, well,
hang on a second.

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:54.820 align:middle line:90%
Is it OK to have open borders?

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.770 align:middle line:90%
What does that do to a country?

00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:57.910 align:middle line:90%
What is an open border?

00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:00.220 align:middle line:90%
What is a country even?

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Now whatever you think about
that, that's a very, very

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:04.300 align:middle line:90%
important question to ask.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's
a very important--

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Whatever
you think about that,

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.500 align:middle line:84%
however kind and bring
everyone of the whole world

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:12.470 align:middle line:84%
into my yard, or nobody except
people who look like me--

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:13.270 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:16.270 align:middle line:84%
One extreme or the other,
everything in between, they're

00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:18.580 align:middle line:84%
really important
questions to ask

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:22.100 align:middle line:84%
which were never asked
in the common household

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.650 align:middle line:90%
until recently.

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:25.510 align:middle line:84%
In my kitchen table
with these people

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I care about and the
things that we contemplate

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:31.900 align:middle line:90%
in this home, what is a border?

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:34.600 align:middle line:90%
What is death?

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.730 align:middle line:90%
Is it murder killing a fetus?

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Or does it have to
be a certain age?

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:40.090 align:middle line:90%
Or is that health care?

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:43.190 align:middle line:90%
Is that reproductive well-being?

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:44.320 align:middle line:90%
What even is that?

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And to have people
asking those questions

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.400 align:middle line:90%
is incredibly important.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.890 align:middle line:90%
Because truth leads to reality.

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:55.853 align:middle line:84%
Reality is the body,
the imagination of God.

00:47:55.853 --> 00:47:56.770 align:middle line:90%
What are those things?

00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:57.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's define them.

00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:59.180 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at them.

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:00.850 align:middle line:84%
If people are doing
that, we're going

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:04.160 align:middle line:84%
to come to a consensus,
which is true.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:08.140 align:middle line:84%
We're going to find common
ground, which is substantial.

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:09.760 align:middle line:84%
We're going to say,
OK, if you have

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.080 align:middle line:84%
a preference against
this culture, this music,

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:12.880 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:17.440 align:middle line:84%
That's fine because there's
common ground of moral virtue,

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:21.340 align:middle line:84%
of decency, of civility,
of human creativity.

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:23.510 align:middle line:90%
And potential is huge.

00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:25.990 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want to vote
Republican or Democrat,

00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:27.230 align:middle line:90%
that's fine.

00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:29.920 align:middle line:84%
We're all really
libertarians, in that we

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:30.930 align:middle line:90%
are the sovereign power.

00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.040 align:middle line:90%
I detest politics.

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.603 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: We are
the sovereign power.

00:48:33.603 --> 00:48:35.020 align:middle line:84%
There is a sovereign
above us that

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:37.720 align:middle line:84%
grants us that power in
virtue as an endowment,

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.180 align:middle line:90%
as a graceful emanation.

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And all of us are
equal in that regard--

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.320 align:middle line:90%
all of us.

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:47.140 align:middle line:84%
The difference is, if you
don't ask those questions

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:50.590 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have common
ground, then our differences--

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:53.350 align:middle line:84%
our ethnic and racial and
intellectual and physical

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:56.500 align:middle line:84%
differences--
become separations.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.710 align:middle line:90%
They needn't be.

00:48:57.710 --> 00:49:00.010 align:middle line:84%
They're complementary
to each other.

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
thing that when we

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:04.660 align:middle line:84%
ask these questions,
forced by what's

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:07.300 align:middle line:84%
on the television and
newspapers, is good.

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:08.990 align:middle line:90%
So I remain optimistic in this.

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Even though I think this game
is drawing to its conclusion--

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.947 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you again, the
whole thing forever--

00:49:14.947 --> 00:49:16.780 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a good
thing because it means

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:19.180 align:middle line:90%
that the classroom is finished.

00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:20.250 align:middle line:90%
We've graduated.

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:21.370 align:middle line:90%
Enough people.

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:23.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not many, but the
critical mass of people

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.120 align:middle line:90%
is now in existence.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as that number
is reached, this is gone.

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, then
a final statement

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:31.810 align:middle line:90%
because we are out of time.

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is, you
believe it is our duty

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:37.170 align:middle line:84%
to begin discerning right
and wrong-- our duty.

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:38.920 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: It says we
have a responsibility

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:43.840 align:middle line:10%
to know right and wrong, good
and evil, truth and falsehood.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.550 align:middle line:90%
You have to do it your own way.

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:49.242 align:middle line:84%
You should seek wise
counsel on that from living,

00:49:49.242 --> 00:49:50.950 align:middle line:84%
breathing people you
can sit in front of.

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Don't trust YouTube.

00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:54.160 align:middle line:90%
You can go to scripture.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:58.370 align:middle line:84%
You can speak to your own
heart and mind about that.

00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:03.250 align:middle line:84%
But your duty to know good and
evil makes this world better.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:05.952 align:middle line:84%
If you avoid that and
try not to offend people,

00:50:05.952 --> 00:50:07.660 align:middle line:84%
and don't say things
that are difficult--

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:10.030 align:middle line:90%
don't go against the grain--

00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:12.040 align:middle line:90%
you perpetuate the problem.

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:15.670 align:middle line:84%
So knowing good and evil,
exercising that discernment,

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:19.190 align:middle line:90%
is a spiritual life.

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And I always love
our conversations.

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And they always
stretch people a bit.

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And it also requires
nuanced thinking,

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and that we're not
encouraged toward that.

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.748 align:middle line:84%
And so again, Neil, I love
spending time with you.

00:50:31.748 --> 00:50:33.790 align:middle line:84%
We could probably go on
another five or six hours

00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:35.330 align:middle line:90%
on all of this.

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:36.130 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:37.535 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Thank you.

00:50:37.535 --> 00:50:39.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I hope this has been
an intriguing conversation

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:40.210 align:middle line:10%
for you.

00:50:40.210 --> 00:50:42.293 align:middle line:10%
I know it can be a bit
challenging, that time when

00:50:42.293 --> 00:50:43.300 align:middle line:10%
Neil and I get together.

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.540 align:middle line:84%
But I really feel we need to
go more deeply into reflections

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:49.960 align:middle line:84%
on the nature of reality and the
nature of good and evil itself.

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:51.890 align:middle line:10%
To go there with Neil,
you can find his work
