>>REGINA MEREDITH:
This conversation

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.950 align:middle line:10%
is going to be in
part about polarity--

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.410 align:middle line:10%
the hallmark of our third
dimensional reality.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.070 align:middle line:10%
Wendy Kennedy will
explain how it is our job

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.740 align:middle line:10%
to proficiently inhabit
the nature of duality

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.470 align:middle line:10%
until we have shifted our
frequencies beyond this game.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.448 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to Wendy.

00:00:35.448 --> 00:00:36.990 align:middle line:84%
It's so good to see
you again, Wendy.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WENDY KENNEDY: Oh,
it's so nice to be here.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you had
so much transmitted

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.420 align:middle line:84%
through you and to you
since we last talked.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.030 align:middle line:84%
But you know what I'd like to do
is if we can quickly just tread

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.560 align:middle line:84%
back over one of the features
of our last conversation, which

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.010 align:middle line:84%
is about this period of time
because I think right now we all

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:84%
gain a certain amount of comfort
in having numbers, periods

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.410 align:middle line:90%
of time and so forth.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was called
the frequency war.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So tell us the years
and what that means

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.330 align:middle line:84%
and where we are
in it and what's

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.765 align:middle line:84%
going to happen at the end
before we get into the duality.

00:01:09.765 --> 00:01:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: Sure.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.310 align:middle line:10%
So my guides talk about the
period from 2019 to 2026

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:10%
as being referred to in the
future as frequency wars.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.190 align:middle line:10%
So during this
period that we're in,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.220 align:middle line:10%
there's a lot of vying for
our control of our frequencies

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.960 align:middle line:10%
at the mental, emotional,
and physical levels.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.178 align:middle line:10%
So this is happening
at the human level,

00:01:32.178 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:10%
where there are humans
who want to stay in power.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.303 align:middle line:84%
And so they're manipulating
the way that we think,

00:01:36.303 --> 00:01:37.400 align:middle line:90%
the way that we feel.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And then there's also an extra
dimensional aspect to it.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So I think people
are waking up to see

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:84%
some of the manipulation that's
happening at the human level

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.690 align:middle line:84%
because we're seeing repeated
patterns very quickly now.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.389 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's a
whole 'nother level that's

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:54.472 align:middle line:90%
going to start to open up.

00:01:54.472 --> 00:01:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A layer
that's invisible to us?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: Yes.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so how
do you-- how would you

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:84%
describe that
invisible layer, as you

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.380 align:middle line:84%
call it, interdimensional,
or even extraterrestrial type

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.770 align:middle line:90%
of interface?

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: In what regard?

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In terms of how
does the interdimensional work

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:84%
with humanity and
control and manipulate.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: So, as the
guides explain it to me,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.720 align:middle line:90%
there are bloodlines.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.970 align:middle line:84%
There are humans who know, who
have been taught from birth

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.970 align:middle line:84%
that they are part of a larger
community, that they are part

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.230 align:middle line:84%
of a galactic
family, so to speak,

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and that they understand
the nature of reality

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:90%
and how it's manipulated.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're working with
some of these beings.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And so some of them
are guided to do this.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And then there are other
beings who have stepped forward

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and are communicating
with humans.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we
abdicate our power.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And we say, well, somebody in
a higher dimension, this beings

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.950 align:middle line:84%
in a higher dimension, so they
must know more than I know.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So, OK, whatever you
need, I'm going to do it.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's not necessarily true.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.220 align:middle line:84%
They don't all have our
best interests at heart.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And the guides say
it's just the same

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.210 align:middle line:90%
as it is here on the planet.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.190 align:middle line:90%
There are great people.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's some people doing
some not so great things.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.825 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing
in the higher realms.

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
always interesting

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.140 align:middle line:84%
because one of the
things I find fascinating

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.360 align:middle line:84%
is to watch the
game of conspiracy.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've covered it a lot
over the last 25 years.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So when people speak in very
declarative and authoritative

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.650 align:middle line:84%
ways about conspiracy
at the top,

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.110 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes they haven't a clue
of what's actually guiding this.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And the faces that we
see and the names we know

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:90%
are generally the minions.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:84%
This is a very dark, quiet
place that they operate from

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:90%
and manipulate from.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So how does humanity
start confronting that?

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Or not even confronting,
how do we deal with that?

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Just raise our own
frequencies, just

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.240 align:middle line:84%
shift our own game so
that we really can't

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle line:90%
be manipulated any longer?

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: And I think
that's exactly it.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And the guides have spent a
lot of time talking about this

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and trying to help
people to understand

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.980 align:middle line:84%
how to work with
their own energy field

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.550 align:middle line:84%
because once we start
to claim our own energy,

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.830 align:middle line:84%
decide how we want to feel, then
we're not able to be manipulated

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.860 align:middle line:90%
in the same way.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, it's
like a house of cards.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing will
start crumbling down

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.750 align:middle line:84%
because these beings are trying
to manipulate the way that we're

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.310 align:middle line:84%
feeling, the way that we are
physically, all of the things

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.105 align:middle line:84%
we're exposed to, keeping us
in a low vibrational state.

00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The whole COVID thing
happened in this frequency war

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.793 align:middle line:90%
period of tribulation.

00:04:48.793 --> 00:04:49.835 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's one thing.

00:04:49.835 --> 00:04:51.585 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: Yes, but
just all the chemicals

00:04:51.585 --> 00:04:53.220 align:middle line:84%
that are used in
our environment,

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.930 align:middle line:84%
things we're exposed to that
keep us from tapping into higher

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.030 align:middle line:84%
frequencies because
we don't even

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.703 align:middle line:90%
feel well enough to function.

00:05:00.703 --> 00:05:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To fight it.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: Yeah.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of it starts
inside and everything

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.390 align:middle line:84%
that happens at
the physical level,

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.560 align:middle line:84%
the guides say first
starts in the energetic.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So as we start to choose
those frequencies,

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.540 align:middle line:84%
we can change our
physical structure

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:84%
because we're drawn
to different things.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.207 align:middle line:84%
We're drawn to the foods
that will support us.

00:05:21.207 --> 00:05:23.270 align:middle line:84%
We're drawn to take
action in ways that will

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.110 align:middle line:90%
support that higher resonance.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And really, that's
all we need to do.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.550 align:middle line:84%
They say it's
actually quite simple.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:84%
We just make it very complicated
in the way that we think

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.100 align:middle line:90%
and the way that we feel.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And if we can just be present
and deal with this moment

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and not worry so
much about the past

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.290 align:middle line:84%
or what's coming in
the future, then we

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.990 align:middle line:84%
can make the course corrections
that we need to in order

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.050 align:middle line:84%
to maintain the frequency that
we'd like to see reflected back

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.850 align:middle line:90%
as our reality.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
absolute power of now.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
One quick question as
an aside, and then we'll

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.527 align:middle line:84%
launch into the whole notion
of duality, the nature of it,

00:05:57.527 --> 00:05:58.860 align:middle line:90%
the purpose of it, and so forth.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.170 align:middle line:84%
From your guides, is it in
the best interest of those

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.510 align:middle line:84%
hidden forces that are
population decreases?

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Because we're certainly
seeing a lot of impediment

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:84%
to procreation of all kinds
right now, whether it's

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.650 align:middle line:84%
through toxic elements
in the environment,

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.700 align:middle line:84%
toxic relationships,
toxic messaging.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.580 align:middle line:90%
It's changing.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: I think so
because just more to control.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
it gets out of hand

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.480 align:middle line:90%
and you can't control everyone.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I think, yes,
it is in their interest

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.550 align:middle line:90%
to keep us from procreating.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And also the children
who are coming in

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.020 align:middle line:84%
are coming in with a higher
level of consciousness.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you have too many
new children coming in

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.513 align:middle line:84%
with that higher level,
the game can get away.

00:06:46.513 --> 00:06:48.555 align:middle line:84%
So I think they're really
trying to control that.

00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Me too.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.870 align:middle line:90%
That's why I wanted to ask.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.940 align:middle line:84%
That's my instinct
on it as well.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's being accomplished.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.440 align:middle line:90%
We're going into decline.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.390 align:middle line:84%
In some countries,
it's insane what's

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.820 align:middle line:90%
happening in Japan and so forth.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, so good.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:02.750 align:middle line:90%
Thank you on that.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So now we're talking
about duality.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And we often think,
oh, duality is just

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.660 align:middle line:90%
a game for people on Earth.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.700 align:middle line:90%
It's only a game.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.200 align:middle line:84%
It's just here to
punish us until we

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.770 align:middle line:90%
learn better and so forth.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.200 align:middle line:84%
So one of my first
questions would be,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.660 align:middle line:84%
does this duality
exist on all dimensions

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:90%
since we are multidimensional?

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something
that's exclusively

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.375 align:middle line:84%
a hallmark of third
dimensional reality?

00:07:27.375 --> 00:07:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: So the way
my guides describe it to

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.300 align:middle line:84%
me is that we're living
in a universe of duality.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.530 align:middle line:84%
So there are other universes
where there are multiple poles,

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:90%
so it's not just dualistic.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And as you come
down in dimension,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:84%
then the frequency
gets a little heavier.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.280 align:middle line:84%
The range of that duality
also gets a little broader.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So my guides describe it
the way that they experience

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.330 align:middle line:84%
reality in the
ninth dimension is

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:84%
that you've got black, white,
and maybe two or three shades

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.740 align:middle line:90%
of gray in between.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Where we are, we've
got black, white,

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and 1,000 shades
of gray in between.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot more
variation that we experience.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And part of that just
has to do with the fact

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.630 align:middle line:84%
that we're living in
a physical reality

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.460 align:middle line:84%
where we're operating under
the illusion of separation.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.810 align:middle line:90%
We're really not separate.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.340 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible to be separate.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.350 align:middle line:84%
But for the sake of the
game, we thought, well,

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.340 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it be interesting if
we could go down into density

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.570 align:middle line:90%
and operate under the illusion?

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.740 align:middle line:84%
How would that change the way
that we experienced reality

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.780 align:middle line:84%
in the moment, how it
changed the way that we felt?

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.759 align:middle line:84%
And so we thought, OK, well,
it sounds like a good game.

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And we also have the benefit
of on this planet having

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.500 align:middle line:84%
genetic material from
thousands of worlds.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And along with that
genetic material

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.247 align:middle line:84%
comes all of the experiences
of all of the species.

00:08:52.247 --> 00:08:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good point.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: So we've got a lot
of different building blocks

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.780 align:middle line:90%
to play with.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:03.710 align:middle line:84%
So they also give the analogy
of having LEGOs to play with.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.510 align:middle line:90%
You've got 100.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.093 align:middle line:84%
What can you make
with hundreds LEGOs?

00:09:06.093 --> 00:09:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And what can you
make with 100,000?

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.410 align:middle line:84%
So we've got a lot
more subtle nuance

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.320 align:middle line:84%
that we can work with in
order to achieve goals to--

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.500 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate goal really
is ascension to increase

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.500 align:middle line:90%
our frequency.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So we've got lots of ways
to get to that destination.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So looking
then at just the nature

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.790 align:middle line:84%
of the multidimensional
humans, for example,

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.070 align:middle line:84%
we know that as we're
walking around day to day,

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.120 align:middle line:84%
we can feel the duality tugging
at us in our emotional body

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.510 align:middle line:90%
and in our lower mind.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.240 align:middle line:84%
But once you get
to-- what happens

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.600 align:middle line:84%
when you get to the finer,
higher mind of a human being?

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Does the duality
ceasefire to exist

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.340 align:middle line:84%
because that's more in
connection with soul, more

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.365 align:middle line:90%
in connection with all?

00:09:45.365 --> 00:09:46.165 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: Yes.

00:09:46.165 --> 00:09:48.270 align:middle line:84%
So they talk about
it as having--

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.630 align:middle line:90%
we have two minds.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:54.360 align:middle line:84%
We have the ego mind where
all the programs of lack,

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:90%
limitation, and separation are.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the high mind,
which is more like pure logic.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we access
that is through the heart.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.450 align:middle line:84%
It's through the
multidimensional gateway

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:06.390 align:middle line:90%
of the heart.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So when we're present, we
just have clear awareness.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And we can make
course corrections.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.540 align:middle line:84%
We have an awareness of
why things are unfolding.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.002 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're experiencing
something that is a challenge.

00:10:18.002 --> 00:10:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
when we connect

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.290 align:middle line:84%
to the heart and the
high mind, we see,

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.290 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, it's happening so
that I can learn boundaries,

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.790 align:middle line:84%
or oh, this is happening so
I can work with forgiveness.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And then we can take
action, as opposed

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.880 align:middle line:84%
to the ego mind, which is
just running like crazy.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.176 align:middle line:84%
And so we go into a contracted
state and we're defensive.

00:10:38.176 --> 00:10:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it seems
like part of the game

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:46.130 align:middle line:84%
here is really, as you said very
early on in the conversation,

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.350 align:middle line:84%
learning how to actually
occupy the moment

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:53.000 align:middle line:84%
completely seems to be a real
struggle for humanity at large.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're being encouraged
to stay in the past

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.890 align:middle line:90%
and to daydream into the future.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.860 align:middle line:84%
That's being encouraged
to be distracted

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.270 align:middle line:84%
all the time so you never
occupy your moment, right?

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: Right.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It seems if we could
occupy our moments fully,

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.010 align:middle line:84%
then we can go into that
higher mind-heart matrix

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:13.420 align:middle line:90%
of relationship, right?

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: Right.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.762 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you step out of
the game that's being played.

00:11:16.762 --> 00:11:18.530 align:middle line:84%
That's when you step
back into your power.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So I think there are
beings who are trying

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.050 align:middle line:84%
to do absolutely
everything that they can

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:26.150 align:middle line:90%
to keep us from being present.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.144 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:27.144 --> 00:11:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying, now, if we're
continuing the duality path

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:84%
here, that there's no
way around it, that's

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:84%
the nature of our home
planet and the environment

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:42.152 align:middle line:84%
we're playing in, that's our
school, it's our sandbox.

00:11:42.152 --> 00:11:45.880 align:middle line:84%
So you say that it's
very important for us

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.020 align:middle line:84%
to start integrating
the polarities.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So talk about this for a little
bit because a lot of people

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.780 align:middle line:90%
usually try to deny a polarity.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: So integration
really is releasing judgment.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And the universe
wants to bring us back

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.810 align:middle line:84%
into this awareness
of wholeness,

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.260 align:middle line:84%
that we are part of all
that is, and everything,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:84%
the dark, the light is
part of source energy.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And yes, a lot of
people, I think,

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:10.658 align:middle line:84%
just want to focus
on the positive

00:12:10.658 --> 00:12:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and want to pretend that
the negative isn't there

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.630 align:middle line:90%
or they want to push it away.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And actually, if you
desire to push it away,

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.030 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to
start creating it.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Even though you think you're
focusing on that positive thing,

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.640 align:middle line:84%
because you're still holding
judgment with the negative,

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.480 align:middle line:84%
the universe says, well,
you're not in wholeness.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:90%
So I need you to see that.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll bring
you an opportunity.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And in the process
of manifestation,

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.810 align:middle line:84%
that's really a big deal
because people will say, well,

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.810 align:middle line:84%
why am I not getting this
beautiful thing that I

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.800 align:middle line:90%
want, I keep thinking about it?

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.440 align:middle line:84%
But you want it because you
want to avoid the negative.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And so you keep
getting the negative.

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.676 align:middle line:84%
So once you can let
go of this judgement--

00:12:49.676 --> 00:12:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because there's
fear at the base of it.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: Yes.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.430 align:middle line:84%
So once you can let go
of the judgment of it,

00:12:54.430 --> 00:13:02.450 align:middle line:84%
then it doesn't mean that you
have to condone the negative.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:84%
There's some really
horrific things

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.890 align:middle line:90%
that happen on this planet.

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.850 align:middle line:84%
But it does mean that
you have to accept

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:11.610 align:middle line:84%
that it's a valid
exploration of frequency.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And it is something
that a soul can

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.770 align:middle line:84%
explore if it wants to but
doesn't mean that you have to.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, you
let go of the judgment of it,

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.510 align:middle line:84%
then you can release
that loop that you're in

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and start to move towards that
higher end of the spectrum

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.730 align:middle line:90%
that you want to experience.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as you say,
the integration process

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.240 align:middle line:84%
is simply not putting up
resistance to either side.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.230 align:middle line:90%
But that doesn't necessarily--

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:45.810 align:middle line:84%
so if something is
intrinsically unjust,

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.220 align:middle line:84%
then how do we
contend with that?

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.966 align:middle line:84%
Because there is going
to be resistance.

00:13:49.966 --> 00:13:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: So the guides
say that the soul wants

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.590 align:middle line:90%
to have different experiences.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:59.220 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that's
what the ego wants.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.470 align:middle line:84%
We can have some things
that seem unjust and unfair,

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:06.390 align:middle line:84%
but those things also
teach us about ourselves

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.400 align:middle line:84%
in many different ways,
at many different levels.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And so we will create these
situations and scenarios.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And humans will,
at the soul level,

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.600 align:middle line:90%
volunteer to be a part of that.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So the collective
can see what we

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.850 align:middle line:84%
may be doing at a very
small level to ourselves.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:27.360 align:middle line:84%
So the things that we see and
judge in the external world

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.210 align:middle line:84%
are programs and frequencies
that we judge within ourselves.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:33.845 align:middle line:84%
Now, they may have a
different mask on them.

00:14:33.845 --> 00:14:37.103 align:middle line:84%
You may be holding
an issue of control.

00:14:37.103 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And you look out
at the government

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.170 align:middle line:84%
and you see all the
control mechanisms

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.000 align:middle line:84%
that are in place with the
government, and you're angry.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.450 align:middle line:90%
And you're upset about that.

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.747 align:middle line:84%
But you may have a
control issue running

00:14:45.747 --> 00:14:48.080 align:middle line:84%
in your own personal life in
a smaller way, where you've

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.590 align:middle line:84%
got to try to get
everybody on the same page

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.310 align:middle line:84%
as you to support you so that
you can get a particular outcome

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:59.730 align:middle line:84%
or you are trying to control
and manipulate reality

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:84%
so that you get the
end result that you

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.750 align:middle line:84%
want so you don't have to
experience anything negative.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.340 align:middle line:90%
It's the same frequency.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.190 align:middle line:84%
It just looks very
different on the surface.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And so some of these
beings will put themselves

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:84%
in situations and scenarios that
seem unjust so that we can see

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.560 align:middle line:84%
that within ourselves,
where are we being unjust

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.990 align:middle line:90%
in our day-to-day reality?

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's with
a family member.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.270 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's even to ourselves.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we're not being fair.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.260 align:middle line:84%
We're being critical
and hard on ourselves.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we need to learn
from seeing that in the world.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And the collective
will change when

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.000 align:middle line:84%
we start to change at
the individual level.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that
was my next question,

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.880 align:middle line:84%
is when you're viewing
it at a collective level,

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and then, of course,
there's outrage injustice

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.800 align:middle line:84%
on a collective
level of humanity.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:54.220 align:middle line:84%
No one likes to see
oppression and cruelty.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.660 align:middle line:84%
As you say, first to
reflect and examine,

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.550 align:middle line:84%
where am I doing,
playing that stuff out?

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.610 align:middle line:84%
But then beyond
that, change never

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.460 align:middle line:84%
happens, unless there's
a choice to say,

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.360 align:middle line:90%
this doesn't serve us anymore.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.912 align:middle line:84%
There has to be blowback and
resistance at some point.

00:16:07.912 --> 00:16:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: But
there's a difference

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:10.640 align:middle line:90%
in how we go about it.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.720 align:middle line:84%
If we try to fight it, we're
going to get more of it.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.488 align:middle line:84%
If we say, this
doesn't work, and we

00:16:17.488 --> 00:16:19.530 align:middle line:84%
start to put our energy
in what we want instead--

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:22.377 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like building
from the roots up.

00:16:22.377 --> 00:16:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: Yes, that's
when change really happens.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we just stay
in conflict with the old.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
think that is so true.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for sharing that.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So are you up for
doing a channeling?

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.335 align:middle line:84%
And how shall I
address your friends?

00:16:38.335 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: So I actually
work with a lot of beings.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.580 align:middle line:84%
But the ninth dimensional
Pleiadian collective

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.080 align:middle line:84%
comes in first and foremost
when I work with the public,

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.330 align:middle line:90%
so you can call them the Ps.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, the Ps.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:47.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.713 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: That's
usually what they go by.

00:16:49.713 --> 00:16:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
maybe we can chat

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:52.155 align:middle line:90%
with the Ps for a little bit.

00:16:52.155 --> 00:16:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: Sure.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:58.110 align:middle line:90%


00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: Yes.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Hello, dear.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:84%
This is the ninth dimensional
Pleiadian collective.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.615 align:middle line:84%
And it is a pleasure
and an honor

00:17:03.615 --> 00:17:06.920 align:middle line:84%
to have the opportunity to
once again connect with you.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.434 align:middle line:84%
So how may we be of
service to you today?

00:17:09.434 --> 00:17:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, thank
you for being here.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.660 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to figure out a lot
of things here on this planet

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
we're talking about

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:21.280 align:middle line:84%
is duality and this
fine line between trying

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.740 align:middle line:90%
to integrate reality--

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:29.440 align:middle line:84%
this duality and at the same
time create higher outcomes.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.780 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people get
stuck in this, OK,

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.980 align:middle line:84%
do I just say, hey, it is what
it is, accept it for what it is?

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Or do I just go away
the other direction

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.530 align:middle line:90%
and create, create, create.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain the nuances
of living within duality

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.265 align:middle line:90%
and creating higher outcomes?

00:17:44.265 --> 00:17:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: Well, you even
explained it quite well.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So yes, you have to recognize
where you yourself are playing

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.050 align:middle line:90%
out that same frequency.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And as Wendy was saying,
the mask may be different,

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.125 align:middle line:90%
but the base frequency is there.

00:17:57.125 --> 00:17:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Especially if you're holding
judgment for something

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.360 align:middle line:84%
that you're seeing
outside of yourself,

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:84%
it exists within you
as well in the way

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:84%
that you communicate with
yourself and the view

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.420 align:middle line:84%
that you hold of
yourself and others.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:16.120 align:middle line:84%
So that is an important-- it is
a critical step in this process.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.524 align:middle line:84%
So once you've taken
a look at that,

00:18:18.524 --> 00:18:22.330 align:middle line:84%
you can forgive yourself
for holding the frequency.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:23.800 align:middle line:90%
You can acknowledge it.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Give yourself permission
to feel any emotions

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.310 align:middle line:84%
that you may have stuffed
down as a result of holding

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
that thought or
that belief system.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And once you just
observe that energy,

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:84%
you are able to allow the energy
to continue on its journey

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.030 align:middle line:84%
and to flow out as opposed
to stuffing it down.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you move
into the new frequency

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.140 align:middle line:90%
that you'd like to see instead.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.120 align:middle line:84%
So what frequency would
you like to build upon?

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you want peace.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you want
tranquility, empowerment.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And then how can
you start showing up

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.110 align:middle line:84%
in your own life holding
those resonances?

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.030 align:middle line:90%
What actions can you take?

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.000 align:middle line:84%
What shifts in your
perspective do you

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.050 align:middle line:84%
need to make in order to
stay in and sustain alignment

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:90%
with that frequency?

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And then how may you be
of service in the world

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.700 align:middle line:90%
to hold that frequency?

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.330 align:middle line:84%
What actions can you
take in the world

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:22.360 align:middle line:84%
to build that energy
in the collective?

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how change will
happen at the collective level.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Some people will feel called
to take action and build

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:34.410 align:middle line:84%
new institutions, new companies
or corporations that will

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.450 align:middle line:90%
help support the collective.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.040 align:middle line:84%
They may choose to
work in smaller ways,

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.000 align:middle line:84%
just with their local
community, to reach out and see

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.650 align:middle line:90%
who needs support.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And not everyone
will feel called

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:50.970 align:middle line:84%
to work in a particular
way on a particular topic.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:54.170 align:middle line:84%
But every one of you
has something within you

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.970 align:middle line:84%
that is a deep
calling, something

00:19:55.970 --> 00:20:00.330 align:middle line:84%
that you want to bring forward
and share with the collective.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And as you start to get quiet
and tune in for yourself

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:07.530 align:middle line:84%
about the things that
you're passionate about,

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.800 align:middle line:84%
and then what can you do for
yourself to build that energy,

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and then what actions can
you take in the community,

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:17.120 align:middle line:84%
you will have a radical
shift in the world

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.480 align:middle line:84%
when you all start taking
the time to do that within.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
take a lot of time.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:90%
That's the crazy thing.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.890 align:middle line:84%
You will say, well, I'm so busy,
I don't have time for that.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.600 align:middle line:90%
But in truth, you do.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.790 align:middle line:84%
It takes about five minutes
for you to start to tap in

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:90%
and to gain some clarity.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you can take that and
do it several times a day,

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:40.490 align:middle line:84%
you are starting to build a very
lovely foundation for yourself

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:90%
in building a new reality.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And as we were listening to your
conversation before about some

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.270 align:middle line:84%
of the control and the
manipulation going on,

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.320 align:middle line:84%
this is also how
you change that.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't take
command of your own energy,

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.290 align:middle line:84%
somebody else will
take it for you.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Is there more on that
before I launch in?

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: That's all right.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm sorry.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, it seems like
right now, I would

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.560 align:middle line:84%
love to know from
your perspective,

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.990 align:middle line:84%
looking at humanity at large,
I don't remember a time where

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:16.270 align:middle line:84%
there's this much division,
fear, blaming, victimhood.

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Never seen a circus like this
before, of these emotions

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.950 align:middle line:90%
all entangled together.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's across the board.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not just one side of
an issue feeling victimized.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's feeling
like they're the victim

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.650 align:middle line:90%
of something or another.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:32.660 align:middle line:84%
If it's not each
other, it's the system.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.215 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
what that looks

00:21:34.215 --> 00:21:35.340 align:middle line:90%
like from your perspective?

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: Well, this is what
this time was meant to be about

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.630 align:middle line:84%
because you're moving through
a sector of space, which

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.560 align:middle line:90%
is rich with photonic energy.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a start and
finish line for a cycle.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And as you are coming to
the close, this light,

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.090 align:middle line:84%
this information
is supporting you

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.030 align:middle line:84%
and healing what needs to be
healed so that you can elevate

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:59.480 align:middle line:84%
your frequency and begin the
next round as you spiral up

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.740 align:middle line:90%
in frequency.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that happens

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.590 align:middle line:84%
in this dimensional range
is that as you go higher

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.840 align:middle line:84%
in frequency, your perception
of time also accelerates.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.280 align:middle line:84%
So what you perceive to be a
24-hour day now feels more like

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.250 align:middle line:90%
about six hours.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.860 align:middle line:84%
You're getting the same
amount of data in that time.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And because you've got
this compression of time,

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:84%
you also have this recognition
of patterns that happens.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So you are seeing
the corruption,

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.090 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing what's
broken and what

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:30.870 align:middle line:90%
needs to be fixed and healed.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And yes, when
everybody is feeling

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.060 align:middle line:84%
victimized at some
level, you can

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:38.060 align:middle line:84%
start to see that, oh, here's
a pattern that everyone

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.582 align:middle line:90%
has this energy running.

00:22:39.582 --> 00:22:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the things that's

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.500 align:middle line:84%
also quite important for you
all to start recognizing,

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:84%
is that everyone has
the same issues running.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Just you may be running it
in a slightly different way.

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:84%
It might have a different
mask, as it were.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:57.460 align:middle line:84%
But when you start to listen
to what other people are saying

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.400 align:middle line:84%
instead of just reacting and
spewing out your own stuff,

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.730 align:middle line:84%
you're actually
listening to others

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.260 align:middle line:84%
and what their needs are
that you'll find, oh, well,

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.787 align:middle line:84%
I have that same
need within myself.

00:23:06.787 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a
middle ground, a place

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.730 align:middle line:90%
where we can come together.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to listen to
really hear what they're saying

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.673 align:middle line:90%
and feel that base frequency.

00:23:15.673 --> 00:23:17.340 align:middle line:84%
The other piece of
that is that it's not

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:84%
just some nameless organization
or group that you're

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.320 align:middle line:90%
connecting with individuals.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:10%
And when you do
that, you all can

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.380 align:middle line:10%
stand in a greater
posture of compassion.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.740 align:middle line:10%
And that allows you to hear
what's really being said

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.580 align:middle line:10%
and what people's needs are.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And that will also allow
you to create greater change

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.326 align:middle line:90%


00:23:41.326 --> 00:23:43.160 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
we had talked about

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.895 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of this division being
foisted upon us for purpose

00:23:46.895 --> 00:23:49.850 align:middle line:84%
to fill a handful
of beings' needs

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:51.335 align:middle line:90%
that we don't even know of.

00:23:51.335 --> 00:23:53.460 align:middle line:84%
We don't know their
identities, where they're from,

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:54.390 align:middle line:90%
or anything else.

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And so what is your perspective
looking at those forces

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and how effective
their game is and what

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.290 align:middle line:84%
they're seeing coming
up in humanity in terms

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:04.952 align:middle line:90%
of their willingness to now--

00:24:04.952 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:84%
I know they're working hard to
keep the game the way it is.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.960 align:middle line:84%
But to start backing off,
what's it going to take?

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.560 align:middle line:84%
As you said, just that,
just our awakening

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.080 align:middle line:84%
individually one on one
and they start backing off?

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: From our vantage
point, this is a fait accompli.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:17.950 align:middle line:90%
It's done.

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's done?

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:19.020 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: You will
cross the threshold.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.760 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of which path are

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.740 align:middle line:90%
you going to take to get there.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And yes, there are many
who are out there saying,

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:30.860 align:middle line:90%
this side is saying this.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.995 align:middle line:90%
This is divided over here.

00:24:32.995 --> 00:24:34.230 align:middle line:90%
You're in opposition.

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:39.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
storytelling about conflict.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.647 align:middle line:84%
But there is not nearly as much
conflict as you might think.

00:24:42.647 --> 00:24:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, like
you said earlier,

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:46.330 align:middle line:84%
we all want the same
things, essentially.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Most humans are looking
for the same things--

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.930 align:middle line:84%
some love, some respect,
some security, companionship.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're an easy
read in that way.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: Yes.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And your media, whether it's
mainstream or alternative,

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.410 align:middle line:84%
is generally focused
on the negative.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's what I wanted

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:06.680 align:middle line:90%
to get into next, the media.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: So there's a
lot of positive happening.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And we always say that if you
had a positive news report

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and you were being fed
a steady diet of that,

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.080 align:middle line:84%
you'd have a very
different planet.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.350 align:middle line:84%
But as you start to
connect with individuals

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:84%
and you start listening to
somebody who may on the surface

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:28.290 align:middle line:84%
have a different
perspective than you,

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:32.080 align:middle line:84%
then that opens the door for
you to hear things in a new way.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.630 align:middle line:84%
It opens the door for you to
reevaluate your own thoughts.

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that's also
important, that you periodically

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.760 align:middle line:90%
take inventory.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.320 align:middle line:90%
Does this belief still serve me?

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.310 align:middle line:90%
Do I still even align with it?

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:48.140 align:middle line:90%
And you'll find sometimes no.

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:49.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's important.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And some people
want to say, yes,

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:52.710 align:middle line:84%
but I've got to stick
true to my values.

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes those values were
inherent-- were inherited.

00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And they may not really support
your growth and well-being.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.780 align:middle line:84%
So you really have
to examine that

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully you're
growing and changing.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And so some of those beliefs are
also going to grow and change.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.993 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and one
of the things that's

00:26:12.993 --> 00:26:15.410 align:middle line:84%
been occurring to me along the
lines of what you're saying

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.930 align:middle line:84%
is, it's a desire
of mine to start

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:21.890 align:middle line:84%
creating real dialogue with
people who actually have

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:84%
open hearts, regardless
of what their beliefs are,

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.930 align:middle line:84%
as long as there's an open
heart, to begin talking

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:29.630 align:middle line:84%
to each other, how did
you get to this place

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and what you desire and
what your beliefs are?

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:35.280 align:middle line:84%
and what were the things
that influenced you?

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Because again, it's going
to come back to media over

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:39.770 align:middle line:90%
and over, I think.

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And so there has to be
an overarching message

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:43.550 align:middle line:90%
here about media.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: So yes.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.220 align:middle line:90%
And you can unplug from that.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.913 align:middle line:84%
But pay attention
to how you feel

00:26:49.913 --> 00:26:52.330 align:middle line:84%
and what gets triggered in you
when you hear these stories

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:53.980 align:middle line:90%
because that's the gold.

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:57.310 align:middle line:84%
When you recognize that you
go into a contracted state

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.830 align:middle line:84%
or you have anxiety,
then it's telling you

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.790 align:middle line:84%
that there is some program of
lack, limitation, or separation

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:03.590 align:middle line:90%
running.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:05.420 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you don't feel safe.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's emotionally safe.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that
where, with your partner,

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:12.160 align:middle line:84%
you're not fully
communicating because you're

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.170 align:middle line:84%
afraid your partner is not going
to understand, or maybe at work,

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.620 align:middle line:84%
you're not having a
conversation with your boss

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.480 align:middle line:90%
about compensation.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.600 align:middle line:84%
There can be lots of different
ways that you all play this out.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.450 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not
feeling safe, then

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:28.540 align:middle line:84%
start working with
that feeling of safety.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.040 align:middle line:84%
What would it feel like
to feel safe in my body?

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.650 align:middle line:84%
What would it feel like
to feel emotionally safe?

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Because once you start to take
care of that limiting belief

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.920 align:middle line:84%
within yourself, then you can
show up differently for others

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.577 align:middle line:84%
to hear their story
because you're not

00:27:42.577 --> 00:27:43.660 align:middle line:90%
triggered in the same way.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:44.535 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:44.535 --> 00:27:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that is so true,
to be clear enough

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:50.650 align:middle line:84%
yourself so that you can even
expand into someone else's story

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:51.660 align:middle line:90%
enough to hear them.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.952 align:middle line:84%
Right now it's like we
all have earplugs in.

00:27:53.952 --> 00:27:55.785 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's talking,
but nobody's listening.

00:27:55.785 --> 00:27:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: Yes, very much so.

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, I don't
want to toss this out

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.880 align:middle line:84%
because it's something
I've been thinking about.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.530 align:middle line:84%
So the notion of
reincarnation and the patterns

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.590 align:middle line:84%
of reincarnation
within humanity, first

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:17.250 align:middle line:84%
of all, what is an average cycle
after a person has left the body

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:19.150 align:middle line:84%
and taken a little
bit of time out?

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Normally, if you die of
natural causes, not someone

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.880 align:middle line:84%
who's just been shot at a young
age in battle, but normally,

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.655 align:middle line:84%
what's the average cycle before
you incarnate back again?

00:28:27.655 --> 00:28:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: Well, that
question is posed

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.363 align:middle line:90%
from a linear perspective.

00:28:30.363 --> 00:28:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:32.710 align:middle line:90%
And I know time is not linear.

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But can we even
look at it that way?

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: Yes, you can.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.730 align:middle line:84%
But let's say this, the
soul doesn't necessarily

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.760 align:middle line:84%
incarnate in a
linear progression.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.880 align:middle line:84%
It will choose the
times in history

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.410 align:middle line:84%
that serve the experience
that they want to have.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:84%
So if they really want to
work on a specific issue,

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:53.670 align:middle line:84%
they might go back 3,000
years or go ahead 5,000,

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.350 align:middle line:90%
so in all time.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:56.940 align:middle line:90%
But we understand the question.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:57.740 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, to get those
generational ancestral DNA

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.890 align:middle line:90%
patterns and so forth.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:08.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking at it in a linear
way that way just because--

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.550 align:middle line:84%
this is the question
I'm getting to.

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Do entire groups of us
start coming back in a time

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:19.820 align:middle line:84%
and starting to express pretty
much what we were before,

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:23.450 align:middle line:84%
looking to reinstantiate
the old ways of feeling

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and doing maybe old sets
of morality and so forth?

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.513 align:middle line:84%
Do we come in mass to do
this together sometimes--

00:29:28.513 --> 00:29:29.472 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: Yes, you do.

00:29:29.472 --> 00:29:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --to recreate?

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm thinking, the
way we're behaving right now

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.260 align:middle line:84%
is very reflective of
my grandpa's generation.

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: Yes, you do.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.500 align:middle line:90%
You come back.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And this specific time is a
nexus point for integration.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: Many of
you have had times

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:50.630 align:middle line:84%
in Atlantis, where you went
through a very similar situation

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:53.430 align:middle line:84%
to what you find yourselves
in, with the corruption,

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:58.400 align:middle line:84%
with the abuse of power, with
your own psychic and intuitive

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.960 align:middle line:84%
abilities, the sense
of persecution.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.530 align:middle line:84%
So you will come back as a
group so that you can interact.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:08.180 align:middle line:84%
This is a special time
because of the nature

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:09.980 align:middle line:84%
of your reality with
the internet, the way

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:11.820 align:middle line:84%
that you have the
ability to travel.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.150 align:middle line:84%
If you think back 50,
60 years ago, people

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:15.860 align:middle line:90%
didn't travel in the same way.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.060 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have as much
interaction with people,

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.430 align:middle line:84%
so their group was
much, much smaller.

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So this specific
time, you will have

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:25.220 align:middle line:84%
beings who will
show up that you've

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:28.340 align:middle line:84%
had for many different
lifetimes to work

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.920 align:middle line:84%
through that karma,
if you will, to work

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.080 align:middle line:84%
through those lessons that
did not get integrated

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.292 align:middle line:84%
in another lifetime
in a different setup.

00:30:36.292 --> 00:30:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So you thought, well, let's
try it again here and now

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.490 align:middle line:84%
on a slightly different
setup and hopefully where

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:44.470 align:middle line:90%
we see all going actually.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:46.970 align:middle line:84%
You all are going to go through
this process of integration.

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:48.790 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
release the judgments

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.420 align:middle line:90%
that you held in other times.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:54.440 align:middle line:84%
But yes, you will
come in as groups.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.456 align:middle line:84%
In the past, the groups
were not as large.

00:30:57.456 --> 00:30:59.478 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:59.478 --> 00:31:02.230 align:middle line:84%
So then that would
bring me square

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:05.110 align:middle line:84%
to the center of the
question, which is--

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:06.740 align:middle line:90%
and I see the value--

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.940 align:middle line:90%
I see the value in this.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:11.120 align:middle line:84%
But it seems on a
more prosaic level,

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.130 align:middle line:90%
yes, the Atlanteans are back.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:14.370 align:middle line:90%
I interview a lot of them.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I'm one of them.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:20.110 align:middle line:84%
But on a more prosaic
level, grandpa's generation

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:23.170 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of
simplicity, the desire

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:26.620 align:middle line:84%
for simplicity,
standard morality,

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and such that they embodied
maybe 50, 60 years ago,

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.990 align:middle line:84%
that seems to be coming
back around for review again

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:38.800 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps because
we've lost our way a bit

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.185 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what
we're accepting as OK.

00:31:42.185 --> 00:31:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: So there's a
bit of a middle ground that

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:47.572 align:middle line:84%
needs to happen because that
generation suppressed a lot.

00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, they did.

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:51.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying this is
all good by any means,

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.790 align:middle line:90%
certainly with women, not--

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: Yes, they suppressed
the way that they felt.

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:57.280 align:middle line:84%
They didn't
communicate about that.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Then there was suppression
of different individuals,

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:02.830 align:middle line:90%
different sects.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And here, everyone is
going to the other extreme

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:07.880 align:middle line:90%
where there's overexpression.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.960 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to find your
way come to a middle ground

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.140 align:middle line:84%
where, no, we're not going quite
that far where we were really

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.930 align:middle line:84%
repressed and now we're
not going to a place

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:20.150 align:middle line:90%
where we're overexpressing.

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes, so you'll look to the past.

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:24.160 align:middle line:84%
You'll look to some
of that energy.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.520 align:middle line:90%
And you'll feel into it.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:30.130 align:middle line:84%
But you will blend
it with some--

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: More what the
times are calling for.

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:34.715 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: Yes, in a
healthier, balanced way.

00:32:34.715 --> 00:32:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, now
that makes sense.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And what about the
place of the feminine

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:44.490 align:middle line:84%
within this whole awakening and
this wonderful energy flowing

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:48.720 align:middle line:84%
through the cosmos, demanding
that we go to higher, more

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.170 align:middle line:90%
fine levels of our self?

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Where's the feminine
in all this?

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.223 align:middle line:84%
Because there are a
lot of times we're

00:32:53.223 --> 00:32:55.835 align:middle line:84%
feeling like it's just not
being given much of a chance.

00:32:55.835 --> 00:32:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: It's front and
center because in the process

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:02.160 align:middle line:84%
of manifestation itself, the
feminine always comes first

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.000 align:middle line:90%
in a linear perceived reality.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And you start first with
the feminine internally.

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.610 align:middle line:84%
That's the rooting
around and seeing

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:14.110 align:middle line:90%
what frequencies are available.

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:15.630 align:middle line:90%
You're working in the void.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:16.820 align:middle line:90%
You're examining.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.070 align:middle line:90%
And then you make a selection.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:19.237 align:middle line:90%
You move into the masculine.

00:33:19.237 --> 00:33:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And then you start to
emit that energetically.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And then you move back
into the feminine.

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:28.920 align:middle line:84%
But in the external,
you are viewing

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.250 align:middle line:84%
what is out in front of you
and what is coming to you.

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you move
into the masculine

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:37.080 align:middle line:84%
again and make a selection
and interact with it.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:40.160 align:middle line:84%
So there's this constant
flow between the feminine

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.360 align:middle line:90%
and the masculine.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.310 align:middle line:84%
On the planet
right now, you have

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:47.100 align:middle line:84%
been working with what we
will call the lower masculine.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And even the feminine has been
the lower expression of it.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So the divine feminine,
the higher aspect,

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:59.930 align:middle line:84%
is first in being
resurrected, if you will.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And again, as you work
at the individual level

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and you start understanding
the divine feminine within each

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:08.179 align:middle line:84%
and every one of
you, it will help

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.610 align:middle line:84%
you to start to see that
in the external world

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:14.370 align:middle line:84%
that the feminine is honored
more, that stillness,

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:19.520 align:middle line:84%
that calmness, that
creative energy,

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:24.199 align:middle line:84%
not in an active, busy way,
but in a very focused form.

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:27.120 align:middle line:84%
That is the feminine
where it's very focused.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.159 align:middle line:84%
And so as you're learning
to harness this energy

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:33.860 align:middle line:84%
within yourself, you
can start to see it

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.940 align:middle line:90%
elevated in the external world.

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And again, like with all things,
as we were discussing earlier,

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.480 align:middle line:84%
it first starts as an
inside job in order

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.710 align:middle line:90%
to see it in the external world.

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:47.100 align:middle line:84%
You'll start to see it
created and honored more.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.239 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to start honoring
it yourselves and where are you

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:54.179 align:middle line:84%
not honoring that internal
softness with yourself,

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:56.190 align:middle line:84%
where are you not
nurturing yourself.

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
what gender you are.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.750 align:middle line:84%
You're not even honoring
it within yourself.

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:04.090 align:middle line:84%
So how can you expect it to be
honored in the external world?

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you see a time
that's not that far distant,

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:11.120 align:middle line:84%
where the feminine can
start coming forward

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.810 align:middle line:84%
in a more obvious way, in
positions of leadership

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:19.800 align:middle line:84%
of all kinds, in all
aspects, as it should be,

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.590 align:middle line:84%
standing alongside male and
female alongside each other?

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: Probably within
the next five to six years,

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.150 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see it in
a much more dramatic way.

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:31.480 align:middle line:84%
But that also has to do with the
shift in how you are setting up

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.620 align:middle line:90%
your institutions.

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:34.850 align:middle line:90%
That's coming.

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And you asked Wendy at the
beginning about frequency wars.

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:42.830 align:middle line:84%
At the end of your frequency
wars, around 2026--

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:46.810 align:middle line:84%
and we still see it as a very
strong probability midsummer

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.700 align:middle line:90%
to late 2026--

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.410 align:middle line:84%
the probability of open
contact is quite strong.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And once you have
this open contact,

00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:01.000 align:middle line:84%
it is going to help you
all to really question

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.930 align:middle line:84%
a lot of your natural resources,
your place in the universe.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And once you do that,
then it's a game changer.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.530 align:middle line:84%
You want to shift
your institutions.

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:15.130 align:middle line:84%
You want to start
building society

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:19.420 align:middle line:84%
in a new way that's a
much healthier way, a much

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:20.720 align:middle line:90%
more balanced way.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And we see that coming at
the end of the frequency

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.920 align:middle line:90%
wars in 2026.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And so this brings
us to the subject

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.020 align:middle line:90%
of the young people being born.

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of them just
appear to be so incredibly lit

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:35.800 align:middle line:84%
up and smart and much
more awareness and even

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.400 align:middle line:90%
distant memory.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And are these essentially us
just incarnating human souls?

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Are these other
kinds of souls that

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.270 align:middle line:84%
are coming in in human
form at this time

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:52.350 align:middle line:84%
to perhaps be here for
ushering in this shift?

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:56.932 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: It's a bit of a mixed
bag, and so is your generation.

00:36:56.932 --> 00:36:58.250 align:middle line:90%
It's a bit of a mixed bag.

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:01.580 align:middle line:84%
But children are coming in with
more light, more information.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Part of that has to do
with the parents just

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.645 align:middle line:84%
being able to hold more
light and more information.

00:37:05.645 --> 00:37:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is also why
your children are so

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:15.760 align:middle line:84%
attacked by the chemicals that
are being put into them when

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.800 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at all
of the medications,

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:22.430 align:middle line:84%
when you're looking at
the chemicals in food,

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:25.160 align:middle line:84%
because these are amazing
little beings of light.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And they're coming in with
so much knowledge and wisdom

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.520 align:middle line:90%
to share with the collective.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And so everything
is being done to try

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.420 align:middle line:84%
to suppress that light
at the physical level.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And then as they grow older, at
the emotional and mental levels

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.420 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:43.380 align:middle line:84%
But that is in part why
they are so targeted,

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.550 align:middle line:84%
because they are
bringing so much light.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And many of them have
been here before.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.970 align:middle line:84%
They are from previous
generations, you asked.

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes souls will come in and
turn around and go right back

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:56.550 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:58.300 align:middle line:90%
So there's no time lag.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.720 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes the soul might wait.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, right now,
probably not more than 20 years

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.950 align:middle line:84%
because things are
changing so rapidly,

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.070 align:middle line:84%
they want to get
right back into it.

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:10.210 align:middle line:84%
If you'd asked us
thousand years ago,

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:13.020 align:middle line:84%
they might wait a couple
hundred years to come back.

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.730 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on what
the soul wants to learn.

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:17.080 align:middle line:90%
So that's your linear.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, interesting.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And so would that also
account for the instant--

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:25.410 align:middle line:84%
the huge increase in the
instance of young people

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:29.217 align:middle line:90%
taking their lives now?

00:38:29.217 --> 00:38:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: That's a
whole other conversation

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:34.860 align:middle line:84%
because a soul
chooses its exit plan.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And whether you die of old age,
or an accident, or suicide,

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.620 align:middle line:90%
it is always the soul's choice.

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.830 align:middle line:84%
The soul will choose
to do everything

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.920 align:middle line:84%
that it wants to
do with the setup

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.760 align:middle line:90%
that it has for that lifetime.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.350 align:middle line:90%
So it is a soul choice.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:58.210 align:middle line:90%
And there is a hard out.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And there may be a
few other exit ramps

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.830 align:middle line:90%
before that the soul can take.

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:04.650 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it's just
that the soul came

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:06.250 align:middle line:90%
for a short amount of time.

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:09.810 align:middle line:84%
But how a soul chooses
to leave will also

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:12.000 align:middle line:84%
impact those that
are left behind.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And so a soul may
come in saying,

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:17.340 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm going to take my
life because that's really

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.210 align:middle line:84%
all I needed to do
in this lifetime.

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:21.960 align:middle line:90%
But it will impact the parents.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And it will teach them
tremendous lessons

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.840 align:middle line:84%
and help them to work and
maybe go off on a new path

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.750 align:middle line:84%
that they would not have gone
off on before without that

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:31.980 align:middle line:90%
as a life experience.

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So there are many,
many levels and layers.

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:36.610 align:middle line:90%
It is very subtly nuanced.

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:38.305 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I understand.

00:39:38.305 --> 00:39:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: But oftentimes
it is to help to wake

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.500 align:middle line:90%
those that are left behind up.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, thank you.

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And my final
question to you will

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:50.370 align:middle line:84%
be, if you can reflect
back to us-- as I said,

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:53.120 align:middle line:84%
when you're looking at
all this fear and division

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.570 align:middle line:90%
and such, that's one glimpse.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us now in
reverse, the glimpse

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.960 align:middle line:84%
that you see where
you really are seeing

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.760 align:middle line:84%
some positive shifts
in light rising

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.855 align:middle line:84%
and what that looks like,
where we are learning?

00:40:04.855 --> 00:40:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: Well, we
actually see you there.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.360 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is that
you can't see yourself.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.650 align:middle line:84%
We're having a conversation
with you right here, right now.

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:14.850 align:middle line:84%
That would not have
happened 15 years ago.

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:15.840 align:middle line:90%
20 years ago.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.575 align:middle line:90%
So light is rising.

00:40:17.575 --> 00:40:18.950 align:middle line:84%
You just aren't
seeing it perhaps

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:21.390 align:middle line:84%
at the scale that you'd
like to see it at.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:25.400 align:middle line:84%
But that scale is going
to be exponential.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:29.505 align:middle line:84%
So the next several years will
be very important for you all.

00:40:29.505 --> 00:40:30.890 align:middle line:90%
We're very excited.

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:32.950 align:middle line:84%
There are many other
beings who are present

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:34.630 align:middle line:84%
observing what's
happening because this

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.580 align:middle line:84%
is a very special
and very sacred

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:38.840 align:middle line:84%
time that you all
are going through.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:41.780 align:middle line:84%
We know in the midst of the
chaos, it doesn't feel like it.

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.450 align:middle line:84%
But there is so
much chaos that's

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:45.760 align:middle line:84%
stirring the pot that it's
giving you the opportunity

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.640 align:middle line:84%
to let go of the old in a way
that perhaps if there wasn't

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.060 align:middle line:90%
as much chaos, you wouldn't do.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:50.935 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:40:50.935 --> 00:40:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: So we would say, as
you get to 2026, whether contact

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.400 align:middle line:84%
happens or not,
all right, you all

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:06.580 align:middle line:84%
will have an awakening of
sorts over what has just

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:10.040 align:middle line:84%
transpired to say these things
are no longer working over here.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.150 align:middle line:90%
We need something better.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:12.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's start building.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.090 align:middle line:90%
Let's put our minds together.

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Because right now, if you
look at your governments,

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:17.720 align:middle line:90%
it's more of the same.

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the same people just
being shuffled around.

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:23.720 align:middle line:84%
You've got a lot of very
bright people on your planet,

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.860 align:middle line:84%
so it's getting those minds
together more at the grassroots

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:29.060 align:middle line:84%
level and not trying to
work from the top-down

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.580 align:middle line:90%
but the bottom-up.

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And you won't find that you
have as much resistance in order

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:38.800 align:middle line:84%
to get new ideas
out, that people

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.590 align:middle line:84%
will be hungry for, that
they'll be collaborating

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:44.110 align:middle line:90%
in new and exciting ways.

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:47.470 align:middle line:84%
You'll be thinking
about the world

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:50.980 align:middle line:84%
and your place in the galaxy
within the solar system

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.930 align:middle line:84%
in a new way, regardless of
whether contact happens or not.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:55.930 align:middle line:84%
We're pretty sure it's
going to come down

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:57.320 align:middle line:90%
in the next several years.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:01.100 align:middle line:90%
But it's very fluid.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.315 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:42:02.315 --> 00:42:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: And that goes into
a whole other conversation

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:06.710 align:middle line:84%
about the nature
and reality of time.

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:09.250 align:middle line:84%
You're just moving from
now moment to now moment.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And somebody that is
listening to this now,

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.090 align:middle line:84%
three months from now might
be on a different now moment

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:17.860 align:middle line:84%
than somebody else
who is listening

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:18.920 align:middle line:90%
to the very same thing.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.900 align:middle line:84%
So their realities
can be different.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:24.786 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part, it's
a very strong probability.

00:42:24.786 --> 00:42:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And there is a--
it's interesting

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:30.390 align:middle line:84%
being on the planet
right now, that there

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:36.090 align:middle line:84%
is almost a deep sadness
among people at large that

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.160 align:middle line:84%
has occurred because
of the division

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and separation from each other,
where families have split apart

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:43.830 align:middle line:84%
and aren't speaking to
each other, friendships,

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:45.510 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's a good
thing, to yearn for something

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.790 align:middle line:84%
more connected and feel a
sadness rather than righteous

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:55.680 align:middle line:84%
indignation which
we felt in the past

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.085 align:middle line:84%
like we were justified
in judging each other.

00:42:58.085 --> 00:43:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: Well, that is
your core wound, separation

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.770 align:middle line:90%
from source.

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And so you are playing that
out as you separate yourself

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:06.640 align:middle line:90%
from others.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling that
pain and that longing

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:10.620 align:middle line:84%
and much of what
has been suppressed

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:15.840 align:middle line:84%
in terms of you really opening
up and being your true divine

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:16.780 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:20.040 align:middle line:84%
There is a connection
that you are establishing,

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:23.880 align:middle line:84%
a deeper connection with the
spark of the divine within you.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, it's
playing out in a way

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:30.170 align:middle line:84%
that may look painful
and challenging

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:31.200 align:middle line:90%
in the external world.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.680 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's getting you
to look at the internal wounds

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.710 align:middle line:90%
that you hold.

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And that can help you
so that you can go back

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.970 align:middle line:90%
to that relationship.

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:41.352 align:middle line:84%
And you can hold a greater
sense of compassion and work

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:43.310 align:middle line:84%
with forgiveness, forgiving
yourself, forgiving

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:48.810 align:middle line:84%
the other person and learning
to communicate in new ways.

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:50.085 align:middle line:90%
So it is teaching you.

00:43:50.085 --> 00:43:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we say
there's so much light.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.200 align:middle line:84%
But you all can't
necessarily see it

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.470 align:middle line:84%
because you've
stirred the pot a bit.

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And you're just
clearing that out.

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you get a little
further down the line

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:06.923 align:middle line:84%
and not that much further,
you're going to feel--

00:44:06.923 --> 00:44:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Feel more obvious.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: --refreshed.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, wonderful.

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're looking
for that refreshment.

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much for
speaking with us today

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:15.330 align:middle line:90%
about all of this.

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And we'll bid you farewell
and come back to Wendy.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:22.955 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: It's been
our pleasure, dear.

00:44:22.955 --> 00:44:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, Wendy,
wow, the time has flown.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:30.710 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to ask
you if there's anything

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.880 align:middle line:84%
you saw in there that you
want to make comment on,

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.165 align:middle line:84%
and if not, to do a little
light activation for us.

00:44:35.165 --> 00:44:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: I think we'll
just go ahead and do

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:37.915 align:middle line:90%
the light activation.

00:44:37.915 --> 00:44:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's do that.

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.720 align:middle line:10%
>>KENNEDY: So I think there are
a couple of different levels

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:45.140 align:middle line:10%
that we can get
with the activation.

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.460 align:middle line:10%
One is empowerment.

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Deciding what you want in
terms of how you want to feel.

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:54.080 align:middle line:10%
Opening up to intuition
is the other thing

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.240 align:middle line:10%
that they were showing me.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.430 align:middle line:10%
And deepening that
sense of connection

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:middle line:10%
with self, with others,
with the planet,

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.781 align:middle line:10%
and with your stellar
family if you want to.

00:45:03.781 --> 00:45:04.614 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:45:04.614 --> 00:45:06.075 align:middle line:90%
So let's go for it.

00:45:06.075 --> 00:45:06.875 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: OK.

00:45:06.875 --> 00:45:10.760 align:middle line:90%

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:25.150 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:28.880 align:middle line:84%
They don't always give me
translations for stuff.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.780 align:middle line:84%
But there's extra energy
that was in there for safety.

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.670 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
aren't feeling safe.

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:37.160 align:middle line:84%
So that was also in
there, that you were safe,

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.222 align:middle line:84%
that you are loved,
that you are supported.

00:46:40.222 --> 00:46:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, my dear.

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:45.110 align:middle line:84%
It's just so
mesmerizing as well.

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:47.240 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the
energy, of course.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.640 align:middle line:90%
But it is mesmerizing in itself.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.110 align:middle line:84%

this come out of you?

much for joining us today.

00:46:56.322 --> 00:46:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think these were just
wonderful messages for the time

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.860 align:middle line:90%
from both you and from the Ps.

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:01.670 align:middle line:90%

you for having me.
