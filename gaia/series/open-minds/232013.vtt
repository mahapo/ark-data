00:00:18.678 --> 00:00:20.720 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: One
of the audience favorites

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.620 align:middle line:10%
at the GaiaSphere is founder
of the Quantum Academy,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.720 align:middle line:10%
Espen Wold-Jensen, known for his
work in using breath as our path

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.200 align:middle line:10%
to awakening consciousness
and regenerating our bodies.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.460 align:middle line:84%
He's here with us today to
share his quantum breathwork,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.658 align:middle line:90%
which can change your life.

00:00:35.658 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to meet you.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.600 align:middle line:84%
I've heard wonderful
things about you.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>> ESPEN WOLD-JENSEN: It's
so great to be with you.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.540 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so much.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.373 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you have
an interesting story.

00:00:42.373 --> 00:00:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And for people who haven't
attended the Gaia Sphere

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.640 align:middle line:84%
and may not already
know your story,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.160 align:middle line:84%
let's get into how breath
literally saved your life.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Absolutely.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.620 align:middle line:10%
I came from Norway to Australia.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.340 align:middle line:10%
I moved to Australia in 2005.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:10%
And in 2006, I had a motorcycle
accident and broke both my legs

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.010 align:middle line:10%
and fractured part of
my pelvis and my spine.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.810 align:middle line:10%
Got taken to a hospital and
they put 14 different pieces

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:10%
of metal in me-- bolts and
pins and plates and screws.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You must be fun
going through security.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: I
actually never went off.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.550 align:middle line:90%
OK, sorry, to interrupt you.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.110 align:middle line:90%
I was just imagining it.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: I thought it
was going to go off like crazy.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:90%
Never went off.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:90%
So I had the surgery.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Got myself back on my feet
after a couple of months.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I went
back to the hospital

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.210 align:middle line:84%
in Melbourne,
Australia, a year later

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.610 align:middle line:90%
to take the metal out in 2007.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.852 align:middle line:84%
And a few weeks
after the surgery,

00:01:34.852 --> 00:01:36.310 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize
what had happened,

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.950 align:middle line:84%
but I realized when
I looked at my leg,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.450 align:middle line:84%
I had horrible blood and
pus traveling down the leg.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the
hospital, got it swabbed,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.310 align:middle line:84%
sent off to pathology, and it
came back as a staph infection.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, boy.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Yeah.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:90%
So that was---

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Had you picked
that up during surgery

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.990 align:middle line:90%
at the hospital?

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Yeah.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So I got that from
the surgery and when

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:90%
they took all the metal out.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And I tried everything I did
everything that I was told,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:84%
took all the drugs and saw
the doctors and the nurses

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and went to all the hospitals
and all the appointments

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:84%
For a year and two
months after the surgery,

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.610 align:middle line:84%
I fought for my life
with the staph infection

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:90%
spreading through my body.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.530 align:middle line:90%
I lost 15 kilos.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And one day in 2008 when
the surgeon walked in,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.050 align:middle line:84%
he looked at me and he said,
the infection is spreading.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.290 align:middle line:84%
He said we have to
amputate your leg.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:84%
He said if we can cut your
leg off from the right hip

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.110 align:middle line:90%
and down, we can save your life.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.575 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't do that,
then you're going to die.

00:02:26.575 --> 00:02:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
pretty intense.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.530 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you have
staph infection moving

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.070 align:middle line:84%
through your body for over
that long a period of time?

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.653 align:middle line:84%
What are the effects
of it internally?

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:36.945 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: The thing
with staph infections is they

00:02:36.945 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:84%
don't really respond
to antibiotics.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And so even though
that was the case,

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:84%
they were still giving me
strong doses and large amounts

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.750 align:middle line:90%
of broad spectrum antibiotics.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So it was literally
annihilating my immune system.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like
killing bacteria

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:90%
which we need for good health.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we have more bacteria
in the body than we have cells.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.380 align:middle line:90%
But at the same time--

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Not
killing the bad guys.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Exactly.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.640 align:middle line:90%
So, long story short--

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did it affect your--
or it had to have affected

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.880 align:middle line:90%
your organs.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.005 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Everything.

00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, from what I can feel,
I knew that I was dying.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Now I didn't have a lot of
body fat, but I lost 15 kilos.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I felt weak, I felt tired,
I looked like I was dying.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, one day when the
surgeon looked me in the eyes,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.160 align:middle line:84%
he looked at his
charts and said,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.360 align:middle line:90%
the infection is spreading.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.318 align:middle line:84%
We have to take your leg,
otherwise you'll die.

00:03:21.318 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And first time in my
life, spirit came through.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, let's talk about
the good part now when spirit

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.660 align:middle line:90%
came through.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: As I
say to my students now,

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I was very blessed to almost die
in hospital twice because I got

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.060 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to learn
how to heal myself.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.838 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not saying if you
have a motorcycle accident,

00:03:39.838 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:90%
don't go to the hospital.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.980 align:middle line:84%
You need to go to the hospital,
like the ambulance saved

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:43.660 align:middle line:90%
my life.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.780 align:middle line:84%
But I say there's a big
difference between health

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.300 align:middle line:90%
care and sick care.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.180 align:middle line:84%
When spirit came through, it
was the first time in my life

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.020 align:middle line:84%
where I felt something within
me that felt like a home.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And I had lived in fear
for a year and two months

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.340 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.740 align:middle line:84%
But when that came through,
it said, go home and breathe.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.995 align:middle line:84%
Spirit, my higher
self, universe, God,

00:04:03.995 --> 00:04:05.620 align:middle line:84%
call it whatever you
want, came through

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:90%
and said go home and breathe.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.427 align:middle line:84%
And my brain said, what
do you mean breathe?

00:04:11.427 --> 00:04:12.760 align:middle line:90%
I've been breathing all my life.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.200 align:middle line:90%
Can you give me--

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Well, how did
you them to let you out and go

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.420 align:middle line:90%
home?

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.128 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Well, as soon as
the surgeon walked out the door,

00:04:18.128 --> 00:04:20.540 align:middle line:84%
I ripped the intravenous
out of my arms and I left.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.160 align:middle line:90%
I had such a knowing in me.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And I had tried everything for a
year and two months-- everything

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:90%
that I was told.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, you had no doubt
at that time that what you were

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.600 align:middle line:90%
hearing would save your life?

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Or did you say, I'm going
to give it a shot because it

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.520 align:middle line:90%
feels real to me?

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't,
I've done everything?

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Which one was it?

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: It was both.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.720 align:middle line:84%
But it was actually the
point of inner knowing.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:84%
I call it an inner standing,
not an understanding.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.640 align:middle line:90%
And it was so real and so deep.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.367 align:middle line:90%
And so I felt at peace.

00:04:49.367 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:84%
For the first time in
a year and two months,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.590 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't in fear anymore.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.173 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you went home
and you started breathing.

00:04:56.173 --> 00:04:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's start--
now we're getting

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.710 align:middle line:84%
into the subject of quantum
reality, the non-material world,

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.210 align:middle line:90%
and breathwork combined.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.410 align:middle line:84%
So we know the world is
non-material in nature.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.150 align:middle line:84%
We know you and I are
non-material in nature.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So talk about what breath is
in this non-material world.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: It's
a wonderful question.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.150 align:middle line:84%
As I said, the first thing
that happens when you're born

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.890 align:middle line:90%
is you take your first breath--

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:20.990 align:middle line:90%
the inhale.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And then the last
thing you do before you

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.895 align:middle line:84%
leave this human experience is
you take your last breath, which

00:05:24.895 --> 00:05:25.870 align:middle line:90%
is the exhale.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.650 align:middle line:84%
So breath and life
is the same thing.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, breath and
spirit is the same thing.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting when you
study the ancient phenomena

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.950 align:middle line:84%
of what the ancient
yogis were talking

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.670 align:middle line:90%
about for thousands of years.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And also in many Indigenous
languages around the world,

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.490 align:middle line:84%
including in Australia,
where I reside at the moment,

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.990 align:middle line:84%
breath and spirit,
the word for air,

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.630 align:middle line:84%
breath, and spirit
is the same word.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Respiration.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Exactly right.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And so what I believe is
that we're all walking around

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.530 align:middle line:84%
with the superpower hidden
right underneath our nose,

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.650 align:middle line:84%
and no one's really taught
anyone how to use it.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.510 align:middle line:84%
But then we have the researcher
Wim Hof and the ancient yogis

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.110 align:middle line:84%
and many, many
others that are now

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.870 align:middle line:84%
starting to come back where
science is finally catching up

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.650 align:middle line:84%
on what spirituality has been
teaching for thousands of years,

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:84%
that breath is
indeed a superpower.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And we know its effects on
autonomic nervous system,

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:84%
default mode network, and
many other things, of course.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How do you blend the
science of the quantum field

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.770 align:middle line:90%
in with the breathwork?

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.927 align:middle line:84%
Why is this called
quantum breathwork?

00:06:19.927 --> 00:06:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: It's
a great question.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.210 align:middle line:90%
I had that as an experience.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So I left the hospital, I went
home and I set up on my bed.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was just waiting
for an instruction

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.030 align:middle line:84%
because I'd been
given an instruction

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.950 align:middle line:90%
and I wanted to know what to do.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.250 align:middle line:90%
I was told to breathe.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I was told to breathe in
and out through the mouth,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and to move the energy from the
base of the spine to the crown.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.050 align:middle line:90%
Now I didn't know what that was.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.050 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know about the
torus field at the time.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.630 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know about the
divine masculine/feminine

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and the electromagnetic
and all the aspects that

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.600 align:middle line:84%
make up who we are, as you
said, as a non-physical being.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.640 align:middle line:84%
But I kept on breathing
very extensively

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.780 align:middle line:90%
and I passed out on my bed.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I'm not surprised.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: But I woke up
and I had a smile on my face

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.340 align:middle line:90%
and I felt wonderful.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing with the infection
is that I had a hole in my skin

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.100 align:middle line:84%
on the right hip for
a year and two months.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And I would notice
that when I was

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:84%
eating unhealthy or stressing
or sleeping properly,

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.200 align:middle line:90%
that hole would get bigger.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.880 align:middle line:90%
So I knew what made it worse.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, if I
would do a fast and pray

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.620 align:middle line:84%
and meditate and
eat clean and so on,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.980 align:middle line:90%
the hole would get smaller.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And when I woke up
the following morning

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.940 align:middle line:84%
after doing the
breathwork twice,

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.622 align:middle line:84%
the hole had shrunk more than
I had seen in over a year.

00:07:30.622 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought,
wow, I don't know

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:84%
what that was, but I'm going to
do it again because I feel great

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and it's certainly
doing something.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Second time, third
time I'm doing it,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.880 align:middle line:90%
emotions are coming up.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.660 align:middle line:84%
When I was young, my
brother passed away.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.240 align:middle line:84%
I found him passed away
in his bed when I was five

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.170 align:middle line:90%
and he was only a baby.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm breathing,
that was-- of course,

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.870 align:middle line:84%
the issues are stored
in the tissues.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And so, as I'm breathing
the second day,

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.397 align:middle line:84%
these visions of finding
a blue baby are coming up.

00:07:58.397 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And the visions of me being
bullied as a child at school

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:01.590 align:middle line:90%
is coming up.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know why,
but I trusted the process.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.150 align:middle line:90%
And I kept on breathing.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I
was releasing trauma,

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.490 align:middle line:84%
stored trauma in my cells,
in the subconscious mind.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And long story short,
I had the infection

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.790 align:middle line:90%
for a year and two months.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.450 align:middle line:84%
I tried everything--
everything that I

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.410 align:middle line:84%
was told, looking outside
of myself for healing.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And in 3 and 1/2 weeks, I
healed myself using the power

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:23.930 align:middle line:90%
of breath.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.290 align:middle line:84%
So to answer your
question, I truly

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.170 align:middle line:84%
do believe that,
as Max Planck said,

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:33.929 align:middle line:84%
we're made up of 99.9% pure
nonphysical consciousness.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:37.309 align:middle line:84%
This is how we can tap into
the consciousness using breath.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.789 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is a great tool--
many other great tools.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:41.169 align:middle line:90%
But breath is the portal.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I would like to know
almost on a mechanical science

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.498 align:middle line:90%
level, why that is.

00:08:46.498 --> 00:08:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Great question.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:48.870 align:middle line:90%
I love this question.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.450 align:middle line:84%
So what we now know is that the
breath and oxygen, including

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:84%
CO2, the combination of the
two, has a direct effect

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.210 align:middle line:84%
upon the autonomic
nervous system.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.437 align:middle line:84%
So we have the sympathetic
nervous system-- fight

00:08:59.437 --> 00:09:01.770 align:middle line:84%
or flight, and then the
parasympathetic nervous system--

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:02.745 align:middle line:90%
rest and digest.

00:09:02.745 --> 00:09:04.370 align:middle line:84%
These are the two
parts of the branches

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.030 align:middle line:90%
of the autonomic nervous system.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Ancient yogis have been showing
this for a very long time, how

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:12.050 align:middle line:84%
we can have power over our
autonomic nervous system

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.330 align:middle line:90%
using our breath.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So it has to do
with oxygen and CO2.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.970 align:middle line:84%
But also science has shown now
that you will literally change

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:20.930 align:middle line:90%
your brain when you breathe.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:84%
There was a study
out of Oslo in 2013

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.730 align:middle line:84%
that showed you actually have
a change to the gene expression

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.510 align:middle line:90%
using yoga and breathwork.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:84%
They had 111 changes
to the gene using

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:36.010 align:middle line:84%
yoga and breathwork and only 38
in the test and control group.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.190 align:middle line:90%
So that's one way.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And the other way is, of
course, also downregulating

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:43.540 align:middle line:84%
the stress response or the
sympathetic nerve response.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Downregulating the
default mode network

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.440 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, which has to
do with ego and survival,

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.020 align:middle line:84%
often overthinking, beta
brainwaves, that sort of stuff,

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.000 align:middle line:84%
but also accessing
the super conscious.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:84%
I think this is an
interesting conversation

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.900 align:middle line:84%
to have-- activating the
pineal and pituitary circuit

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.520 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.320 align:middle line:90%
That was a lot.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's a lot.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And shall we go
there now or shall

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:84%
we go to the energy
center system, which

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.180 align:middle line:84%
has to do with chakras
interference patterns

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:84%
or should we hop right
to the pituitary?

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: I think it's
great to cover the energy

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.240 align:middle line:90%
centers first.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So when I finished
clinical practice in 2016,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.740 align:middle line:90%
I was burnt out and exhausted.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to take some
time out to, quote unquote,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.940 align:middle line:90%
"find myself."

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.592 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, what better to
do than to go on a journey

00:10:30.592 --> 00:10:33.640 align:middle line:84%
into the jungle in Peru
and sit with the earth,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.640 align:middle line:84%
be present, meditate,
and so on and so forth?

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So I took a trip into
the Sacred Valley.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And after a 30-day fast, I did
20 days on water and 10 days

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.820 align:middle line:90%
on just eating herbs.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.420 align:middle line:84%
I started having
some very interesting

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.520 align:middle line:90%
spiritual experiences.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I would think you're
too associated with the body

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:90%
by that time.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Exactly.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was good because I
needed to purify myself.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.520 align:middle line:84%
I had been in fight or flight
in sympathetic dominance,

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and most people are in
sympathetic dominance.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.780 align:middle line:90%
This is part of the problem.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That is a chronic
issue for society at large

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.680 align:middle line:90%
globally.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Absolutely.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
breath can actually

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.100 align:middle line:84%
change that, which we'll
come to in a moment.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.680 align:middle line:90%
So I was in Peru.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:84%
I was experiencing
this long-term fast.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And I started receiving
visions and downloads.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time
since the time when

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I had the spirit come
through and share with me

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:90%
that I needed to breathe.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:90%
And I started seeing colors.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.580 align:middle line:90%
And it was the chakra system--

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.740 align:middle line:84%
red and orange and
yellow and green.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
this is interesting.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.185 align:middle line:84%
I know about these chakras, but
I've never really done anything

00:11:36.185 --> 00:11:36.985 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:11:36.985 --> 00:11:39.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like knowing meditation
but not meditating,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.150 align:middle line:84%
knowing nutrition
but not eating clean.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, I feel like
there is something within this.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:48.910 align:middle line:84%
So I started researching
the ancient Vedic teachings

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.950 align:middle line:84%
through the Bhagavad Gita
and Upanishads and so on.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And I found an
ancient blueprint that

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.910 align:middle line:84%
showed that the
primary interference

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:00.470 align:middle line:84%
pattern, the biggest
problem for the activation

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.330 align:middle line:84%
of dormant energy, for the
healing of the human body,

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.990 align:middle line:84%
for the illumination of
the mind and the brain,

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:84%
the biggest blockages are
lower frequency emotions.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.030 align:middle line:90%
Fear.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.345 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Yeah, 100%.

00:12:13.345 --> 00:12:14.970 align:middle line:10%
So Einstein said
there's fear and love,

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.950 align:middle line:10%
all other emotions are
derivatives of these two.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered there's
deeper layers to this.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So fear blocks the first energy
center-- the root chakra.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.432 align:middle line:90%
Guilt blocks the second one.

00:12:25.432 --> 00:12:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: And then
shame blocks the third one.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Grief blocks the heart.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:31.550 align:middle line:90%
And so on.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, I started studying
this and going deeper

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and it brought me to the
work of Dr. Hawkins, who

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.080 align:middle line:84%
of course, was able to quantify
the vibrational bandwidth.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.040 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.497 align:middle line:84%
And in so many of his
books and his work,

00:12:44.497 --> 00:12:46.080 align:middle line:84%
he's been highlighting
this, including

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.840 align:middle line:84%
the book Letting Go, which
is a wonderful piece of work.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And he showed that fear
vibrates at approximately

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:84%
100 oscillations
or cycles a second.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Guilt is at 30.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.320 align:middle line:90%
Shame is at 20.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.380 align:middle line:90%
So 0 is death.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.360 align:middle line:84%
So feeling not good enough
or ashamed of who you are

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.280 align:middle line:84%
is just a little bit
healthier than being not here.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.228 align:middle line:90%
Grief is at 75 and so on.

00:13:11.228 --> 00:13:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, it's like
shame is self-annihilation

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.780 align:middle line:90%
on some levels.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: For me,
depending on how deep you want

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.240 align:middle line:90%
to go.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.865 align:middle line:84%
But for me, in
theory, I feel shame

00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and not feeling
good enough, it's

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.240 align:middle line:84%
almost like disrespecting
the universe because you're

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.520 align:middle line:84%
a unique being with
so much love and light

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.080 align:middle line:90%
and beauty and potential.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And not feeling
good enough, it's

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.260 align:middle line:84%
making it about you, not
about your gift to the world.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that's a
long standing program on earth

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.660 align:middle line:84%
that's ubiquitous and has been
going on for tens of thousands

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.460 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the rest
of the societal parental

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.940 align:middle line:90%
programming underneath that.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.898 align:middle line:84%
But it's the larger framework
that is the problem.

00:13:48.898 --> 00:13:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: But that's
starting to clear now.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
starting to clear.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's what's
beautiful is your work

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.060 align:middle line:84%
and other people's
work is coming forward

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.360 align:middle line:84%
just as that other big program
in effect is starting to clear,

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.480 align:middle line:90%
which is beautiful.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So anything more you want
to say about that, about

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.320 align:middle line:90%
the lower emotion?

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Can I add something
at this point?

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Yes, please.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.880 align:middle line:84%
So I have a very
strange birth defect

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.480 align:middle line:84%
in that I don't create
cortisol-- almost none.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's very rare.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.240 align:middle line:84%
But when you're about to tank
through some kind of stressor,

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.320 align:middle line:84%
it took me many, many
years to figure out I

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.920 align:middle line:84%
could actually stop
going into shock

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.200 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning of
the downward spiral,

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.440 align:middle line:84%
just through managing
the fear that

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.930 align:middle line:84%
comes up in response to the
feeling that you're dying.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever it would
start, I used to just like,

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:39.550 align:middle line:90%
oh, no, it's happening.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And the fear would rush
through and then boom,

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.810 align:middle line:84%
everything unconscious have
to be rushed to the ER.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I almost never have to
go to the ER anymore.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.530 align:middle line:90%
All I do is say no.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Breathe.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.270 align:middle line:90%
You're fine.

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:54.850 align:middle line:90%
You know what to do.

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And that changes the outcome
and it's a serious outcome.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.270 align:middle line:90%
You can die from it-- from fear.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like a
canary in the coal mine.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:06.993 align:middle line:84%
Not making cortisol
and not going into fear

00:15:06.993 --> 00:15:08.410 align:middle line:84%
is just what you're
talking about.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:84%
This sympathetic
overdrive people are in,

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.225 align:middle line:84%
it's almost the hallmark
statement for survival.

00:15:14.225 --> 00:15:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Well, and that's
the purpose of the sympathetic

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.410 align:middle line:90%
nervous system-- it is survival.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And they say about
10% of the brain

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.570 align:middle line:84%
should be activated within fight
or flight, as in fight or flight

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:25.490 align:middle line:90%
is necessary.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But if it overwhelms
you and you stay in it,

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:29.550 align:middle line:90%
it's no good.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.133 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN:
There's a whole point.

00:15:31.133 --> 00:15:34.225 align:middle line:84%
Sympathetic dominance is
now a massive pandemic.

00:15:34.225 --> 00:15:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Massive problem.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.903 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN:
And it's worldwide.

00:15:36.903 --> 00:15:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's why I
brought this up, by the way.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Yeah.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And most people--
you're spot on.

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't
know that they're

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:90%
stuck in sympathetic dominance.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And beta brainwaves,
often overthinking.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.953 align:middle line:84%
Default mode network
is locked in.

00:15:48.953 --> 00:15:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
they're in survival

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.510 align:middle line:90%
and they don't even know.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And then they put coffee on
top of it and this and that.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And so they're living in this
feedback loop of survival.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Now when you're operating in the
lower energy centers in fear,

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.770 align:middle line:84%
which is survival--
fight or flight,

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.430 align:middle line:84%
you cannot access the
executive center of the brain.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.490 align:middle line:84%
You cannot even access the
beautiful energy of the heart

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.730 align:middle line:84%
because you're in survival,
where approximately 95% of life

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:14.970 align:middle line:84%
force energy is stored or
trapped in the three lower

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:15.810 align:middle line:90%
centers.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.330 align:middle line:84%
My hypothesis is
then, what would

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.250 align:middle line:84%
happen if we could clear
the lower frequency

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.890 align:middle line:84%
emotions of the body, if we
could turn fear to fuel guilt

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.690 align:middle line:84%
to gratitude, shame
to self-worth, grief

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:31.260 align:middle line:84%
to grace, If we could go through
an inner alchemical process

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.280 align:middle line:84%
where we let go of these--
thoughts, patterns,

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.960 align:middle line:84%
indoctrinations, and programs,
some of which aren't even ours.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.200 align:middle line:84%
We took it on epigenetically
from our parents.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're
talking empaths.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a whole other layer to it.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Yeah, right.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're carrying
around stuff that you

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.920 align:middle line:84%
didn't even know who he
belongs to most of the time.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Exactly.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.640 align:middle line:90%
You know what I love?

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Regina, I love the saying
it ran in my family

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.080 align:middle line:84%
until it ran into me, because we
have the power of consciousness

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:51.880 align:middle line:90%
to change.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.680 align:middle line:90%
We have the power.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:90%
We didn't learn about emotions.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.200 align:middle line:84%
My parents never taught
me about emotions.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:90%
It was just get on with it.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.387 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:16:59.387 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: It's an emotion.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Quit your whining.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Exactly.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.300 align:middle line:90%
But emotion is energy in motion.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.459 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the
universe moves in waves.

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:11.540 align:middle line:84%
But if it's not moving, if the
energy can't flow through you

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.780 align:middle line:84%
because you're stuck in
fear or guilt or shame

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.839 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it might be, then it
becomes not an energy in motion,

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.000 align:middle line:90%
but an issue in the tissue.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.355 align:middle line:84%
And that will then express
itself as a disease

00:17:20.355 --> 00:17:22.980 align:middle line:84%
because the body never makes a
mistake and the body never lies.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:23.859 align:middle line:90%
So if you have--

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because blocking the
flow of all the healing energy

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and light that
would be coming in.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Exactly.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.600 align:middle line:84%
It's the lower
frequency density.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.340 align:middle line:84%
All diseases are
lower vibration.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:35.498 align:middle line:84%
But when we clear this, we can
allow a life force to flow.

00:17:35.498 --> 00:17:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And that is a really
beautiful thing.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's then entering the
higher states of consciousness,

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.420 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.545 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you were
mentioning a little bit ago,

00:17:42.545 --> 00:17:46.046 align:middle line:84%
so that society is basically
stuck in this hypersympathetic

00:17:46.046 --> 00:17:51.860 align:middle line:84%
mode, which also keeps
you in beta overdrive.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:56.620 align:middle line:90%
So in a kinder, gentler more--

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:84%
a world that's more responsive
to who we really are, let's

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.180 align:middle line:90%
just put it that way.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Would we mostly be
resting in alpha state?

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: It varies
and it should vary depending

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.440 align:middle line:90%
on the situations.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.578 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can even access
high gamma brainwave frequency.

00:18:09.578 --> 00:18:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Gamma
from relaxed states.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Yeah,
super consciousness.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But I mean, would
we more or less be in and out

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:84%
of that much more open,
sensitive, subtle state of mind?

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.218 align:middle line:84%
So we would be much
more intuitive.

00:18:22.218 --> 00:18:23.635 align:middle line:84%
I'm bringing that
up because we're

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:24.900 align:middle line:90%
going to get to that as well.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.955 align:middle line:84%
You use breathwork to access
intuition and much more.

00:18:27.955 --> 00:18:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Yeah.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And everyone has
this amazing ability.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.330 align:middle line:84%
The scientists say
that we're using--

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.970 align:middle line:84%
say 98% of our DNA is
junk-- they call it.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.430 align:middle line:84%
So we're using
about 2% of our DNA.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.130 align:middle line:84%
We're accessing very small
parts of the brain normally.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.570 align:middle line:90%
And so on.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And now with the
studies that we've seen,

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.990 align:middle line:84%
we know that we can activate
DNA and gene expression

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.750 align:middle line:84%
through the study, I mentioned
the University of Oslo 2013

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot
more to it than that.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:00.150 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we are
supernatural light beings that

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.890 align:middle line:84%
have been downregulated to
a two-stranded carbon DNA,

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and we are in the
process of remembering,

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.070 align:middle line:84%
putting back the parts
and the pieces of the self

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.970 align:middle line:84%
by illuminating the
body and the mind.

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.018 align:middle line:84%
And these are the tools
that are now available.

00:19:13.018 --> 00:19:14.810 align:middle line:84%
They've been around
for thousands of years,

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:17.088 align:middle line:84%
but they were lost and
they are coming back.

00:19:17.088 --> 00:19:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, they are.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:22.050 align:middle line:84%
So give us a couple of
testimonials or case studies

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:24.470 align:middle line:84%
you know of where
people have come in

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:27.360 align:middle line:84%
for cases having
to do essentially

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.720 align:middle line:84%
with lower emotional
function that

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.917 align:middle line:90%
is now manifested in disease?

00:19:31.917 --> 00:19:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: I
had one lovely lady.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Susan.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.720 align:middle line:84%
She came to one of
my last experiences.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.960 align:middle line:84%
She has been blind
her whole life

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.360 align:middle line:84%
and she has not seen
colors for 27 years.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.305 align:middle line:90%
She does the work.

00:19:45.305 --> 00:19:46.680 align:middle line:84%
She clears the
fear and the guilt

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and the shame and
the grief and so on.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And then afterwards,
with her carer

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.080 align:middle line:84%
there, obviously doing
sign language, which means

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.780 align:middle line:90%
she was holding her hands.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And as she was
moving her hands, she

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:84%
was realizing what
she was expressing.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And she was sharing
with us how she

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.020 align:middle line:84%
had seen colors for the first
time in her life in 27 years.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is
with her internal sight.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.440 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't seeing it even
with her internal sight

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.340 align:middle line:90%
prior to that.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Nothing.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Not a single experience 27
years and within 30 minutes

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.380 align:middle line:84%
max of breathing, she's
tapping into the quantum field.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.880 align:middle line:84%
She's activating the
pineal pituitary circuit,

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.825 align:middle line:84%
and she's seeing colors for
the first time in 27 years.

00:20:22.825 --> 00:20:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: And
then we have healings--

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.100 align:middle line:90%
spontaneous remissions.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is the thing,
time is only linear

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.520 align:middle line:84%
if you're operating in
the third dimension,

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.840 align:middle line:84%
because time is a key aspect
of the fourth dimension.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.920 align:middle line:84%
But when you're truly
present and you're

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.515 align:middle line:84%
bringing the awareness
up to the brain,

00:20:39.515 --> 00:20:41.140 align:middle line:84%
you can truly access
the quantum field.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.520 align:middle line:90%
There is no time and space.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.860 align:middle line:84%
So healing happens
instantaneously.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.100 align:middle line:84%
There is no needing to
wait another 10 years.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.500 align:middle line:84%
If and when you can feel the
body and being with light,

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.860 align:middle line:84%
darkness disappears, a.k.a.
healing happens instantaneously.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not a promise,
but it's a potential,

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.200 align:middle line:90%
just like the quantum field.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk
about using the breath then,

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.040 align:middle line:84%
because virtually everyone
watching this is interested

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.280 align:middle line:84%
in being their most
intuitive they can.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And accessing higher mind
in the hermetic parlance,

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.280 align:middle line:90%
it's higher mind, right?

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.155 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Yeah.

00:21:11.155 --> 00:21:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so let's talk
about accessing higher mind with

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.060 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.442 align:middle line:84%
And we can draw in the
practices of the yogis in that.

00:21:19.442 --> 00:21:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN:
There's two things.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle line:84%
The most useful tool,
which is so simple to do

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.585 align:middle line:90%
and a free of charge.

00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:28.210 align:middle line:84%
I think it actually
costs us a lot more

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.770 align:middle line:84%
if we don't do it, is to
realize that most people are

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.410 align:middle line:84%
stuck in sympathetic
dominance in fight or flight.

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.250 align:middle line:10%
The fastest, easiest
way to override

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.670 align:middle line:10%
that circuit, that
firing and wiring,

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.970 align:middle line:10%
the pattern that's been going
on for sometimes decades,

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.050 align:middle line:10%
is to learn to breathe
through the nose.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
tell us about that.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.810 align:middle line:84%
That alternate
breathing or which--

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:50.370 align:middle line:84%
show us the best kind
to rapidly get out

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:51.550 align:middle line:90%
of sympathetic overdrive.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.425 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Easy.

00:21:52.425 --> 00:21:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So alternate nostril
breathing is very powerful

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:55.790 align:middle line:90%
and very powerful.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:59.222 align:middle line:84%
But the simplest way is simply
just to be a nose breather.

00:21:59.222 --> 00:22:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So most people, when you're
in sympathetic dominance,

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:02.722 align:middle line:90%
will breathe through the mouth.

00:22:02.722 --> 00:22:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And then we stimulate the
sympathetic nervous system,

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:07.170 align:middle line:90%
adding in more fight or flight.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.662 align:middle line:84%
But if we simply learn to
breathe through the nose,

00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:10.870 align:middle line:90%
that means we're at the desk.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.590 align:middle line:84%
We're doing our work,
we're driving our car,

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:13.730 align:middle line:84%
we're picking up
our kids, whatever

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:15.750 align:middle line:84%
it is, we're just breathe
in through the nose

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.270 align:middle line:84%
into the lower part of the
belly, to the lower dantian.

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And we allow the
belly to come out,

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:23.570 align:middle line:84%
and then we breathe
out of the nose

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:26.330 align:middle line:90%
again and relaxing the body.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Already we are starting to fire
and wire the parasympathetic.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:34.130 align:middle line:84%
So most people just need
to become nose breathers.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I even taped my mouth
when I sleep at night

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:38.780 align:middle line:84%
so that I can continuously
fire wire that loop.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's a thing now.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:40.863 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Yep.

00:22:40.863 --> 00:22:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So, honestly, if you can
catch yourself as many times

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:47.663 align:middle line:84%
in the day being aware that
you are aware of the fact

00:22:47.663 --> 00:22:49.330 align:middle line:84%
that you're breathing
through your nose,

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.050 align:middle line:84%
you're already going to
downregulate the stress

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:51.870 align:middle line:90%
response.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.690 align:middle line:84%
That is a practice
that is free, that

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:58.267 align:middle line:84%
is vital, and necessary
for the rest of your life.

00:22:58.267 --> 00:22:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.433 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: That's it.

00:23:00.433 --> 00:23:01.530 align:middle line:90%
If we can start there--

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.322 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's bringing
up something else.

00:23:03.322 --> 00:23:05.590 align:middle line:90%
You have cilia in your nose.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.090 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to help remove
some of the toxins on the way

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:08.890 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:09.990 align:middle line:84%
When you're breathing
through your mouth,

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:11.750 align:middle line:84%
you don't have any
of those filters.

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.292 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Even
when I exercise.

00:23:13.292 --> 00:23:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you're breathing
in unfiltered air through

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:19.800 align:middle line:84%
the mouth and all the
pollutants and everything else.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: And
this is the thing.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.820 align:middle line:10%
If you have to run
away from a tiger

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.100 align:middle line:10%
or from a dangerous
situation, you're

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.200 align:middle line:10%
not going to breathe
through your nose.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.200 align:middle line:10%
You need to get a lot of
oxygen really quickly.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.120 align:middle line:10%
And we do that in
transformational breathing--

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.060 align:middle line:10%
mouth breathing.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.580 align:middle line:84%
But let's say 90 plus
percent of the time,

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.200 align:middle line:90%
you should be a nose breather.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.480 align:middle line:90%
So that's step number 1.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Can you just show the
alternate breathing for those

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.000 align:middle line:84%
who want to go for
the super punch?

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:38.620 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Yeah.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.453 align:middle line:84%
Alternate nostril
breathing-- Nadi Shodhana,

00:23:40.453 --> 00:23:41.660 align:middle line:90%
is such a powerful practice.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.247 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: So basically,
you close one nostril,

00:23:44.247 --> 00:23:46.800 align:middle line:84%
you breathe in,
and then you hold,

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.387 align:middle line:84%
and then you alternate by
opening and breathing out.

00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:52.720 align:middle line:84%
so let's say that I breathe
in through my right nostril.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just do it
for a couple breaths.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: So if
you want to join in.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Hold, you swap, and then
you exhale through the left.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:05.580 align:middle line:84%
You hold on the exhale,
you inhale again

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:12.260 align:middle line:84%
through the left, hold, swap,
exhale through the right.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And you'll do it
a little bit more

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.040 align:middle line:84%
slowly than what I
just demonstrated.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.840 align:middle line:84%
But this actually has been
shown on functional MRI scans

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.340 align:middle line:84%
to create coherence
between the left

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:21.600 align:middle line:84%
and the right
hemispheres of the brain.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I love about it.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: It's amazing.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.575 align:middle line:84%
And most people,
as you know, are

00:24:24.575 --> 00:24:26.620 align:middle line:84%
stuck in left brain,
right side, which

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.880 align:middle line:84%
is the more masculine
dominant side of things,

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.760 align:middle line:84%
continuously being busy, and/or
at least in fight or flight.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.763 align:middle line:84%
But this can
actually help access

00:24:34.763 --> 00:24:36.180 align:middle line:84%
the right part of
the brain, which

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.880 align:middle line:84%
is the more emotional
side of the brain.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.055 align:middle line:90%
No, that's beautiful.

00:24:39.055 --> 00:24:40.650 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for sharing that with us.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:41.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So higher consciousness,
higher mind.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
intuition and what's

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.140 align:middle line:84%
happened with other
people when they've

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.580 align:middle line:84%
started doing the breathwork
where everything just sort

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.422 align:middle line:90%
of opens up for them.

00:24:52.422 --> 00:24:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: First, I think
we have to ask the question,

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.680 align:middle line:90%
who am I?

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a very basic,
fundamental question,

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.220 align:middle line:90%
but it's the question, who am I?

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to say I
am spirit or a soul having

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.060 align:middle line:84%
a human experience, you
would be most aligned

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.020 align:middle line:84%
with what quantum physics
is actually saying.

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.540 align:middle line:84%
So Max Planck discovered
this over 100 years ago.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.260 align:middle line:90%
We know it to be true today.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:14.200 align:middle line:84%
So when we realized that we are
not just the body or the mind,

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.110 align:middle line:84%
but the eternal
consciousness that

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:19.030 align:middle line:84%
occupies, as it has an
experience through the body

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and the mind, we realize that
we are the eternal embodied

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:23.590 align:middle line:90%
in temporary time.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.030 align:middle line:84%
If we can identify
that there's more to us

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.150 align:middle line:84%
than just flesh and
bone, we can then

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:31.430 align:middle line:84%
begin the practice of,
as I say, coming home.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.670 align:middle line:90%
So breath is the way to do this.

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:39.310 align:middle line:84%
I believe the soul stands for
the state of unconditional love.

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I think that's good.

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: The higher
self, the aspect of us that just

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:90%
loves.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.375 align:middle line:84%
And so most people are
operating in survival--

00:25:46.375 --> 00:25:47.250 align:middle line:90%
we talked about that.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.790 align:middle line:84%
We're operating within
the five senses or six

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:51.010 align:middle line:90%
if you include thought.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:52.990 align:middle line:84%
But we know there's so
much more to the brain

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.110 align:middle line:84%
and to this experience
that we call life.

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So breath, particularly this
type of breath that I share,

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:00.550 align:middle line:84%
there's many types of breath,
but quantum breath specifically

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.110 align:middle line:84%
is moving the energy from
the lower energy centers--

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.290 align:middle line:84%
number 1, 2, and 3, where most
of the energy or the life force,

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:09.230 align:middle line:84%
the prana, the Chi, is
stored, and moving its way

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:11.070 align:middle line:90%
up through the heart.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:13.480 align:middle line:84%
When we enter the heart,
we can access and open

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.820 align:middle line:90%
the torus field--

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.960 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic
field of the heart.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.440 align:middle line:84%
When we get to
the throat, we can

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.760 align:middle line:84%
begin to get messages of
clarity and wisdom and truth.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.900 align:middle line:84%
When we get up to
the pineal gland,

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.447 align:middle line:84%
we can activate this amazing
pineal pituitary circuit.

00:26:28.447 --> 00:26:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
ancient ones obviously

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:84%
refer to this as the all
seeing eye or the third eye.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.600 align:middle line:84%
But there's more to it
than just the pineal.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.040 align:middle line:84%
The pineal, I believe,
is the masculine

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and the pituitary
is the feminine.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.520 align:middle line:84%
If you consider now your brain
and central nervous system

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.320 align:middle line:90%
bathes in cerebrospinal fluid.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So the CSF is what protects
the central nervous system

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.240 align:middle line:90%
at all times.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.280 align:middle line:84%
It's made up primarily
of proteins and salts.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And this energy that is at
the base of the spine moves--

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.120 align:middle line:84%
you flush your brain
twice a day, basically,

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.880 align:middle line:84%
moves through the
cerebrospinal fluid.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, if and when you
can create pressure

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:84%
at the base of the spine--
you can do this via breathwork

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and what we refer
to as the root lock

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.640 align:middle line:84%
by contracting the
perineum, squeezing

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.160 align:middle line:84%
the glutes at the base, you
will create pressure in the CSF,

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.940 align:middle line:84%
primarily the third ventricle
in the brain, which also,

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.800 align:middle line:84%
of course, is where
you find the pineal.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.880 align:middle line:84%
The interesting
thing that we see

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.240 align:middle line:84%
is the pineal gland--
we see this on MRI

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.420 align:middle line:84%
scans, has these
tiny little crystals.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.760 align:middle line:90%
They're called calcite.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.160 align:middle line:90%
Now they are a piezoelectric.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Piezo, meaning pressure,
electric being electric.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you create in
and out, in and out

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.980 align:middle line:84%
breath with pressure at
the base of the spine,

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.840 align:middle line:84%
like the ancient yogis were
teaching for thousands of years,

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.180 align:middle line:84%
you create pressure
against the brain,

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:49.200 align:middle line:84%
against the pineal, which then
activates the electric signals

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.240 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.340 align:middle line:84%
So with pressure and driving
the energy up to the brain,

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.000 align:middle line:84%
you will literally see
the pineal gland begins

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.220 align:middle line:90%
to oscillate and vibrate.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Now this turns it
into a transducer,

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.483 align:middle line:84%
which is, of course, why
we call it the third eye.

00:28:02.483 --> 00:28:04.900 align:middle line:84%
But the missing piece, which
I find is really interesting.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's talking
about the pineal gland.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.200 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.810 align:middle line:84%
But in nature, there's the
masculine and the feminine,

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:14.690 align:middle line:84%
the yin and the yang, the
electric and the magnetic.

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.170 align:middle line:90%
We are an electromagnetic being.

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Just like the earth has a
north pole and the south pole,

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:90%
we have the same.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens when you bring
the energy up to the pineal,

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.730 align:middle line:84%
the calcite crystals
get pressure on them.

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.930 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland
begins to vibrate.

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:31.530 align:middle line:90%
Then the pineal gland activates.

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:33.610 align:middle line:84%
What it does also right
in front of the pineal

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:36.690 align:middle line:84%
is the pituitary, right at the
back of the base of the nose.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And the pituitary
is the feminine.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's what the ancient yogis
called the Ida and Pingala.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So as powerful as it is to
talk about the pineal, that's

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.050 align:middle line:90%
the masculine.

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.530 align:middle line:84%
But you will not have
creation or activation

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:50.750 align:middle line:90%
without the feminine as well.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
the secret lies.

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So when you activate the
pineal, it begins to shimmer.

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:55.590 align:middle line:90%
It begins to vibrate.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:59.290 align:middle line:84%
It can create melatonin,
serotonin, dimethyltryptamine,

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:00.618 align:middle line:90%
DMT, which is-

00:29:00.618 --> 00:29:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: DMT, yeah, it's
going to take you on a trip.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: That's a wonder.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:04.530 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.810 align:middle line:84%
DMT exists in
everything organic--

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:09.730 align:middle line:90%
plants, animals, humans.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's an illegal substance if
you were to sell it or smoke it.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.250 align:middle line:84%
But you don't need
to have an exogenous.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:17.310 align:middle line:84%
You can have an
endogenous experience.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Your brain will make
DMT if you can move

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:20.810 align:middle line:90%
enough energy to the brain.

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:22.850 align:middle line:90%
So back to the Ida/Pingala.

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:26.710 align:middle line:84%
When you activate the pineal
and it begins to shimmer,

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:29.970 align:middle line:84%
it becomes transducer or almost
like a conductor of energy.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:32.822 align:middle line:84%
You can then tune in to the
energy that exists in the field

00:29:32.822 --> 00:29:34.530 align:middle line:84%
that you might not
have been able to tune

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:38.290 align:middle line:84%
into with your five senses,
but it's still here.

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the pituitary
kicks in, which

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.030 align:middle line:90%
is the more intuitive feminine.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.090 align:middle line:84%
The two combined is
the eye of Horus.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:49.290 align:middle line:84%
The two combined
activates the third eye.

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So the pineal, yes,
it's the gateway,

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:54.330 align:middle line:84%
but the pituitary and
the feminine access

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.770 align:middle line:84%
is what creates the
pineal pituitary.

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the illumination

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.313 align:middle line:84%
of the mind, which also
gives access to the crown.

00:30:01.313 --> 00:30:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
that's what you do.

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:04.438 align:middle line:84%
When you're doing your
weekend workshops,

00:30:04.438 --> 00:30:06.450 align:middle line:84%
you always work toward
that toward the end.

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: That's correct.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.600 align:middle line:84%
So we want to clear all
these low frequency emotions.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It takes a little
time to get through that.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk about
that for a minute.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.640 align:middle line:84%
So when people start
doing breathwork,

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.000 align:middle line:84%
there are people who say,
I'm not doing that again.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.340 align:middle line:90%
I've done it before.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.820 align:middle line:90%
There was too much trauma.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the initial release

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.700 align:middle line:84%
before we can rise up
into that final expression

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.480 align:middle line:90%
that people experience.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.680 align:middle line:84%
You said it yourself, you
saw your little brother.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Yeah.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I truly do believe
that the emotions are

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.020 align:middle line:90%
stored in the body.

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:37.820 align:middle line:84%
The thoughts are the
language of the mind

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and the emotions of the
language of the body.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And when we store these issues
in the tissues, they're there.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.860 align:middle line:84%
But because we get so busy,
the default mode network

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.360 align:middle line:90%
is in hyperdrive.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And it basically keeps us
in the ego mind and fight

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.500 align:middle line:90%
or flight and survival.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't take the
time or have the time

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.540 align:middle line:84%
or get the time to really
sit and feel and process

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:58.692 align:middle line:90%
these emotions.

00:30:58.692 --> 00:31:00.900 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when we do
the breath is you actually

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.760 align:middle line:84%
downregulate the default
mode network in the brain

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and you actually bring
to light what is actually

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:10.313 align:middle line:84%
inside of you, which is why
it's not creating traumas.

00:31:10.313 --> 00:31:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Breathwork doesn't
create traumas.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, It's
just releasing.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.118 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: It's
releasing, it's revealing,

00:31:15.118 --> 00:31:17.780 align:middle line:84%
it's bringing to your awareness
that which was suppressed that

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.260 align:middle line:90%
can now be expressed.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.900 align:middle line:84%
So when you do this
kind of breath,

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.900 align:middle line:84%
it'll come out, like for
example, for me, seeing

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.820 align:middle line:90%
the visions of a blue baby.

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
traumatic, but I realized

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.380 align:middle line:84%
that as I was breathing,
I was releasing.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And as I said,
rather out than in.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.980 align:middle line:84%
So I could let go of
it and sit with it

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:39.500 align:middle line:84%
and feel it and be OK
with the integration of it

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.260 align:middle line:90%
rather than suppressing it.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So firstly, it downregulates
the default mode network.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.020 align:middle line:84%
It gives you access to
those parts of the body

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.300 align:middle line:84%
and the mind that
has been suppressed.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And it actually gives you
a beautiful whole range

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.080 align:middle line:84%
of neurochemicals
in the brain as well

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.340 align:middle line:84%
using breath, which allows
us to sit with what has been

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.600 align:middle line:90%
suppressed and to integrate it.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.590 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important
if we are spirits having

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:07.110 align:middle line:84%
a human experience, life
never happened to us,

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:09.390 align:middle line:90%
life always happened for us.

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And since you cannot
change the past,

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:13.450 align:middle line:90%
you can change the meaning.

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:15.450 align:middle line:84%
If you change the meaning,
you change your life.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:16.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's the key.

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So once you see it
from that perspective,

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:20.910 align:middle line:84%
anything and everything
can be healed.

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is very personal
question of you and esoteric.

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever connect later on
with the soul of the one who

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:30.590 align:middle line:90%
was your little brother?

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Yeah,
he's with me all the time.

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, I'm getting
teary because that's what I was

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:35.190 align:middle line:90%
feeling.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Yeah,
he's with me all the time.

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:38.108 align:middle line:84%
And my mother as
well, she's passed

00:32:38.108 --> 00:32:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and she comes
through all the time.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Why did your
brother choose to leave early?

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:46.030 align:middle line:90%


00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: I think
for me, in my reality,

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:53.310 align:middle line:84%
it was to show me and to
allow me to help others to see

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:55.310 align:middle line:90%
the preciousness of life.

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:59.250 align:middle line:84%
We rush through, we don't stop,
we don't feel, we don't breathe,

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:00.660 align:middle line:90%
we're not really present.

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.368 align:middle line:84%
We're not really
connected-- most people.

00:33:02.368 --> 00:33:04.702 align:middle line:84%
And then we get to the end
of our lives and we look back

00:33:04.702 --> 00:33:05.520 align:middle line:90%
and we go, wow.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I never
really connected.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Where was
I in the human experience?

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:11.580 align:middle line:90%
Where was I?

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Here was this
precious soul that has reminded

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.460 align:middle line:84%
you of that throughout your life
and is with you and your mom.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Yes.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:20.820 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, everything
is for purpose.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Some of us only live a short
time in any given incarnation.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Some of us live
longer than we should.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Yeah.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
other story too--

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.220 align:middle line:84%
how long we can live when we
learn intermittent fasting,

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.740 align:middle line:90%
breathwork, meditation.

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.077 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and that's
coming up for us as a species.

00:33:39.077 --> 00:33:41.400 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be living
another 20 or 30 years longer

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.460 align:middle line:90%
in the very near future.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.480 align:middle line:84%
It's starting for
some people already.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So one other thing I
want to get to-- we

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.700 align:middle line:84%
have a few things
we're going to get to.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:48.920 align:middle line:90%
We still have a little time.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.780 align:middle line:84%
The Kundalini, because I have
such a strange relationship

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:52.580 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:55.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sure most
people don't have that kind,

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.580 align:middle line:90%
but still others may as well.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.360 align:middle line:84%
This is very intense
because many people

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.960 align:middle line:90%
go to Kundalini yoga.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what's happening

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:07.220 align:middle line:84%
when you go to your Kundalini
yoga class for a normal person--

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.719 align:middle line:90%
more normal.

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:10.268 align:middle line:90%
No one's normal.

00:34:10.268 --> 00:34:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: What is normal?

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, Kundalini,
in its essence,

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.320 align:middle line:84%
should be tremendously
respected.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.920 align:middle line:84%
It is a dormant force at
the base of the spine that

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.120 align:middle line:84%
can be awakened through
these teachings,

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:27.420 align:middle line:84%
but it should be
treated as such.

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.139 align:middle line:84%
Many breathwork
facilitators out there,

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:31.860 align:middle line:84%
they have no idea the amount
of power that they're playing.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:34.027 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, you should
go into Kundalini class,

00:34:34.027 --> 00:34:37.159 align:middle line:84%
anybody can come on and
just wander in any condition

00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:39.380 align:middle line:84%
physically, mentally,
emotionally, any age,

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.080 align:middle line:90%
and they start you.

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.199 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: It's because
they don't really know the power

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:46.040 align:middle line:84%
of the tools that
they're sharing.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.500 align:middle line:84%
So for me, this
should be respected--

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.739 align:middle line:90%
tremendously respected.

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And so Kundalini
awakening can also

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.730 align:middle line:84%
be likened to psychiatric
conditions or experiences.

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So you should not
take that lightly.

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So if and when you
go to breathwork,

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:01.970 align:middle line:84%
you need to make sure
that the practitioners are

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:03.850 align:middle line:84%
trauma-informed,
that they really

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:06.210 align:middle line:84%
know what they're doing,
that they really understand

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:08.250 align:middle line:84%
the body, the mind,
the emotions, and also

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:12.590 align:middle line:84%
spirit, because this is how
we bring spirit into the body.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.170 align:middle line:84%
How we bring light
into the body is

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:16.090 align:middle line:84%
using the breath,
which I'd love to talk

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:19.630 align:middle line:84%
about how we can breathe in
alignment with the torus field.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And as we then exhale, we feel
the body and being with light.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:26.650 align:middle line:84%
But the Kundalini energy in
general should be respected.

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:27.830 align:middle line:90%
You should study it.

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:30.270 align:middle line:84%
You should know what
you're doing before it.

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you are to
engage in it, make

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:34.770 align:middle line:84%
sure that the practitioners or
the people holding this space

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:37.410 align:middle line:84%
are well-equipped to
hold the space for you.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:38.650 align:middle line:90%
And that you are ready.

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, well, my little
cautionary tale is my guides

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:45.330 align:middle line:84%
told me many, many years ago,
do not participate in Kundalini

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:47.630 align:middle line:84%
yoga because I'm not that
attached to the body.

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know I had
landed in a Kundalini class.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.795 align:middle line:84%
At the end of class, there
was me sitting next to myself.

00:35:54.795 --> 00:35:56.170 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't
clear the classroom

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:58.430 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't
get back in my body,

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:01.110 align:middle line:84%
so I couldn't get my shoes on
or write a check or anything.

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:03.490 align:middle line:84%
It took a while to
integrate the two so I could

00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:05.350 align:middle line:90%
do anything and move my body.

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:06.855 align:middle line:90%
So that happens too.

00:36:06.855 --> 00:36:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: It's actually
more common than you think.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And so when I do the
breath like this breath,

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't even say
it's not even mine.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.130 align:middle line:84%
It came through me through
spirit, my higher self

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:18.890 align:middle line:90%
from past lives, I'm not sure.

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:22.130 align:middle line:84%
But the technology, as I said,
the fifth dimensional technology

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:26.510 align:middle line:84%
that arrived when I almost lost
my life, I am a custodian of it,

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:28.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm a transmission of
it, but it's not mine--

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:30.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't take credit for it.

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:32.650 align:middle line:84%
That in itself comes
with a whole bunch

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:35.610 align:middle line:84%
of very specific protocols
that we practice,

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.650 align:middle line:84%
such as when we open
the portal, we only

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:38.823 align:middle line:90%
work with the highest light.

00:36:38.823 --> 00:36:40.490 align:middle line:84%
We banish all energies
and entities that

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:42.010 align:middle line:90%
are not of the highest light.

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:45.630 align:middle line:84%
We pull people from the lower
centers into the higher centers.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:47.310 align:middle line:84%
We activate and
illuminate the brain.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:48.893 align:middle line:84%
We feel the body and
being with light.

00:36:48.893 --> 00:36:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And then we pull every part,
piece, fragment, and aspect

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:55.340 align:middle line:84%
of that person, including
their own souls light

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:58.040 align:middle line:90%
back into the body fully again.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
agreement that we have--

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it
makes total sense.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.562 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN:
Before we even begin.

00:37:02.562 --> 00:37:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And then we can seal the
entire force field in light.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.440 align:middle line:84%
But the grounding-- if
that's not done properly,

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.380 align:middle line:84%
if you just go into
Kundalini or breathwork

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:12.640 align:middle line:84%
and you just have the
experience, it's very common.

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.540 align:middle line:84%
We have people living-- like
one of my staff members now,

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:18.540 align:middle line:84%
she lost her daughter
when she was young

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and she grieved and
grieved, but never got

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.050 align:middle line:84%
to connect with
the daughter again.

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:25.300 align:middle line:84%
She did the quantum breathwork
the first time, the one

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.380 align:middle line:90%
we call quantum DMT breathwork.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And she had an out-of-body
mystical experience.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.320 align:middle line:84%
She activated the pineal
pituitary circuit,

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.820 align:middle line:84%
opened the crown, connected
to the quantum field,

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.520 align:middle line:90%
and was with her daughter again.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it's wonderful.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.698 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN:
For the first time.

00:37:39.698 --> 00:37:42.180 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't
want to come back.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
living in that way,

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I understand you don't want to
come back, where the way I did,

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.400 align:middle line:90%
it was just very pedestrian.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I was just sitting beside
myself on the floor.

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.690 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't mystical or spiritual.

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:55.010 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't-- just wasn't
able to integrate the two.

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: It was
sitting beside yourself.

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:57.490 align:middle line:84%
You're having an
out-of-body experience.

00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:58.948 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
I was out-of-body.

00:37:58.948 --> 00:38:01.890 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't the fun kind where
you go wee, I like those better.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: I
call those soulgasms.

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:04.483 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I like those.

00:38:04.483 --> 00:38:05.283 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:06.310 align:middle line:90%
So two more things.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:08.370 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
accessing past lives.

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And then what you
were talking about--

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:11.770 align:middle line:90%
the torus style breathing.

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Past lives
are very interesting.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
research out there now

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:19.190 align:middle line:84%
showing that the soul will go
through a lot of experiences.

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And that you often, as
it says in the Kabbalah,

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:25.070 align:middle line:84%
that you'll come into this
life with certain lessons

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:27.630 align:middle line:90%
to learn or wounding to heal.

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:28.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:31.210 align:middle line:84%
What I do know is that we all
have something to work with,

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:33.390 align:middle line:84%
and we all have
something that we

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:36.750 align:middle line:84%
know epigenetically has been
passed down, that's for sure.

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:38.992 align:middle line:84%
And I also truly do
believe that the soul goes

00:38:38.992 --> 00:38:40.450 align:middle line:84%
through these
experiences to learn,

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:43.225 align:middle line:84%
to grow, to heal, to evolve, and
ascend, to come home, to love.

00:38:43.225 --> 00:38:44.850 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say when
we do the breath,

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:45.892 align:middle line:90%
we're not going anywhere.

00:38:45.892 --> 00:38:47.190 align:middle line:90%
We're coming home.

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:49.870 align:middle line:84%
So as we're in this
human experience,

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:53.150 align:middle line:84%
I believe now is the time
for humanity to awaken,

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:54.470 align:middle line:90%
to come home to love.

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:58.350 align:middle line:84%
There's been 26,000 year or so
cycle and we were the furthest

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:00.903 align:middle line:84%
away from the sun
in December 2012.

00:39:00.903 --> 00:39:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And now we're spiraling
back into light.

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:04.950 align:middle line:84%
There's so much light
entering the atmosphere,

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:08.330 align:middle line:84%
toggling on dormant DNA,
removing interference patterns.

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And I truly do believe
that this is our time.

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Based on the soul's journey
through the past lives

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:16.970 align:middle line:84%
and whatever it's experienced,
I believe this life,

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:19.830 align:middle line:84%
and I can't say for
sure, is an accumulation

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:21.670 align:middle line:90%
of all of those lessons.

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And the outcome is to heal,
is to remember to come home,

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:29.910 align:middle line:84%
and to activate that dormant
potential from contraction

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:32.150 align:middle line:90%
to expansion, from fear to love.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:33.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's the purpose.

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's when if you
include-- in my model,

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I have eight chakras
that we work with,

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:42.310 align:middle line:84%
not just the seven because I
also access the soul star energy

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:44.210 align:middle line:84%
center, which is
pure white light.

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that's
one way we can bring

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:48.740 align:middle line:90%
the soul's light into the body.

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And I don't believe heaven
on earth is out there.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.760 align:middle line:84%
I believe heaven on earth is our
opportunity to bring it here.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.457 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the-- if you can

00:39:56.457 --> 00:39:58.040 align:middle line:84%
share that, we have
just a few minutes

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.600 align:middle line:84%
left, the torus style of
breathing that you were speaking

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.520 align:middle line:90%
of earlier.

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: It's interesting
because when I ask my students,

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.260 align:middle line:84%
how many of you know
what a Taurus field is,

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:08.080 align:middle line:84%
not many people will
raise their hand.

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.440 align:middle line:90%
So the torus field--

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:13.120 align:middle line:84%
T-O-R-U-S is the electromagnetic
field that we are.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.720 align:middle line:84%
It's proven, we've always
been, will always be.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:19.260 align:middle line:84%
The average person's torus field
is about three to six feet wide.

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's extending
beyond the body.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a donut shaped
electromagnetic field.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Again, the Earth is
a giant torus field.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Every cell in your body
is and has a torus field.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.360 align:middle line:84%
But when the torus
field is closed

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.340 align:middle line:84%
and the center is, of course,
the heart, when it's closed,

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.080 align:middle line:84%
it's when we live in
fear and survival.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.140 align:middle line:84%
When the torus field
in the heart can open,

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:41.080 align:middle line:84%
we can expand our
electromagnetic field.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.200 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing is,
at the base of the spine

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.180 align:middle line:84%
and in the brain, there
is the polarities.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you breathe in through
the bottom, out through the top,

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.480 align:middle line:84%
and you can create this pressure
against the pineal pituitary

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:57.200 align:middle line:84%
circuit, you will then create an
induction field, an actual field

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.400 align:middle line:84%
of positive at the top,
negative at the bottom, which

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.640 align:middle line:90%
is a torus field.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.640 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually
increase and expand

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.800 align:middle line:84%
this electromagnetic
field if and when

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.018 align:middle line:90%
we learn to breathe properly.

00:41:09.018 --> 00:41:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the advantage of
expanding that field is what?

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: Love,
peace, healing, ascension.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.220 align:middle line:90%
You become a magnet--

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:19.340 align:middle line:84%
a giant magnet to attract the
things that you want, basically.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And we see again,
when the field is

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.060 align:middle line:84%
contracted is when we
live in fear and survival.

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.380 align:middle line:84%
When we have a
bigger heart field,

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.200 align:middle line:84%
we can actually live in that
beautiful parasympathetic God

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.680 align:middle line:84%
flow state, which is
what we call coming home.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Beautiful.

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:33.580 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts.

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.380 align:middle line:90%
We're out of time.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.180 align:middle line:90%
That just flew.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.888 align:middle line:84%
There's so much more
we could talk about,

00:41:37.888 --> 00:41:39.720 align:middle line:90%
but we have to wrap it up.

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLD-JENSEN: I'll
finish with a quick story.

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Creator, God, universe, spirit,
whatever you want to call it,

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:48.678 align:middle line:84%
is having a
conversation with man

00:41:48.678 --> 00:41:50.970 align:middle line:84%
about the power, the wisdom,
and the unconditional love

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:52.930 align:middle line:90%
of the entire multiverse.

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And creator asks,
man, what should we

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:57.650 align:middle line:84%
do with the power, the wisdom,
and the unconditional love

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:59.270 align:middle line:90%
of the entire multiverse?

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:01.290 align:middle line:90%
And man says we should hide it.

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:03.830 align:middle line:84%
We should hide it at the
top of the tallest mountain,

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:06.470 align:middle line:84%
for surely there they
will never find it.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And creator looks
at man and says,

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:11.090 align:middle line:84%
well, one day when mankind
has evolved enough, they

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:14.690 align:middle line:84%
will go there, and when
they do, they will find it.

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:17.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, says man, then
we shall hide it

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:19.290 align:middle line:84%
at the depths of
the deepest sea,

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:22.330 align:middle line:84%
for surely there they
will never find it.

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Again, creator leans
in, smiles, and says,

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:28.050 align:middle line:84%
well, one day when mankind
has evolved enough, they

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:31.850 align:middle line:84%
will go there, and when
they do, they will find it.

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:34.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, says man,
well, I don't know.

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:37.490 align:middle line:10%
And then creator leans in and
opens up, smiles and says,

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:40.070 align:middle line:10%
why don't we take the
power, the wisdom,

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:43.290 align:middle line:10%
and the unconditional love
of the entire multiverse

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:46.930 align:middle line:10%
and hide it right there in
the middle of themselves.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:50.090 align:middle line:10%
For you see, one day when
mankind has evolved enough,

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:51.230 align:middle line:10%
they will go there.

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And when they do,
they will find it.

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:56.130 align:middle line:84%
That power, that wisdom,
that unconditional love
