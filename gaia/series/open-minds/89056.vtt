00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.310 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
For those who are

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.640 align:middle line:10%
aware of the phenomena of
abduction and alien contact,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.750 align:middle line:10%
our first thought
is that it's random.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Why are certain people
affected and others aren't?

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.560 align:middle line:84%
According to astrologer
Heather Arielle,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.320 align:middle line:90%
it may be in their stars.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Heather's been able to
determine, through her work

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:84%
as an astrologer,
who is predestined

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.490 align:middle line:90%
to have cosmic contact.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.250 align:middle line:84%
She's here with us today to
speak about these factors

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:84%
and show us the charts
of a few people who

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.990 align:middle line:90%
have had such contact.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.490 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.670 align:middle line:84%
This is a totally different
take on astrology,

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and you cast charts
on everything.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.870 align:middle line:90%
So let's start right now.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.420 align:middle line:84%
I know you have
it in your memory.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.040 align:middle line:84%
You charted-- you
created the chart

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.950 align:middle line:84%
for this interview at this
time here in Boulder, Colorado.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HEATHER ARIELLE: Yes, I did.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is the nature
of our chart for this moment?

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: That's
a great question.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't know
everything-- anything

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:84%
that has a beginning
has a chart.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So I was very excited
when I found out the time.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:84%
I put a chart together and
it is a Scorpio Ascendant

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.380 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of the planets,
the sun, most of the planets,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.720 align:middle line:90%
in Leo in the Ninth House.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And why that's important, let's
start with Scorpio Ascendant.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Scorpio rules transformation,
and we are here

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.620 align:middle line:90%
to talk about transformation.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.610 align:middle line:84%
This is the
transformation network.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:84%
It's just the ideal
chart for an interview

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that where we're going
to talk about this theme.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How perfect.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Exactly.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And, in addition, Saturn sits
right on top of the Ascendant.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And whenever Saturn
comes into play,

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Saturn says this
is important, this

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:84%
will have longevity, this
will have permanence.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Because all of the
Leo in the Ninth

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.924 align:middle line:84%
House-- and that is the House
of Publicity-- which is perfect.

00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:05.048 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, there you go.

00:02:05.048 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Exactly.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.390 align:middle line:90%
So it's really ideal.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.590 align:middle line:10%
But Leo can be so
much fun, we don't

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.810 align:middle line:10%
want it to be
purely entertaining.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.470 align:middle line:10%
So it's nice that
we've got the fun Leo,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:10%
and so it's going to
be really enjoyable,

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.300 align:middle line:10%
but then we've got the
transformation from Scorpio,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.710 align:middle line:10%
and then the longevity and
permanence from Saturn.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.090 align:middle line:90%
So I was very excited.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sounds like we
picked the exact right

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.290 align:middle line:90%
moment intuitively.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Exactly.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.859 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a whole
different take on astrology.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So give me an idea of
how, A, you first started

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:84%
discovering this in charts,
and is there other validation,

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, has anyone else
looked at charts in this way?

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well,
it's hard to say.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.430 align:middle line:84%
I haven't encountered
somebody at this point.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.590 align:middle line:90%
I do know a lot of astrologers.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Really, it started with a
very good friend of mine

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.060 align:middle line:84%
had an intense experience,
is a UFO experiencer.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.310 align:middle line:90%
That's really the term.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.180 align:middle line:84%
She had an experience, and so
then that opened my eyes to it.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And just as a friend,
I looked at her chart,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.840 align:middle line:84%
and I started to
see some things.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:90%
And it was so helpful to her.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.530 align:middle line:84%
I started meeting through
her other UFO experiencers.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.940 align:middle line:90%
I started doing their charts.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And so one thing led to
another, and when I really

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:84%
started to look at the charts,
I just saw so many similarities,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:90%
it was really startling.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And then my work
brought me in touch

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.450 align:middle line:84%
with Paula Harris, who puts
together these wonderful UFO

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.570 align:middle line:90%
symposiums.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And she's really
responsible for my sharing

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.585 align:middle line:90%
my work with the public.

00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So-- well, and
she introduced us,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:84%
and we're both going to be
speaking at the Laughlin

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Conference this
November 14th and 15th.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And so when-- she told me you
were an astounding astrologer,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.910 align:middle line:84%
just from her own
experience, and so when

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.300 align:middle line:84%
I heard about this overlay
to it, I thought OK, bingo.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm sure many
people watching this today

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.310 align:middle line:84%
would love to be able to see
what those factors are, where

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.570 align:middle line:84%
they sit in the chart,
and see whether or not

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.010 align:middle line:84%
this is something they might
be predisposed to themselves.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And let me ask you this question
before we even get going.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:84%
There people that
have overt contact,

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.410 align:middle line:84%
there are people who have
experiences that they're

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.220 align:middle line:84%
experiencing or perceiving
as abduction experiences.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, this whole
issue has been so clouded

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.630 align:middle line:84%
on so many levels, but then
there's the internal experience

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.620 align:middle line:84%
and other dimensional
experience of contact

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:90%
with these other beings as well.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.300 align:middle line:84%
How do you adjust for
that, or does it all

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:90%
look the same in the chart?

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: No, no, it
doesn't all look the same.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.500 align:middle line:90%
There are many different types.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And even some of the charts that
I brought, one of the charts

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.540 align:middle line:84%
you'll see a couple
who actually lost time.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And this happens quite
often where somebody's

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.330 align:middle line:84%
somewhere and then all of a
sudden they're somewhere else,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and they have no idea what
happened or how they got there.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is really--
that comes to play

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.940 align:middle line:90%
with Uranus a little bit.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
the other experience

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.700 align:middle line:84%
where they're seeing
a ship, and there is--

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.180 align:middle line:84%
and then, if there's
contact, quite often

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Pluto comes into play.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.034 align:middle line:90%
So there are subtleties.

00:05:09.034 --> 00:05:10.575 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There are
nuances in there.

00:05:10.575 --> 00:05:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Absolutely.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: And astrology in
general is full of nuance.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And then how would
you determine that

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.920 align:middle line:84%
from people who have
regular contact with beings

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.321 align:middle line:90%
in other dimensional realms?

00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Does that look like
something else in the chart?

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well, that's
a great question.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.045 align:middle line:90%
Neptune really comes into play.

00:05:29.045 --> 00:05:29.545 align:middle line:90%
Neptune--

00:05:29.545 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.066 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yeah.

00:05:31.066 --> 00:05:33.884 align:middle line:84%
Neptune rules Pisces,
rules the Twelfth House

00:05:33.884 --> 00:05:34.800 align:middle line:90%
of Self-Transcendence.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.090 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's all about how
can we transcend reality.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we have a lot of Pisces
in our chart, a strong Neptune,

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.030 align:middle line:84%
there's that desire
to transcend.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it--
and I should also

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.590 align:middle line:84%
mention at this
point-- every planet,

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.967 align:middle line:84%
every sign has a high
road and a low road.

00:05:51.967 --> 00:05:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.758 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: There's a duality.

00:05:53.758 --> 00:05:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So Neptune's neither
good nor bad;

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.920 align:middle line:84%
it's all about-- I encourage
my clients to then embrace

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.420 align:middle line:90%
the highest manifestation.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Because quite often,
when you lack awareness,

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.780 align:middle line:84%
that's when the escapism of
Neptune can come into play.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Because you want so much to
experience something that's

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.940 align:middle line:84%
different, you could even
do it in an unhealthy way

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.420 align:middle line:90%
and develop addictions.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.585 align:middle line:84%
But if you have awareness,
then through meditation

00:06:19.585 --> 00:06:23.230 align:middle line:84%
or through being open to
healthier forms of that, then

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.830 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden you have this
self-transcendent experience.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of transcendence
or transformation,

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.670 align:middle line:84%
we're going to start off
on the topic of Pluto

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.250 align:middle line:90%
as the transformer.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And you say that
this shines light

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.040 align:middle line:84%
on a lot of taboo
subjects, and let's just

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.337 align:middle line:90%
go into some depth on Pluto now.

00:06:42.337 --> 00:06:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, sure.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.000 align:middle line:90%
Pluto is the most important.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.630 align:middle line:90%
Pluto rules Scorpio.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of my clients who have
the most intense experiences

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.440 align:middle line:90%
are actually Scorpio rising.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.870 align:middle line:84%
They often have Scorpio in
some of their personal planets.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But why is Scorpio
rising as opposed to Scorpio

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.500 align:middle line:90%
sun or moon?

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: That is
a great question.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Your rising sign, that
is your Ascendant.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And Sue Tompkins describes it
as the front door of your house.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.270 align:middle line:90%
It's what people see first.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So when you meet somebody,
even though your sun

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:84%
could be in playful,
curious Gemini,

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.180 align:middle line:84%
if you're Scorpio rising, you're
going to have an intensity.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
a power to you that's

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.470 align:middle line:90%
nothing like your Gemini sun.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:84%
But because it's
your rising sign,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.917 align:middle line:90%
you're not really aware of it.

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't even
know what their rising sign

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.410 align:middle line:84%
is until they have
their chart done.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Whereas most people know their
sun sign, because it's popular

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and you can read your
horoscope, it's very popular.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.330 align:middle line:90%
And that is the energy.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're not
aware of something,

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.385 align:middle line:84%
you're not really able to use
it to its fullest potential.

00:07:46.385 --> 00:07:47.710 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And Scorpio rising is one of
the most challenging rising

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.240 align:middle line:84%
signs because it's really these
people come in on a mission.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And even if you
have a Scorpio sun,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.130 align:middle line:84%
the theme is-- I say I know you
have some very strong Scorpio.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:00.622 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lots of Scorpio.

00:08:00.622 --> 00:08:01.246 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:08:01.246 --> 00:08:04.340 align:middle line:84%
You have very strong
Scorpio energy.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about the
theme of transformation,

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.600 align:middle line:84%
is that is the
theme of your life.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And you are open, you're
embracing transformation,

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly what
I tell my clients when

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.150 align:middle line:84%
I see Scorpio energy,
Scorpio rising,

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.730 align:middle line:84%
saying intense experiences
will come to you.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Transformation, opportunities
to transform yourself

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.100 align:middle line:90%
will come to you.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.100 align:middle line:90%
Take them.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Don't run away from them
because sometimes they

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:90%
run the other way.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:28.933 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:28.933 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: They don't
want to say that.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Scorpio is not
afraid of the truth.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.179 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they want
to know the truth.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:39.100 align:middle line:84%
However scary, however difficult
the truth may be, they want it;

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.480 align:middle line:90%
they can take it.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And then the highest
manifestation

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:84%
is once you've transformed
yourself to share that

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and to help transform
society for the better.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:84%
When we look at some of
the great transformers,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Gandhi, even though he
wasn't Scorpio rising,

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.690 align:middle line:84%
he had a lot of
Scorpio in this chart.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.500 align:middle line:84%
His Mars was in Scorpio in
exact opposition to Pluto.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.080 align:middle line:84%
He used his energy
to transform society.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.700 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And interestingly,
if you don't run away

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.049 align:middle line:84%
from-- when no matter what
the sign, I would suppose--

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:12.020 align:middle line:84%
but if you don't run away
from these opportunities

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:84%
for transformation-- we
were talking off camera.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.010 align:middle line:84%
In my case, it's
as though you're

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:84%
living many lifetimes
within one lifetime.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.720 align:middle line:84%
When I think back on
certain phases of life

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and what that was about,
it's so distant from what

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:84%
is now that it is though
it's a different incarnation.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And this happens every
few years really.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: And
that-- and you really

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.720 align:middle line:84%
hit on something, a very
important quality about Pluto.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.050 align:middle line:84%
It represents death,
rebirth, regeneration.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And so part of
that transformation

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.937 align:middle line:84%
is a series of endings
and new beginnings,

00:09:45.937 --> 00:09:48.020 align:middle line:84%
but you don't ever have
to be afraid of the ending

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.340 align:middle line:84%
with Scorpio because there's
always a new beginning.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.960 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if you know
what, this foundation that you

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:84%
created is a little shaky, it's
not your permanent foundation.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.420 align:middle line:84%
So Pluto comes in,
it tears it down

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:90%
so you can rebuild it better.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.636 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to be
afraid of any of those changes

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:03.970 align:middle line:90%
with Scorpio.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.511 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well now, let's take
a moment before we go on here.

00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Where Pluto comes into
someone's chart, what

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.930 align:middle line:84%
would be some of the
signs, for example,

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:16.180 align:middle line:84%
rising signs, that would
have difficulty with Pluto,

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.390 align:middle line:84%
would tend to more run away
and need to be alerted?

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Libra.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:21.310 align:middle line:90%
Libra.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Libra is--and it's
very interesting--

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.100 align:middle line:84%
I actually included one of
my client's chart precisely

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.980 align:middle line:84%
because he has several planets
in Libra and then he's Scorpio

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:30.529 align:middle line:90%
rising.

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: And this was--

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
internal conflict.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Exactly.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually interesting
because both Gandhi and Jimmy

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Carter, they have
a lot of Libra,

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.070 align:middle line:84%
but they have the
strong Scorpio.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you learn, it can be very
difficult because sometimes

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Libras, they don't
really want to see

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.350 align:middle line:90%
anything that's not beautiful.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:56.760 align:middle line:84%
If the truth is too ugly, they
do turn away a little bit,

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.880 align:middle line:84%
they can be a little
indecisive because there's

00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.940 align:middle line:90%
the low road, high road.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:84%
But the high road of Libra is
diplomacy, is graciousness,

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.090 align:middle line:84%
is equality, a
desire for justice.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And so when you look at
Gandhi and Jimmy Carter,

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.190 align:middle line:84%
they were just full
of wanting equality

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and then the Scorpio comes in
and it allows to transform.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.750 align:middle line:84%
So they were actually able
to diplomatically talk

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:84%
about uncomfortable
truths-- that

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:84%
was their Scorpio-- but in
this diplomatic Libra way.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you can incorporate
it, it's a huge asset,

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.996 align:middle line:90%
but it's very difficult.

00:11:31.996 --> 00:11:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any other
signs that are challenged

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:84%
by Pluto and the notion
of transformation?

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: I think
Gemini a little bit.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Because Gemini can be a
little detached and very--

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.910 align:middle line:84%
it's so playful and
curious that sometimes it

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.300 align:middle line:90%
can just skim over things.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.710 align:middle line:90%
And Pluto goes deep.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.070 align:middle line:84%
Scorpio is deep,
profound, intense.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:58.220 align:middle line:84%
It's about getting to
the root of a problem.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And Geminis can be, oh,
I know enough about that.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK, let's move on.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's move on.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.886 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: I don't need
to know everything.

00:12:04.886 --> 00:12:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A little dark down
at the end of the pool there.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Exactly.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:07.920 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.229 align:middle line:90%
A little goes a long way.

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.010 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk about
it a little bit more

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.160 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what
the job of Pluto

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.115 align:middle line:84%
is and shining the light on
the taboo within culture,

00:12:18.115 --> 00:12:19.960 align:middle line:84%
and within ourselves,
and so forth.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:21.830 align:middle line:90%
That's said beautifully.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Pluto shines a light
on taboo subjects.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And when Pluto comes into
your life as a transit,

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.370 align:middle line:84%
or if it's strong
in your natal chart,

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.320 align:middle line:90%
it is asking you to transform.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:84%
It is asking you to
look at the truth,

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.920 align:middle line:90%
even if it's uncomfortable.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, so to look at, oh, if people
are being abused, if people's

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.070 align:middle line:84%
rights, human rights, are
being abused, whatever it is.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And in my case, a
lot of my clients

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:51.870 align:middle line:84%
are having experience--
they are UFO experiencers.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:84%
These are life
altering experiences.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And truly asking them to
accept new information

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.400 align:middle line:84%
and to try to incorporate that
and know that they're never

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.700 align:middle line:84%
going to be the same,
and that that's OK.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
would be under taboo

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.790 align:middle line:84%
because it's something that's
shrouded in darkness and fear

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.014 align:middle line:90%
at this point in time.

00:13:11.014 --> 00:13:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Absolutely.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:12.880 align:middle line:90%
And yes.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.550 align:middle line:84%
They encounter
resistance, opposition,

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.920 align:middle line:84%
they are ridiculed when they
try to share their story often,

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.070 align:middle line:84%
even by their closest
family and friends.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.490 align:middle line:84%
When they come to me,
they are confused,

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.720 align:middle line:84%
they almost are
ashamed, but they

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.550 align:middle line:84%
know what happened to them, and
they just really are seeking.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:90%
They want to know.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.550 align:middle line:84%
They just keep
trying to-- and then

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.130 align:middle line:84%
they're so happy
to find out, to see

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.347 align:middle line:84%
that there's so much in the
chart and what to do about it.

00:13:40.347 --> 00:13:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, on this
subject also of Pluto,

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:47.420 align:middle line:84%
generationally we
have generations

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:51.260 align:middle line:84%
that we are-- where we're all
under the influence of Pluto

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.610 align:middle line:84%
in a certain way, and
right now those being born

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.821 align:middle line:90%
now are in Pluto in Scorpio.

00:13:57.821 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Is it Pluto in Scorpio
or is it Libra?

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Pluto and Capricorn.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's in
Capricorn already?

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yeah.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:02.718 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:14:02.718 --> 00:14:05.780 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about the Scorpio
generation, when were they?

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, OK.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:84%
The Scorpio generation
is very powerful.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.302 align:middle line:84%
That was about-- if you're
around 20, you're in that--

00:14:12.302 --> 00:14:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was thinking, 18.

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:15.500 align:middle line:90%
You're in that.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great
generation because they

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:22.010 align:middle line:84%
want to change things,
and they are not afraid.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:25.110 align:middle line:84%
They're not afraid
to really dig deep,

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:26.897 align:middle line:84%
get to the root of
a problem, and they

00:14:26.897 --> 00:14:27.980 align:middle line:90%
will be able to transform.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
is the age group

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:30.410 align:middle line:90%
of the Scorpio generation?

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: I would
say about 15, 25.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.554 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 15 to 25?

00:14:35.554 --> 00:14:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yeah.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.300 align:middle line:90%
Or really 20's.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.630 align:middle line:90%
Really, yeah, it could be.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I ask that
because, with everything going

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.210 align:middle line:84%
on in the world, I'm personally
looking to that Scorpio

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:49.140 align:middle line:84%
generation to come through
and do the really big, deep

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.329 align:middle line:90%
transformational kind of change.

00:14:51.329 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And so they're still
young right now,

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:53.828 align:middle line:84%
they're up to their
mid-20's, right?

00:14:53.828 --> 00:14:54.452 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:14:54.452 --> 00:14:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
still kids, OK,

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.240 align:middle line:84%
we've got to cut
them a little slack

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.590 align:middle line:90%
until they get some seasoning.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:00.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And also you were talking
about transformation

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.955 align:middle line:84%
on an emotional, intellectual,
and also a physical level.

00:15:05.955 --> 00:15:07.076 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.076 --> 00:15:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Because often when I
talk about, oh, Pluto

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.500 align:middle line:84%
represents death and
rebirth, people panic.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.200 align:middle line:84%
They think, oh my
god, I'm going to die,

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.680 align:middle line:84%
or who's going to
die that I know?

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:90%
It does not mean literal death.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.970 align:middle line:84%
You could have emotional
transformation,

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:90%
intellectual transformation.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.750 align:middle line:90%
There are all different kinds.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.764 align:middle line:84%
And so really that rebirth, you
have to not be literal with it.

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And not be afraid.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: And not be afraid.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.650 align:middle line:84%
No, in fact, Scorpio,
I mean that means

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.427 align:middle line:84%
even if you get sick,
Scorpio regenerates.

00:15:38.427 --> 00:15:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: It's one of
the strongest signs.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.030 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
you won't get sick,

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.065 align:middle line:84%
but you have a great
chance of-- you regenerate;

00:15:44.065 --> 00:15:45.329 align:middle line:90%
you're very strong.

00:15:45.329 --> 00:15:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Now then you start looking
toward the Eighth House.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:90%
Why the Eighth House?

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Because Scorpio rules
the Eighth House.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you have planets
in the Eighth House,

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.530 align:middle line:84%
even if you don't have
any planets in Scorpio,

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:01.330 align:middle line:84%
even if Pluto's not doing
anything in your chart,

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.270 align:middle line:84%
if you have prominent personal
planets in your Eighth House,

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.710 align:middle line:84%
or a lot of them,
that's going to give you

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:07.911 align:middle line:90%
that Scorpio energy.

00:16:07.911 --> 00:16:09.410 align:middle line:84%
That is the House
of Transformation.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:10.430 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.640 align:middle line:84%
That is where-- so say if
your sun is in your Eighth

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.470 align:middle line:84%
House, wherever your
sun is, that's your ego.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.180 align:middle line:90%
You need to feel illuminated.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:84%
You need to illuminate
that energy.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So if it's in The
Eighth House you

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.340 align:middle line:84%
need to experience
transformation

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.225 align:middle line:84%
to illuminate your
very identity.

00:16:25.225 --> 00:16:26.074 align:middle line:90%


00:16:26.074 --> 00:16:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And so all this is leading
up to the profile of someone

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.010 align:middle line:90%
who has had these experiences.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:84%
So we're going one
little aspect at a time.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.012 align:middle line:84%
So then you look at
what's in Pisces.

00:16:38.012 --> 00:16:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, Pisces.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.110 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:40.990 align:middle line:90%
Pisces is important.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.156 align:middle line:84%
Neptune rules Pisces and
it rules the Twelfth House.

00:16:43.156 --> 00:16:44.130 align:middle line:90%
So any of that.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.400 align:middle line:84%
But Pisces is
really-- it's all up--

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.340 align:middle line:84%
it's very magical,
mystical, it's spiritual.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.500 align:middle line:84%
It allows for that higher
consciousness to come in.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And it really is about
self-transcendence,

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and meditation, and that being
able to expand your mind.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.619 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:05.395 align:middle line:90%
Now Uranus.

00:17:05.395 --> 00:17:05.969 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.969 --> 00:17:06.635 align:middle line:90%
Because Uranus--

00:17:06.635 --> 00:17:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, Uranus.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:07.439 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:08.855 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That has
something to do

00:17:08.855 --> 00:17:11.200 align:middle line:84%
with the way in which
someone should or should not

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.024 align:middle line:90%
reveal their story, I take it?

00:17:13.024 --> 00:17:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, that's-- yes.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.300 align:middle line:90%
That's very true.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:90%
Uranus is the great awakener.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.950 align:middle line:84%
It takes 84 years to go
around a chart, so we really,

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.900 align:middle line:84%
most of us, if
we're lucky, we just

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:28.319 align:middle line:84%
get one strong-- we get one
conjunction or one opposition

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:32.110 align:middle line:84%
from Uranus to our main
planets in a lifetime.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.190 align:middle line:90%
So it's a big deal.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And Uranus-- so any time
Uranus hits your chart,

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.840 align:middle line:84%
it awakens it like a
bolt of lightening.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.710 align:middle line:90%
It actually rules electricity.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what I say.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And it rules astrology, it rules
UFOs, it rules metaphysics.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.060 align:middle line:84%
So if Uranus comes in
and awakens your chart,

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:53.627 align:middle line:84%
it's going to awaken you
to those areas, especially.

00:17:53.627 --> 00:17:54.335 align:middle line:90%
And it is sudden.

00:17:54.335 --> 00:17:55.560 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.200 align:middle line:84%
It is disruptive
because it's so sudden.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And with Uranus I always
say expect the unexpected.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:02.930 align:middle line:90%


00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:03.900 align:middle line:90%
That's all you can do.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.810 align:middle line:84%
If you see a Uranus
transit coming,

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:84%
you cannot expect exactly
how it will play out.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:84%
You have to really be free
and embrace the change.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Know change is coming,
and whatever it is,

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.309 align:middle line:90%
you need to embrace it.

00:18:16.309 --> 00:18:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:17.440 align:middle line:90%
No resistance.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.481 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: No resistance.

00:18:18.481 --> 00:18:21.140 align:middle line:84%
That's when people get
sick and things happen.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.200 align:middle line:90%
You need to embrace it.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.980 align:middle line:90%
It's telling you to do that.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happens
when we hit our-- you know,

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:84%
people talk about Saturn returns
and all that-- what happens?

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.770 align:middle line:90%
My dad just turned 84.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
we go through--

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.590 align:middle line:84%
once we complete that
full Uranus cycle?

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well, it is a
completion, it is a cycle.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think we even talked
about this at one point,

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:45.100 align:middle line:84%
that it sometimes, I
mean my grandmother's 98,

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and so it's all about
how you look at it.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't at
all mean that that's

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.050 align:middle line:90%
going to be a completion.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.300 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes
people do feel, oh ,

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.510 align:middle line:84%
that that's really a complete
cycle and so the 84th year is

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:00.310 align:middle line:84%
significant because you want to
just be aware and just be ready

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:01.819 align:middle line:90%
for the next transit.

00:19:01.819 --> 00:19:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to start
looking at some charts.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:05.210 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So first we're coming up
with the chart of Isabella,

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:08.640 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.656 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, Isabella.

00:19:09.656 --> 00:19:10.155 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:10.155 --> 00:19:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Isabella is-- yes.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
about her situation

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.540 align:middle line:84%
first, and her back
story, then we'll

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.512 align:middle line:90%
look at what's shown there.

00:19:17.512 --> 00:19:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: I've known
Isabella for many--

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.000 align:middle line:90%
she's a long term client.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And I've known her
for a long time.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.450 align:middle line:90%
She's had many experiences.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:28.130 align:middle line:90%
And she's actually had contact.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So she's-- it's a
very special chart.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.810 align:middle line:84%
She had her-- So
just the background.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.930 align:middle line:84%
She had her first experience
when she was about eight.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And she actually saw--
it was in her room--

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.630 align:middle line:84%
and she actually saw an
E.T. That was in her room,

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.910 align:middle line:84%
only partially, that
was sort of coming

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.430 align:middle line:90%
in and out of a dimension.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating
because at the time

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.900 align:middle line:84%
she was undergoing a
major Neptune transit.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And Neptune, it really
allows for that outer body,

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.500 align:middle line:90%
that self-transcendence.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.760 align:middle line:90%


00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So that was her first,
that was her first example.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.910 align:middle line:10%
She's had several examples.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:08.430 align:middle line:10%
The one that-- I'm also
including her husband's chart

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.421 align:middle line:10%
because it's so interesting
to have a couple

00:20:10.421 --> 00:20:11.670 align:middle line:10%
together experience something.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll look at
that one after this one.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.861 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Exactly.

00:20:13.861 --> 00:20:14.850 align:middle line:90%


00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.530 align:middle line:90%
And so she's also lost time.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.580 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And she's had many
experiences where

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:24.610 align:middle line:84%
she's able to experience both
self-transcendence and real

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:25.110 align:middle line:90%
awakenings.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.839 align:middle line:90%


00:20:25.839 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.740 align:middle line:84%
So tell us where that
shows up in this chart.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.182 align:middle line:90%
And is this her natal chart?

00:20:31.182 --> 00:20:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: This is
her natal chart.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And the natal chart,
that's a snapshot

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.480 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos the
moment you're born.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.525 align:middle line:90%
It does not change.

00:20:37.525 --> 00:20:38.550 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:39.120 align:middle line:90%
It is fixed.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
is the planets move,

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.200 align:middle line:84%
they make transits, and
they can awaken that energy.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So looking at this natal chart,
if you look at the number 1459

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.320 align:middle line:90%
on the left side.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.260 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.381 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At 9 o'clock.

00:20:51.381 --> 00:20:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: At 9 o'clock.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:54.230 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's a good way to do it.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So at 9 o'clock
she's Scorpio rising.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.170 align:middle line:84%
So right there she's
come in-- she's

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.954 align:middle line:84%
come in with a mission,
a mission to transform.

00:21:01.954 --> 00:21:03.870 align:middle line:84%
It's all about when is
she going to take that?

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:84%
When is she going to
accept the mission?

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:09.122 align:middle line:90%
Now, so Pluto rules Scorpio.

00:21:09.122 --> 00:21:10.830 align:middle line:84%
So then I looked at,
well, where's Pluto?

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
chart ruler and that's

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.080 align:middle line:90%
going to be very significant.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:19.336 align:middle line:84%
Pluto is at the top of the
chart, where it says 1941.

00:21:19.336 --> 00:21:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 12 o'clock.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:21.001 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Exactly.

00:21:21.001 --> 00:21:22.000 align:middle line:90%
At 12 o'clock.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see it's
within a minute

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.390 align:middle line:90%
of her Midheaven, the MC.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:29.210 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
prominent position.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.560 align:middle line:84%
It's the beginning
of your Tenth House.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:36.170 align:middle line:84%
The Tenth House is how people
see you who do not know you.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Basically, that's
your public persona.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a
prominent planet there,

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:84%
it means that's
part of your destiny

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.670 align:middle line:90%
is to have a public life.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:50.570 align:middle line:84%
So that means, if-- is--
you know, her transformation

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:53.070 align:middle line:84%
experiences,
transforming experiences,

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:84%
she really is supposed to
share them with the public.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, was she
reticent to do that initially?

00:21:59.040 --> 00:21:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:00.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.060 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Everyone, most people are.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.420 align:middle line:90%
It's just normal.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.380 align:middle line:90%
It's completely life altering.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But that's what I
work with them is

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.977 align:middle line:84%
to embrace the transformation,
and we take these steps.

00:22:10.977 --> 00:22:13.185 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And because she
has that at the Midheaven--

00:22:13.185 --> 00:22:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, she's absolutely.

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She needs
to share her stories.

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:17.560 align:middle line:90%
She was born to share her story.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: She was born to share
this story because it is exact.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:84%
The closer the aspect,
the stronger it is.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.340 align:middle line:84%
So Scorpio's there,
Pluto is up there,

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:84%
it's just-- and even
her sun in Sagittarius,

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Sag rules the Ninth House of
Higher Learning and Philosophy.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And even that is about
expansion of mind.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And her Mars, at the bottom
of the chart, at 6 o'clock,

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:90%
is in Aquarius.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.370 align:middle line:90%
And Aquarius, Uranus rules that.

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:48.565 align:middle line:84%
And that's all about
astrology, metaphysics.

00:22:48.565 --> 00:22:50.300 align:middle line:90%


00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's really all
throughout her chart.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.260 align:middle line:84%
But she can actually
have a lot of power,

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I'm
working with her on.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.803 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: It's a
very powerful chart.

00:22:58.803 --> 00:23:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, if you didn't
know about these abduction

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.880 align:middle line:84%
experiences, and this
wasn't part of your work,

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:84%
if you were an astrologist
looking at it as a chart,

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.930 align:middle line:84%
what would you say
about this person?

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: What you see,
you see opportunities.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.000 align:middle line:84%
You can look at this
chart and say oh, OK.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.280 align:middle line:84%
This person will
have opportunities

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.710 align:middle line:90%
that are incredibly intense.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.670 align:middle line:84%
She will come face to
face with taboo subjects,

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and it will-- and
she will be called on

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.295 align:middle line:84%
to shine a light on them
because of her Pluto.

00:23:33.295 --> 00:23:35.670 align:middle line:84%
You can't really say-- there
are a lot of taboo subjects.

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.080 align:middle line:84%
I can't say for sure
that that's going to be,

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.404 align:middle line:84%
but it's not at all
surprising, then--

00:23:40.404 --> 00:23:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That it turns out.

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:43.818 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, so that
would be a consistent-- OK.

00:23:43.818 --> 00:23:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's her husband we're
going to be looking at?

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at the next one.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: So, even
in Ferdinand's.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, look at how
similar this is over here.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:52.358 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Yeah, it's
really interesting.

00:23:52.358 --> 00:23:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Even Ferdinand's chart-- now,
he has a lot more Neptune

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:56.250 align:middle line:90%
influence.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:24:00.760 align:middle line:84%
You see around where we
talk about the Ascendant,

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.599 align:middle line:90%
around 9 o'clock.

00:24:01.599 --> 00:24:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just above 9 o'clock.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:04.431 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, just
above 9 o'clock,

00:24:04.431 --> 00:24:07.650 align:middle line:84%
he has two planets
in his Twelfth House.

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:09.840 align:middle line:84%
That's going to bring
in that Piscean energy

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.756 align:middle line:90%
of self-transcendence.

00:24:10.756 --> 00:24:11.460 align:middle line:90%


00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Even more importantly,
what's in between,

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.610 align:middle line:84%
it looks like a
little horseshoe,

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.550 align:middle line:84%
that's what we call
the North Node.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.650 align:middle line:90%
That represents one's destiny.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So wherever that
is, that tells me

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:27.960 align:middle line:84%
that's part of the
destiny of that person.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.670 align:middle line:84%
For him to achieve
his destiny, he really

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:32.690 align:middle line:84%
needs to experience
self-transcendence.

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:34.150 align:middle line:90%


00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:36.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's how you know that
he will have the opportunity

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:37.840 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And also, a little bit
further down in the chart,

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.430 align:middle line:84%
he has a very strong
Neptune that's

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:46.710 align:middle line:84%
right in between his
sun and his Mercury.

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
going to intensify

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:53.745 align:middle line:84%
that Neptunian magical,
mystical element in his chart.

00:24:53.745 --> 00:24:54.950 align:middle line:90%


00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And he's got a very
prominent Midheaven.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.100 align:middle line:90%
He's got several planets.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:24:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Which
just means this is

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:84%
going to affect how people
see him who don't know him.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.585 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gemini?

00:25:05.585 --> 00:25:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:06.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In Gemini.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: That gives
a lot of flexibility.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.020 align:middle line:90%
Gemini is mutable.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So it tells me he's going to
respond a little more easily

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.190 align:middle line:90%
to an unusual experience.

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, now
between he and Isabella,

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.155 align:middle line:84%
did they have joint
experiences or separate?

00:25:23.155 --> 00:25:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, they did.

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.735 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: They had
a joint experience.

00:25:24.735 --> 00:25:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's talk about
that and how each of them,

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:28.543 align:middle line:84%
looking at their chart
and knowing them,

00:25:28.543 --> 00:25:29.470 align:middle line:90%
would have handled it.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's-- yeah,
that's a great question.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:32.599 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:32.599 --> 00:25:35.410 align:middle line:84%
So with-- and at the
time, the transits

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.270 align:middle line:90%
also reveal what was going on.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Now, he also has Libra.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.477 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.477 --> 00:25:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So even though he wants
self-transcendence--

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:43.367 align:middle line:90%


00:25:43.367 --> 00:25:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He'd go
in resistance a bit?

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:46.783 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: He can have
a little bit of that.

00:25:46.783 --> 00:25:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Even with all of
his flexibility,

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.590 align:middle line:84%
he's going to be a
little bit more well,

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:51.690 align:middle line:90%
let's really go over this.

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:52.570 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's see.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:53.920 align:middle line:90%


00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.010 align:middle line:90%
What really happened here?

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:55.865 align:middle line:90%
Let's really--

00:25:55.865 --> 00:25:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Let's get
this timeline down,

00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:59.100 align:middle line:90%
and could it be anything else?

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Analyze it to death?

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Exactly.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.330 align:middle line:84%
That gives you--
they want to be fair.

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:03.705 align:middle line:84%
He wants to be
fair and balanced.

00:26:03.705 --> 00:26:04.710 align:middle line:90%


00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:07.570 align:middle line:84%
But during-- when
he had the transit,

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:11.734 align:middle line:84%
they basically-- they were
driving on the highway,

00:26:11.734 --> 00:26:13.400 align:middle line:84%
and it was around
3:00 in the afternoon.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.910 align:middle line:90%
So it was nice and light out.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:18.030 align:middle line:84%
The next thing they knew,
it was 9 o'clock at night,

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.330 align:middle line:90%
so it was dark.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:84%
They were driving on
an old country road,

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and when they looked out
the window, there were cows.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.130 align:middle line:84%
They were driving
past a dairy farm.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:32.127 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine that they
just-- they knew something--

00:26:32.127 --> 00:26:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:34.001 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Really big happened.

00:26:34.001 --> 00:26:36.110 align:middle line:90%
They completely lost time.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And it had not been Isabella's
first time doing this,

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:42.470 align:middle line:84%
but it was Ferdinand's
first time with her.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And so when I looked
at the transits--

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:48.750 align:middle line:84%
now he has all of the
Neptunian and the Pisces.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:52.760 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense that his
experience was of losing time.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Because that really
rules, that being able to

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.700 align:middle line:90%
transcend in that way.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:04.750 align:middle line:84%
He was having major Pluto
transits at the time of-- Pluto

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.930 align:middle line:90%
was squaring his sun.

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:11.610 align:middle line:84%
It was asking him your
identity is about to change.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was challenging
his identity through the square.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:14.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: His very identity.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.201 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: And it's
saying you're not

00:27:18.201 --> 00:27:20.699 align:middle line:84%
just married to someone
who's experienced this,

00:27:20.699 --> 00:27:21.990 align:middle line:90%
who's experienced these things.

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.610 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be a partner
with her in the truest sense,

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:28.500 align:middle line:90%
and you now have an experience.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And it really asked him, on
the most fundamental level,

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.250 align:middle line:90%
to truly transform.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.040 align:middle line:90%


00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, she was having Uranus
coming in at that time

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.550 align:middle line:90%
and awakening her Ascendant.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And that was really-- she
became much more focused

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.100 align:middle line:90%
after that incident.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Because Uranus is such
a bolt of lightning,

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.120 align:middle line:90%
you're just not the same.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.850 align:middle line:90%
She was just electrified by it.

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And so you could
just feel the energy

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.880 align:middle line:84%
when you talked to her
about this experience.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.300 align:middle line:84%
With him, it was
a much deeper, it

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.250 align:middle line:84%
was a much-- I'd been
hearing about these

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:04.008 align:middle line:84%
and I always believed
her but-- you know,

00:28:04.008 --> 00:28:06.540 align:middle line:84%
it was that kind of
profound transformation.

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:07.577 align:middle line:90%


00:28:07.577 --> 00:28:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: And that's also
part of the transit that

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:11.300 align:middle line:90%
was happening.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.216 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:28:12.216 --> 00:28:15.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, now before we go, just a
quick question about the North

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.626 align:middle line:84%
Node, as you say just
above 9 o'clock there.

00:28:18.626 --> 00:28:20.505 align:middle line:84%
You know, a common
perception of it

00:28:20.505 --> 00:28:23.540 align:middle line:84%
is that it has more to
do with, you say destiny,

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:24.910 align:middle line:90%
but to do with future.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's even been
interpreted that maybe

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:32.610 align:middle line:84%
in another incarnation one might
move into that North Node sign.

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:33.580 align:middle line:90%
How do you view it?

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.860 align:middle line:90%
What is the North Node?

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well, just as
you have a North Node,

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:38.390 align:middle line:90%
you also have a South Node.

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.973 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:38.973 --> 00:28:41.807 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: So normally South
Node is a past life experience.

00:28:41.807 --> 00:28:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: If you
come in, you come

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:47.570 align:middle line:84%
into the life with
those talents.

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Whatever area the
South Node is in,

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.240 align:middle line:90%
you can do that in your sleep.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people
keep following

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:55.250 align:middle line:90%
that path because it's so easy.

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.142 align:middle line:84%
The North Node is really where
you're supposed to be going.

00:28:58.142 --> 00:28:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Who knows when you're
going to get there,

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:02.370 align:middle line:84%
but you at least need
to make the effort.

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that, if
you see that in your chart

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:06.860 align:middle line:84%
and you're a student
of your own chart,

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.870 align:middle line:84%
you would look at
your North Node

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.530 align:middle line:84%
and say what are the
attributes of that sign?

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I need to begin opening
myself into these attributes?

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Absolutely.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:15.930 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:16.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's a great--

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
talked about very often.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.008 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: I know,
and it's so important.

00:29:20.008 --> 00:29:21.080 align:middle line:90%
It's really revealing.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.580 align:middle line:90%
It's really significant.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.290 align:middle line:84%
It can really help,
especially if you're

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:26.220 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out,
well, what should I do?

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.760 align:middle line:90%
There are two paths.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.650 align:middle line:90%
It can really help to focus you.

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that is
such useful information.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:32.860 align:middle line:90%


00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:33.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:37.025 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to look at
I think it's Peter's chart.

00:29:37.025 --> 00:29:37.775 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, OK.

00:29:37.775 --> 00:29:38.275 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:38.275 --> 00:29:38.917 align:middle line:90%
Peter has--

00:29:38.917 --> 00:29:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's all this?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000 align:middle line:84%
This is a little different
with all of the blue.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:42.624 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:29:42.624 --> 00:29:44.635 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Looks like
little stars or X's there.

00:29:44.635 --> 00:29:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Those are extiles.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sextiles.

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Those are
opportunity aspects.

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:49.810 align:middle line:90%
Those are 60 degree aspects.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.370 align:middle line:90%


00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.550 align:middle line:84%
People who are born
with these aspects,

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:57.710 align:middle line:84%
they have a lot of creativity
and a lot of opportunities

00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:58.840 align:middle line:90%
to do things.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, he has an
absolutely amazing chart.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:05.150 align:middle line:84%
This is the client I
was-- he's simlar to-- he

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:08.029 align:middle line:84%
has similar aspects to
Gandhi and Jimmy Carter.

00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: It's
really fascinating.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:15.810 align:middle line:84%
You see all the Libra up
there around 10 o'clock.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:19.570 align:middle line:84%
He has his sun and Jupiter,
Mars, all in Libra,

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:23.110 align:middle line:84%
that's the diplomacy, the
graciousness, the charm.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.604 align:middle line:84%
And then, you go down a little
bit, he's Scorpio rising.

00:30:25.604 --> 00:30:26.645 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Scorpio rising.

00:30:26.645 --> 00:30:28.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a lot of Scorpio there.

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: It's amazing how
many Scorpio rising clients.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And he's even, just within
a couple of degrees,

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:35.440 align:middle line:90%
his Ascendant of Isabella's.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And so we would even say
their Ascendance are conjunct.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.890 align:middle line:90%
It's very unusual.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:41.260 align:middle line:90%
So he's Scorpio rising.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.120 align:middle line:90%
He came in with that mission.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.250 align:middle line:90%
He's got all that Libra.

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And then he's also--
he has the Pisces.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:52.210 align:middle line:84%
If you go down at 6 o'clock,
that's a-- he's a Pisces moon.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: And then
his Pisces moon,

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.990 align:middle line:84%
he also then has a
prominent Twelfth House.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.360 align:middle line:90%
Neptune is in his Twelfth House.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And look, as with
Ferdinand, his North Node

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:05.310 align:middle line:90%
is in his Twelfth House.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So this was really
his destiny, to have

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.825 align:middle line:90%
a self-transcendent experience.

00:31:10.825 --> 00:31:12.241 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
his experience?

00:31:12.241 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: His experience
was he had contact.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:18.250 align:middle line:90%
He first saw a ship.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And then they-- he basically
was able to communicate

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:22.589 align:middle line:90%
with the ship.

00:31:22.589 --> 00:31:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Telepathically?

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
that communication.

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And it completely turned
his world upside down.

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Because he had been
living through his Libra.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And also, if you notice,
his sun and Jupiter exactly

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.990 align:middle line:90%
conjunct at 12 Libra 8 minutes.

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And any time Jupiter
touches a planet, Jupiter

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.550 align:middle line:90%
expands anything it touches.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:46.890 align:middle line:90%
It brings optimism.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.540 align:middle line:90%
It rules Sagittarius.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.670 align:middle line:90%
It's fun.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And so he was really just
this really fun, charming--

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.511 align:middle line:84%
he was really delving more
into the superficial Libra

00:31:58.511 --> 00:31:59.010 align:middle line:90%
qualities.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.690 align:middle line:90%


00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And everything was a good time,
and everything was a party.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And he had no idea of
his Scorpio Ascendant.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.850 align:middle line:84%
He hadn't really
paid much attention.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, the
Pisces moon can also,

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:14.230 align:middle line:84%
if you don't pay attention,
it can create addictions

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:16.060 align:middle line:90%
and then it dulls the senses.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.530 align:middle line:84%
So this experience--
and also, look.

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Pluto's at the top of his
chart, as in with Isabella.

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:27.539 align:middle line:84%
So this completely awakened
his Scorpio rising energy.

00:32:27.539 --> 00:32:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So now, he's in
contact with beings

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.170 align:middle line:90%
telepathically in a ship.

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:35.770 align:middle line:84%
What was the nature of the
communication, the experience,

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and what did he do
with it afterward?

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well, it
basically-- he just

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.600 align:middle line:84%
felt that he was getting--
he felt that he was getting

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:50.470 align:middle line:84%
messages of-- to share,
to share the story.

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:52.795 align:middle line:84%
To be saying will you
share this experience.

00:32:52.795 --> 00:32:53.930 align:middle line:90%


00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And he was absolutely distraught
when he came to see me.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was so
uncomfortable for him.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.040 align:middle line:90%


00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:06.375 align:middle line:84%
And it was really-- it's
been a very slow process.

00:33:06.375 --> 00:33:08.682 align:middle line:90%


00:33:08.682 --> 00:33:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because he
was a good time boy.

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, exactly.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:12.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A Libra.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's just-- it's
just learning new parts.

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Had to man up a bit.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:17.631 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Exactly.

00:33:17.631 --> 00:33:18.139 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:18.139 --> 00:33:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking-- one thing
I'm noticing with these charts,

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:26.060 align:middle line:84%
all of them seem to have
most of the activity, the few

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.730 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen,
in the Midheaven.

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:30.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean, above the horizon.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Above the horizon.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.410 align:middle line:84%
That's-- It's-- The chart,
obviously there are 12 houses.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So we can divide it
like that, but we also

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:42.480 align:middle line:84%
do divide the chart between
the upper and the lower part.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.150 align:middle line:84%
In the upper houses, as you
said, with the Midheaven,

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:48.400 align:middle line:84%
anything that's above the
Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth,

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Eleventh, Twelfth, that really
has to do with your connection

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:56.570 align:middle line:84%
to your community, to
society, to the public.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Everything below
is very internal.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And so when planets are above
the chart in those houses,

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.969 align:middle line:84%
it's really saying you are
supposed to be in the public.

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:12.719 align:middle line:84%
You know, your experiences,
your ideas, something about you

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:14.760 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be
public, and you're

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:18.389 align:middle line:84%
supposed to
contribute to society.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:22.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not just going to be
an individual experience.

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do you notice
in most of the charts

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.219 align:middle line:84%
you do where people have
had these experiences

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:32.626 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of their houses that
are full are above the horizon?

00:34:32.626 --> 00:34:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:36.311 align:middle line:84%
Especially a lot with
prominent 10th and 12th.

00:34:36.311 --> 00:34:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Because Twelfth is the
self-transcendence.

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.260 align:middle line:90%


00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Tenth is so important.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And then the Ascendant
is just very important,

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and any conjunctions
to the Ascendant.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.155 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Remind us
about the Eleventh House,

00:34:48.155 --> 00:34:50.870 align:middle line:84%
which is two up from 9 o'clock
there, where all of his Libra

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:51.370 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, well the
Eleventh House-- well, oh, I'm

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:55.180 align:middle line:90%
glad you asked that.

00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:58.570 align:middle line:84%
That is the house of--
represents our friends.

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:02.500 align:middle line:84%
It also represents any
organization we belong to.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And what's great about this is
that he-- because you can tell

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.350 align:middle line:84%
he loves to belong
to organizations,

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:09.580 align:middle line:90%
he's OK with that.

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And he now belongs
to Paula's organi--

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:17.280 align:middle line:84%
belongs to-- is really part
of the Symposium Organization.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.690 align:middle line:90%
So he was able to reach out.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which has
to do with contact.

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Exactly.

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he ultimately
embraced it to where he could

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:24.480 align:middle line:90%
step into that community--

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.271 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Exactly.

00:35:25.271 --> 00:35:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And share.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yeah.

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And that was clearly
in his chart.

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And I suggested that he--
because that clearly-- it's

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:34.480 align:middle line:84%
in this chart that he was
going to be open to that.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, with all of
these people and other clients

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:41.110 align:middle line:84%
as well, you touched
on this earlier,

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:44.510 align:middle line:84%
if there's a particular
Pluto transit happening,

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.850 align:middle line:84%
this is going to be when these
breakthrough events occur

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:50.810 align:middle line:84%
in our lives, whether it's
extraterrestrial contact

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:51.370 align:middle line:90%
or otherwise.

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do we identify
that in our chart?

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:53.640 align:middle line:90%
What do we look for?

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, absolutely.

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:55.536 align:middle line:90%
Well that's a transit.

00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.070 align:middle line:84%
You just need to talk
to a good astrologer,

00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:59.070 align:middle line:90%
have your transits done.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:00.519 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And say where's Pluto?

00:36:00.519 --> 00:36:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Exactly.

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you're having
Pluto conjuncting,

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:07.980 align:middle line:84%
squaring, opposing your
sun, that astrologer

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.110 align:middle line:90%
can tell you get ready.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:10.630 align:middle line:84%
You're being asked--
transformation

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:12.130 align:middle line:90%
is coming to you.

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:15.330 align:middle line:84%
If any-- And also, if anything's
not working in your life,

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:17.400 align:middle line:84%
if any relationship
is not working,

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Pluto will come in
and eliminate it.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:21.380 align:middle line:90%


00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:22.222 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:22.222 --> 00:36:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people
going through that right

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.250 align:middle line:90%
now, especially Scorpios.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:26.791 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: And it's
also good to know

00:36:26.791 --> 00:36:28.870 align:middle line:84%
that it's supposed
to be eliminated.

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:30.400 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to mourn it.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:32.691 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: It's something
that should have ended.

00:36:32.691 --> 00:36:34.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And, yes, exactly.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So now if you're ready
to come forth like him,

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:38.780 align:middle line:84%
you're ready to tell your
story, what is it again

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:42.060 align:middle line:84%
about Uranus that plays into
the telling of the story.

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Uranus
is so important.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:47.283 align:middle line:84%
Uranus rules-- it also
rules individuality.

00:36:47.283 --> 00:36:48.350 align:middle line:90%


00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:50.560 align:middle line:90%
It's all about being unique.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.640 align:middle line:84%
It honors-- so when a Uranus
transit comes into your life,

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.730 align:middle line:84%
it's asking you to be
true to your unique voice.

00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:02.050 align:middle line:84%
It's saying it's time to
follow your own path, even

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:04.290 align:middle line:90%
if that path is unpopular.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:90%
And most of the time, it is.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Uranus does not
make you likeable.

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:12.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not about--
That's not what it is.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.520 align:middle line:90%
It's really about reform.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And reform is-- you always
have a lot of opposition,

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's challenging, but if
you have a significant Uranus

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:26.880 align:middle line:84%
transit and a client comes to me
and has this experience and is

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.982 align:middle line:90%
thinking of sharing it--

00:37:27.982 --> 00:37:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Would
that be like Uranus

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.730 align:middle line:84%
opposed to your
sun, or something?

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:31.813 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, absolutely.

00:37:31.813 --> 00:37:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Uranus-- usually opposing,
conjuncting, or squaring

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:36.700 align:middle line:90%
are the most dynamic.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Now when Uranus
sextiles or trines,

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.512 align:middle line:90%
those are very easy aspects.

00:37:40.512 --> 00:37:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those are
advantageous aspects, yeah.

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Exactly.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And that person will
be able to share

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:47.227 align:middle line:84%
with probably being
less unpopular.

00:37:47.227 --> 00:37:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: There'll be
a little easier way.

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:53.030 align:middle line:84%
But usually when these things
happen, it's conjunction.

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:55.130 align:middle line:84%
It's sitting on
top, it's opposing,

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:58.000 align:middle line:84%
it's that electrical,
just lightning rod.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.159 align:middle line:84%
And you really are supposed
to go your own way.

00:38:02.159 --> 00:38:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: You'll flourish more.

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:06.193 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any other thoughts
about-- because we're

00:38:06.193 --> 00:38:08.489 align:middle line:84%
going to take a quick look
at the city of Boulder.

00:38:08.489 --> 00:38:10.780 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at that
little conference coming up

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:14.040 align:middle line:84%
in Laughlin, which is a really
kind of amazing thing that's

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.110 align:middle line:84%
going to be happening
because it's taking the UFO

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Congresses back to
its roots on one

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.070 align:middle line:84%
level, but more into the
consciousness element

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:24.826 align:middle line:84%
than a lot of the
UFO Congresses,

00:38:24.826 --> 00:38:26.700 align:middle line:84%
which are kind of
repeating the same stories.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.537 align:middle line:90%
Now, I go to a lot of them.

00:38:28.537 --> 00:38:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to look
at the both of those.

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:32.670 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
the city of Boulder,

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.150 align:middle line:90%
since we're here in Boulder.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: OK, yes.

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually,
this chart was

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:40.190 align:middle line:84%
created by Shawn Collins, an
astrologer here in Boulder.

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:42.680 align:middle line:84%
When I told him I was
coming, he sent this to me.

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.963 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Once again,
all above the horizon.

00:38:44.963 --> 00:38:46.963 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Oh my gosh,
this is an amazing chart.

00:38:46.963 --> 00:38:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, right away
I saw-- you see

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:54.200 align:middle line:84%
at the top of the chart
you've got the sun and Mercury

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.840 align:middle line:84%
in Aquarius, the
Midheaven is Aquarius.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.720 align:middle line:90%
Aquarius is all about reform.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:59.800 align:middle line:90%


00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Uranus rules Aquarius,
so it's about being

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:07.060 align:middle line:84%
unique, original,
humanitarian, also scientific.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And all of that
describes Boulder.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Also, if you look
at the Ascendant,

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Uranus sits right on top of it.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And so this is just saying, and
it's also saying for Boulder

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:84%
to flourish, it needs
to be true to itself.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.109 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be unique and
original and go its own path.

00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I see
a bunch of Taurus

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.390 align:middle line:84%
there at 9 o'clock
at the Ascendant.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: And that's something
that Shawn was pointing out,

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.280 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know
everything about Boulder.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.070 align:middle line:84%
But he was saying, oh, it's so
fitting that the moon in Taurus

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.660 align:middle line:84%
sits on top of the
Taurus Ascendant

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.360 align:middle line:90%
because it's a Taurean city.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.482 align:middle line:84%
It's all the-- it's very
sensual, all the food,

00:39:38.482 --> 00:39:39.440 align:middle line:90%
there's wonderful food.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.148 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Great food
and amenities scene.

00:39:41.148 --> 00:39:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: And the
connection to nature.

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Because Taurus is the earth and
the ground, and it's stable,

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:50.940 align:middle line:84%
even the name Boulder
is a very Taurean name.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:52.800 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.110 align:middle line:84%
So for anyone who had a
curiosity about coming

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.650 align:middle line:84%
to Boulder, now you know
what you'd be getting into.

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Everything that
has a beginning has a chart.

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, let's
look at that symposium

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:02.660 align:middle line:84%
that we'll both be
doing in November.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.220 align:middle line:90%


00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:04.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.720 align:middle line:90%
Laughlin Symposium.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: This is a really--
this is a really dynamic chart.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And I put this
together for Paula.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, look at all that
at the top, all the green.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:13.918 align:middle line:90%
What's happening there?

00:40:13.918 --> 00:40:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, OK.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.536 align:middle line:90%
Those are squares.

00:40:15.536 --> 00:40:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know,
they're squares.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.193 align:middle line:90%
What's up with that?

00:40:17.193 --> 00:40:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Squares-- I know.

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Normally in an event chart
you want-- you usually

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.160 align:middle line:84%
go for sextiles and
trines, but the problem

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:28.960 align:middle line:84%
with too many sextiles and
trines, if it's a fun event

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.350 align:middle line:84%
or if it's a popular
event, that's fine.

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:36.710 align:middle line:84%
But we're coming together
to do real transformation,

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:40.270 align:middle line:84%
you see all the Scorpio in the
Eleventh House, the sun, Saturn

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:44.220 align:middle line:84%
and Venus and Mercury
are all in Scorpio.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.581 align:middle line:84%
The theme of the conference
is transformation.

00:40:46.581 --> 00:40:47.830 align:middle line:90%
That's going to be very heavy.

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Saturn near the sun,
it's going to be serious.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.304 align:middle line:84%
It's a little similar
to our interview chart.

00:40:52.304 --> 00:40:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
be speaking there,

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:57.190 align:middle line:84%
I think, the day
before my birthday.

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: And that's going to
honor all your Scorpio planets.

00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.968 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: So it's very good.

00:40:59.968 --> 00:41:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it was designed--
yeah, that was destined.

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: The moon
and Jupiter is also

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:06.700 align:middle line:84%
in the Eighth House
of transformation,

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.990 align:middle line:84%
that intensifies
the Scorpio effect,

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:12.930 align:middle line:84%
but it's great to have that fun
Leo, the fun moon and Jupiter

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:13.750 align:middle line:90%
in Leo.

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:15.560 align:middle line:84%
It's we're supposed
to get the word out,

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:19.520 align:middle line:84%
and the Sag Ascendant
is all about publicity.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And I actually shared this
chart with Mary Keswani,

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:25.080 align:middle line:84%
an astrologer in
Louisville, my hometown,

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and she noticed something
really brilliant immediately.

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:31.800 align:middle line:84%
She said oh my goodness, look
at the Mars-Pluto conjunction

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.740 align:middle line:90%
right underneath the Ascendant.

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.290 align:middle line:90%
That's all about transformation.

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:39.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the houses
that those planets rule,

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:42.810 align:middle line:84%
you go down to 6 o'clock,
Mars rules the Fourth House.

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:45.330 align:middle line:84%
That represents
past experiences.

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:49.080 align:middle line:84%
You go up to about 11
o'clock and Scorpio

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.600 align:middle line:84%
rules the Eleventh
House of organizations.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.690 align:middle line:84%
This is a group of
people coming together

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:57.440 align:middle line:84%
to talk about, to
process and understand

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.979 align:middle line:84%
these intense past
experiences and transform.

00:41:59.979 --> 00:42:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which there are going
to be many experiencers there

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:07.360 align:middle line:84%
that go onto ships regularly
and have for many, many years

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.780 align:middle line:84%
and have been given
the vision of what it's

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:11.780 align:middle line:84%
going to look like in our
cosmos in our futures.

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:15.024 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of those
experiencers, well known ones,

00:42:15.024 --> 00:42:15.940 align:middle line:90%
are going to be there.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yeah.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.323 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that totally
goes with what you're saying.

00:42:18.323 --> 00:42:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, exactly.

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:20.596 align:middle line:84%
And I should also say
about the squares.

00:42:20.596 --> 00:42:22.820 align:middle line:84%
So another reason--
so it is very unusual

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:24.070 align:middle line:90%
that there's so many squares.

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:26.360 align:middle line:84%
But one reason-- because
there is opposition

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and this is a taboo subject,
we don't want people to be-- we

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:32.549 align:middle line:84%
don't just want to get together
and pat each other on the back

00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:33.715 align:middle line:90%
and preach to the converted.

00:42:33.715 --> 00:42:35.066 align:middle line:90%


00:42:35.066 --> 00:42:36.350 align:middle line:90%
This is transformation.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:40.260 align:middle line:10%
Because the first step, yes, to
transform ourselves, but anyone

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.450 align:middle line:10%
with Scorpio energy, we
have-- we're on a mission.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:44.990 align:middle line:10%
We have a responsibility
to transform society

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.860 align:middle line:10%
for the better.

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And so these squares
will give that energy

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:52.930 align:middle line:84%
to encourage people to
get out there and share,

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:54.700 align:middle line:90%
and to overcome the resistance.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.040 align:middle line:90%
Because it's very dynamic.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Mars, the planet of energy,
that gives us the energy

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.350 align:middle line:84%
to do something,
is squaring Uranus

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:03.060 align:middle line:90%
and squaring the Midheaven.

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.730 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
a little opposition.

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Some dynamism there.

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:06.436 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yeah.

00:43:06.436 --> 00:43:07.760 align:middle line:90%
So I wanted some squares.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fireworks.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: I wanted
some oomph because we

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:10.780 align:middle line:84%
need to get out there
and do something.

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:11.446 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:11.446 --> 00:43:12.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:13.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.890 align:middle line:84%
So as we kind of wind
toward our conclusion,

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:19.714 align:middle line:84%
how can each one of us start
looking for those possibilities

00:43:19.714 --> 00:43:21.380 align:middle line:84%
of transformation in
each of our charts?

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:23.080 align:middle line:90%
How do we identify that?

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:26.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, we probably need
to find a skilled astrologer,

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:29.900 align:middle line:84%
but if we have our chart sitting
in front of us, what would be,

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.750 align:middle line:84%
as laypeople, what
we would look for?

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:33.541 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: I would
say look for Scorpio.

00:43:33.541 --> 00:43:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So you could look for
the sign of Scorpio.

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:36.590 align:middle line:90%


00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Learn to recognize
the sign of Scorpio.

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Look, do you have any
planets in Scorpio?

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:42.460 align:middle line:90%
Are you Scorpio rising?

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.420 align:middle line:84%
What's going on in
your Eighth House?

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
any of that, then

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:50.320 align:middle line:84%
start to really
embrace transformation.

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.670 align:middle line:90%
Look for those opportunities.

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:52.370 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:53.828 align:middle line:84%
Don't run away from
taboo subjects.

00:43:53.828 --> 00:43:54.345 align:middle line:90%


00:43:54.345 --> 00:43:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't
be a scaredy cat.

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.389 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Don't be a scaredy
cat; embrace transformation.

00:43:58.389 --> 00:43:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, what are you going
to be talking about when

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.630 align:middle line:84%
you're-- What is your
talk going to be about?

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: It's
consciousness and the stars,

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:08.733 align:middle line:90%
the energy of transformation.

00:44:08.733 --> 00:44:09.274 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:09.274 --> 00:44:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: I know,
what a surprise.

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.198 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:44:11.198 --> 00:44:11.910 align:middle line:90%
What a surprise.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:13.470 align:middle line:84%
