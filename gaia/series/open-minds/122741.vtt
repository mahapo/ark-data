>>REGINA MEREDITH: We have
back with us once again

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.080 align:middle line:10%
our favorite
philosopher, Neil Kramer.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.120 align:middle line:10%
I like to call his work
philosophy you can use.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Having studied with different
ancient lineages of knowledge,

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.880 align:middle line:84%
he's come to his own
unique take on how

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:84%
we can recover our integrity
as individuals and societies.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Big task.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Neil.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NEIL KRAMER: Thank you.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big task.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Great to be here.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
the easy fix era seems

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.020 align:middle line:84%
like it's drawing to
a close and it's time

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.460 align:middle line:84%
now for mature thinking,
responsibility,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.110 align:middle line:84%
all the things that
a lot of people

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:84%
have been in the New Age
community for the last 20 years

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:84%
have kind of shoved
aside for a while.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.070 align:middle line:84%
But now it's time
to pay the piper.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.490 align:middle line:90%
We need some clear thinking.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're
really good at that.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
we start with what

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.190 align:middle line:84%
you call a philosophy
of living, the practice

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.740 align:middle line:90%
of truthful unfoldment.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:84%
So let's set the stage
with your definition,

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.380 align:middle line:90%
what you mean by that.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: So in my work,
there is a philosophical angle

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.830 align:middle line:10%
and there's a mystical angle.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:10%
So there's like classical
philosophy of how to think,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.520 align:middle line:10%
what is thought,
what is knowledge,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.170 align:middle line:10%
what is belief, what is being,
which is kind of abstract, kind

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.251 align:middle line:10%
of academic.

00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the mystical angle,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.390 align:middle line:84%
which is to do with
hermetic philosophy,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.860 align:middle line:90%
spirituality, and so on.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:84%
What I'm trying to do is meld
those two things together as

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.315 align:middle line:84%
best I can, and as you say, in a
way that is actually practical,

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:55.440 align:middle line:90%
that you can do stuff with.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.120 align:middle line:90%
It's not just scholarly stuff.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.290 align:middle line:84%
So one thing that I've
come to understand

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.270 align:middle line:84%
of sort of increasing
importance is

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
that in the New Age
paradigm, there's

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.500 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people who don't
really know the difference

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle line:90%
between knowledge and belief.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of beliefs
and there's a lot of information

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.857 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot
of, you know, kind

00:02:23.857 --> 00:02:27.240 align:middle line:84%
of ideas that have got traction
that people just go with.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So in the '60s and
'70s, Eastern, Hindu,

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.780 align:middle line:84%
and Chinese philosophy
has been radically

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:84%
responsible for shaping the
modern spiritual movements,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.660 align:middle line:84%
where everybody talks about
things in Eastern terms,

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:84%
but not many people have
actually seriously looked at it

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and studied it and been
there and examined it.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And then even in the
very, very modern era

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.590 align:middle line:84%
of the '90s and 2000s,
with what we now

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:84%
call the parapolitical movement
and conspiracy and whatnot,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.990 align:middle line:84%
enormous belief
systems that again

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.360 align:middle line:84%
have got traction, but
people don't really

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.714 align:middle line:84%
know the truth of what
they're looking at.

00:03:09.714 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:90%
They just go with something.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:84%
They find a voice or they find
a person, they find a guy,

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.880 align:middle line:84%
they find a woman who has a
conviction and go with it.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So what I try and
do is say, well,

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:84%
let's use some of the
tools of philosophy, so

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.960 align:middle line:84%
the study of being, ontology,
and the study of knowledge,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.270 align:middle line:84%
epistemology, and
try and determine

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.360 align:middle line:90%
how it is we know something.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.529 align:middle line:90%
How do we know a thing?

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:34.820 align:middle line:90%
How do we actually get to that?

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you went to
your philosophy class

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.690 align:middle line:84%
101 at university and
you went on the first day

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:84%
to look at epistemology,
they would say, well,

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:90%
let's give you an example.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.020 align:middle line:90%
What is the sun?

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And people would say, well,
it's a giant fireball.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.470 align:middle line:90%
We all revolve around it.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.232 align:middle line:84%
And it's about 93 million
miles away from the Earth.

00:04:01.232 --> 00:04:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher, the
professor would say, well,

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.495 align:middle line:90%
how do you know that?

00:04:04.495 --> 00:04:05.950 align:middle line:90%
How do you know that?

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:06.860 align:middle line:90%
How do you know that?

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.590 align:middle line:84%
You'd say, well, some scientists
have measured it with radar.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:84%
They can determine the
distance of Venus and the sun

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.209 align:middle line:84%
and thereby extrapolate
the distance from-- but how

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.084 align:middle line:90%
do you know that?

00:04:19.084 --> 00:04:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
they don't know that.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Somebody told them.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So even the most
basic thing that we

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:84%
have every single
day, the sun, we

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.580 align:middle line:84%
don't actually know
personally what it is.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.570 align:middle line:84%
We just have this knowledge
that has been passed to us.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.690 align:middle line:84%
But there's no personal
experiential knowledge of it.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So you know, the professor
would go around the class

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and give examples
of all these things.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.970 align:middle line:90%
What is the moon?

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.200 align:middle line:90%
What happens after you die?

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.750 align:middle line:90%
And nobody knows anything.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So there's just this
established idea

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.540 align:middle line:84%
that most of what we
classify as knowledge

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.090 align:middle line:90%
is in fact just belief.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.040 align:middle line:90%
It's just belief.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, there's
something interesting,

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.260 align:middle line:84%
because as you brought up, the
parapolitical/conspiracy age,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.550 align:middle line:84%
I think that there
was such a deep schism

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.690 align:middle line:90%
in the psyche of humanity.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like to use it as
just a simple example,

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:84%
say you suspect your wife's
cheating on you, right?

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.890 align:middle line:84%
It's just clawing at the back
of your emotions and your mind.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.370 align:middle line:84%
You feel it, but you don't
have the evidence yet.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.400 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you jump on
a piece of what appears

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:90%
to be solid evidence, boom.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.800 align:middle line:84%
You have a whole new philosophy
and belief about what

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.790 align:middle line:90%
happened there.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think the cognitive
dissonance and mass

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.180 align:middle line:84%
of knowing we've been lied
to through so many systems

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.710 align:middle line:84%
for so long, just feeling
split, uncomfortable, not

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:84%
able to really take control
of our will and our thoughts

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.730 align:middle line:84%
properly anymore,
conspiracy came along

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:84%
I think to fill a gap,
which is, OK, here

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.320 align:middle line:90%
are some other ideas about it.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And so people jumped on
that as a belief system

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and without questioning
a lot of stuff,

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.260 align:middle line:84%
because it satisfied
that discomfort

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.632 align:middle line:84%
of the cognitive dissonance
of knowing you're lied to

00:06:03.632 --> 00:06:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and you're off-kilter
but don't know why.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think that panders to
the human impulse and desire

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.800 align:middle line:84%
to want to follow, so I
think it's extremely unusual

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.270 align:middle line:84%
to get self-determining human
beings who want to discriminate

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.800 align:middle line:90%
and make judgments.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.855 align:middle line:84%
You know, these days it's
very unfashionable to judge,

00:06:23.855 --> 00:06:24.655 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:06:24.655 --> 00:06:26.863 align:middle line:84%
You hear a lot of people
saying, oh, I'm not judging.

00:06:26.863 --> 00:06:28.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm not judging.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.970 align:middle line:90%
I have no problem with judging.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:30.890 align:middle line:90%
Judge away.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.590 align:middle line:84%
You have to make a quality call,
basically, say this is rubbish

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.574 align:middle line:90%
and this is excellent.

00:06:35.574 --> 00:06:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle, there's
something that's average,

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:90%
and that's OK.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
sort of judgement

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.250 align:middle line:84%
you can make for yourself,
so most people don't want

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:84%
to self-determine, because
it means they have to become

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.034 align:middle line:84%
their own authority, so they'd
rather have someone else do it.

00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:51.575 align:middle line:84%
And I think when
people do understand

00:06:51.575 --> 00:06:56.060 align:middle line:84%
that the government isn't
really what we thought

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.370 align:middle line:84%
it was when we were children and
the United Nations isn't what

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:84%
we thought it was and a lot
of major wars in Vietnam

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.190 align:middle line:84%
and World War II and
Iraq, they're not

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.660 align:middle line:84%
what we thought they were
and the Federal Reserve

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.350 align:middle line:84%
isn't what we-- and
so on and so on.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that what
we'd invested in our belief

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.320 align:middle line:84%
has been disrespected
and dishonored.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Then you immediately want an
honorable thing to follow.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.127 align:middle line:84%
So the first guy
who comes along--

00:07:24.127 --> 00:07:25.085 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:07:25.085 --> 00:07:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --who has any sort of
half-conviction and who looks

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.140 align:middle line:90%
honorable--

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A shred
of evidence, even.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.495 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --and who has
some information that

00:07:32.495 --> 00:07:34.790 align:middle line:84%
could be considered
as Plato described it

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.480 align:middle line:90%
as justified true belief.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.770 align:middle line:84%
That's knowledge, it doesn't
have to be fact and universally

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.150 align:middle line:84%
applicable, just
a true belief that

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.740 align:middle line:84%
is justified for one's
self, then they follow it.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.370 align:middle line:84%
So a question I get
asked all the time, which

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.910 align:middle line:84%
is why I raised this considering
what to talk to you about

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:84%
today, people say
to me all the time,

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:90%
how do I know who to follow?

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.720 align:middle line:84%
This guy says things and
it's really interesting,

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.440 align:middle line:84%
loads of followers, big
numbers, great stuff, but--

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Intriguing.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It's intriguing.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.040 align:middle line:90%
It's juicy.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:90%
It's salacious sometimes.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:90%
Is that wrong?

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.420 align:middle line:90%
Is that rubbish or is it good?

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, is there
something to learn?

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.610 align:middle line:90%
How can we tell?

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And my answer is, well,
experiential knowledge

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.130 align:middle line:84%
is the only real
primary one, so you

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.160 align:middle line:90%
have to do that for yourself.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.250 align:middle line:84%
But also in the character
of the individual

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and in the sort of
comportment of the individual

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.289 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of clues, so you
can tell things straight away.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:35.730 align:middle line:90%
So I've said this to you--

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't
ignore the clues.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Don't
ignore the clues.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.260 align:middle line:84%
I've said this to
you off-camera,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.929 align:middle line:84%
but I think we're quite safe
to say it on-camera as well.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've followed
people in the past myself,

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:49.090 align:middle line:84%
the work, and read books and
been to conferences and that.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I've gone to
a conference to speak.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.395 align:middle line:90%
And this guy's coming.

00:08:52.395 --> 00:08:53.270 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh, great.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.149 align:middle line:90%
This guy.

00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:90%
I've always wanted to meet him.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:90%
His work is great.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.860 align:middle line:90%
And then I meet him.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And he's-- well,
let's put it politely.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.990 align:middle line:90%
He's not who I thought he was.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.755 align:middle line:84%
And then offstage, you know,
the behavior is different.

00:09:05.755 --> 00:09:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just thinking,
so it's just something

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.154 align:middle line:90%
that you do as a presentation.

00:09:12.154 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's an
idea that sells.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: It's a
version of yourself

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:84%
that you've put forward, but
it's not really integrated.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.190 align:middle line:84%
It's not really
transformed in yourself.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.700 align:middle line:84%
So the point of
experiential knowledge

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.185 align:middle line:84%
is it is transformative,
so a line I sometimes use

00:09:27.185 --> 00:09:31.020 align:middle line:84%
is truth destroys the
world you used to live in.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And when
that happens, people

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.640 align:middle line:84%
are so desperate to
cling on to something new

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:42.000 align:middle line:84%
that they want just our belief
system to replace it with.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.420 align:middle line:84%
So what I often
suggest to people is

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.970 align:middle line:84%
don't be afraid to
just have nothing,

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.594 align:middle line:84%
to just be in this like
void, in this limbo where you

00:09:51.594 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:90%
don't know what anything is.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.560 align:middle line:90%
There's no yes.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.730 align:middle line:84%
There's no no, no
left and right.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not clear what anything is.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And as-- I don't want to quote
old philosophers all the time,

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.220 align:middle line:84%
but I was talking about
this the other day.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Socrates said, until you
accept that you know nothing,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:90%
you can't see truth.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.890 align:middle line:84%
So there is a
fundamental naivety that

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.594 align:middle line:90%
has to be sort of re-embraced.

00:10:13.594 --> 00:10:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And the great Zen
teacher Shunryu Suzuki

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.900 align:middle line:84%
said in the beginner's mind
there are many possibilities,

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and in the expert
mind there are few.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.150 align:middle line:84%
So the beginner's
mind is something

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:84%
we can cultivate,
even as mature adults

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and as people with
lots of knowledge

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:90%
and lots of experiences.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.370 align:middle line:84%
But that willingness
to be flexible and say,

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.120 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't know
what the sun is.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
happened at Sandy Hook

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.380 align:middle line:84%
with apparently
this young man who

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.110 align:middle line:90%
went and killed a lot of kids.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure about that.

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's
something wrong,

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:84%
but I don't need to immediately
pin my colors to anything.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy to just--
it's not a yes.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:56.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not a no.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.972 align:middle line:84%
It's in a neutral file,
with just a big Dr.

00:10:59.972 --> 00:11:01.645 align:middle line:90%
Who question mark on it.

00:11:01.645 --> 00:11:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But people have
so much of their identity

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.870 align:middle line:84%
wrapped up in their beliefs
and their alliances.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And it really seems
to be the challenge.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It is.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Belief is like partially
responsible for formulating

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:22.340 align:middle line:84%
identity, so in most people's
life we all come to the point

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.790 align:middle line:84%
where perhaps we realize
that Santa Claus,

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.790 align:middle line:84%
or an England Father
Christmas we called him--

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that
was a sad day.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: --is like not a thing.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.837 align:middle line:84%
It's an idea and it's
based on a real guy

00:11:35.837 --> 00:11:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and that's based on somebody
and that was actually

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.400 align:middle line:90%
based on Odin of all people.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.450 align:middle line:84%
But there comes a point
where you realize that that

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.820 align:middle line:90%
affects your sense of identity.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.230 align:middle line:84%
So I remember a young man
when I was a kid and he said,

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.260 align:middle line:90%
have you found out yet?

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.385 align:middle line:90%
And I said, found out what?

00:11:51.385 --> 00:11:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there's
no Father Christmas.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.360 align:middle line:90%
And I said no, not yet.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And you know, he was
giving me a heads-up.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I
don't think there is.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.165 align:middle line:84%
He said, you'll have to
make your own mind up,

00:12:00.165 --> 00:12:02.414 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think there is,
because he was only young,

00:12:02.414 --> 00:12:03.900 align:middle line:90%
but he was a year older than me.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought,
well, that's crazy,

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.830 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
whole excitement for me

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:84%
was that this mystical
figure would come down

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.300 align:middle line:84%
the chimney in the
house, magically--

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.952 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --and
put gifts, and how

00:12:15.952 --> 00:12:18.160 align:middle line:84%
he got a bicycle down the
chimney, I always wondered.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.420 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it was a magical
thing, but from that point,

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.170 align:middle line:84%
I think most people then come
to question beliefs, as a child.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, but
there's something built

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.290 align:middle line:90%
in psychologically in that.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And as it's said that
a cynic is simply

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:38.050 align:middle line:84%
a broken-hearted dreamer, that
may start with the revelation

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.820 align:middle line:90%
that Santa Claus is not real.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And people respond to this
information very differently.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Some try to replace it with
something else as magical.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.460 align:middle line:90%
Other people say, that's it.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm not believing
any of it anymore.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.430 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting what happens
psychologically with being,

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:55.600 align:middle line:84%
quote, "deceived" for
the best of intentions

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.450 align:middle line:84%
on these early
childhood stories.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It is.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.884 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was interesting
for me because I found out

00:12:59.884 --> 00:13:04.560 align:middle line:84%
that as I say Santa Claus was
based on this Norse figure who

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.190 align:middle line:84%
was actually very
magical and was

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.760 align:middle line:84%
this great figure
of transformation

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.860 align:middle line:90%
and transmutation.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So as it happened, just
like 10 years later,

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.945 align:middle line:84%
I discovered an even
more magical figure

00:13:16.945 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:90%
who he was based on.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.896 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it never was
disintegrated, you know.

00:13:21.896 --> 00:13:23.810 align:middle line:84%
But I think for a
lot of people, they

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.380 align:middle line:90%
need something to believe in.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.910 align:middle line:90%
They need something to grasp.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we need
that magical quality,

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.680 align:middle line:84%
that metaphysical,
magical quality.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And even the most conservative
sort of Republicans or whatnot

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.820 align:middle line:84%
who maybe go to church and
need a very practical view,

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.760 align:middle line:84%
they still have their
version of that magical thing

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.970 align:middle line:84%
and some sort of
transcendental quality.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think what
I'm putting forward

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:56.740 align:middle line:84%
by examining stuff in the
epistemological sense of what

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.800 align:middle line:84%
is knowledge, how do you
determine what it is, it moves

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.160 align:middle line:84%
you not to just
deconstruct and make it

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.490 align:middle line:84%
all very bland and gray,
but quite the reverse.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.230 align:middle line:84%
It gets you to say, well, this
is quite an exciting thing,

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.200 align:middle line:84%
because nobody really
is sure of anything.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Even things like we
know black holes,

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.390 align:middle line:84%
we don't know that
they're a thing.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Atoms, that's a
theoretical thing.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:90%
We don't know that's a thing.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Electricity, nobody
knows what that is.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.170 align:middle line:84%
We know how it functions,
but we don't know what it is.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So things that are
around us every day

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.620 align:middle line:84%
that most people think are
real things are not actually

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.490 align:middle line:90%
anything other than ideas.

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you push very empirical
materialist scientists on that,

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.410 align:middle line:84%
they'll go, well,
yeah, that's true.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.770 align:middle line:90%
No one's ever seen a black hole.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:84%
We posit them and we
posit an atomic structure,

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.910 align:middle line:90%
but they're not actually things.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.250 align:middle line:90%
It's an idea.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And as I say,
electricity, same thing.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.790 align:middle line:90%
It's like, wow, wait a minute.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.320 align:middle line:84%
So the sun and the moon,
electricity, all these things

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.280 align:middle line:84%
around us, we're not sure
exactly what they are,

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:90%
they're just ideas.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.445 align:middle line:90%
To me, that's very exciting.

00:15:01.445 --> 00:15:01.832 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet we
have an experience

00:15:01.832 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:90%
of each of those things.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.243 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: We have
an experience of it.

00:15:04.243 --> 00:15:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And the experience
I have of the sun

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.750 align:middle line:84%
is rather like my
druidic ancestors

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.880 align:middle line:84%
did like 5,000 years ago, which
is, it's a thing that comes up

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.904 align:middle line:84%
over the horizon, warms me,
and the land and things grow,

00:15:17.904 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:90%
and then it goes down again.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.222 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
transcendental about it

00:15:21.222 --> 00:15:22.680 align:middle line:84%
there's something
special about it.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And in my mystical tradition of
hermetic origin it's a being.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a life force.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And you could be very
broad about that and just

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.230 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, it's the giver
of life and it's source

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:39.530 align:middle line:84%
or it's some sort
of divine oracle.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And you can be a little general
or you can be very specific

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:47.190 align:middle line:84%
and say, no, it's an agency
of the divine right here.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when one
reads this initially

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.550 align:middle line:84%
as a 20-year-old,
you think, well, it's

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.860 align:middle line:84%
figurative, sort of
religious poetry.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.470 align:middle line:84%
But with each passing
year, I've come

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.250 align:middle line:84%
to regard that more
and more literally

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.417 align:middle line:84%
and think maybe it is an
agent of something special.

00:16:02.417 --> 00:16:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm in alignment
with you on that.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.280 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
think about it even

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:12.370 align:middle line:84%
from an experiential and an
inspirational level, just

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:16.792 align:middle line:84%
speaking of the sun, when
someone has a little pocket

00:16:16.792 --> 00:16:18.250 align:middle line:84%
change and wants
to go on vacation,

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.600 align:middle line:84%
they usually want to go
somewhere where they're

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle line:90%
being bathed in the sun.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.350 align:middle line:84%
That's a very common
thing, to bathe in the sun.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:28.270 align:middle line:84%
We idealize and want
to experience sunsets

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:90%
and sunrises.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.990 align:middle line:84%
These are really big parts
of our internal psyche

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.500 align:middle line:84%
that goes far beyond
growing plants.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:84%
There is something
transcendental

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:41.480 align:middle line:84%
as an entity, multi-dimensional
entity itself there.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I mean, I'm with
you on the page of that.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.250 align:middle line:84%
But that's been through
a lot of thinking,

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.950 align:middle line:84%
reflecting, self-experience,
knowledge to come to,

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:50.970 align:middle line:90%
what is the sun?

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's a great question.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And in my work and my written
work and the public seminars

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.820 align:middle line:84%
I do-- and I'm doing
another one in September--

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.319 align:middle line:84%
over and over again we
explore the nature of the sun.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.819 align:middle line:90%
Critical to all life.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --and its properties
both in a material sense

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:84%
but more significantly
in a-- we'll use

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:19.421 align:middle line:84%
the Victorian word,
in an etheric sense

00:17:19.421 --> 00:17:21.150 align:middle line:90%
are extremely important.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And in some of the key texts
that I refer my colleagues

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and clients to, such as the
Corpus Hermeticum, I often--

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:35.480 align:middle line:84%
and maybe also "The
Kybalion" as well,

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.730 align:middle line:84%
this little book by
William Walker Atkinson--

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.670 align:middle line:84%
the sun keeps appearing
in these texts.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And they call it the
Heavenly Father and stuff.

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.809 align:middle line:84%
And they call it,
you know, the child--

00:17:48.809 --> 00:17:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The sun of God.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: The sun of God,
the child of the divine.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And again, initially
you think it's

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:84%
some sort of figurative
thing and you think, oh,

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.030 align:middle line:84%
it's a spillover of Christian
literature or something.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Metaphorical.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: I don't think it is.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.033 align:middle line:84%
I think they're saying,
well, wait a minute.

00:18:04.033 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:84%
It definitely has a
property of a kind of heat

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and it does amazing
electromagnetic radiations

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.730 align:middle line:84%
out that have an effect and
all the wonderful plants

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:90%
photosynthesize and everything.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.260 align:middle line:84%
That's a thing, but
that's a very narrow

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.480 align:middle line:90%
dimensional property of a--

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Material only.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.096 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: There's something
very big going on,

00:18:23.096 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:84%
so what I say to my
clients, basically,

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:31.700 align:middle line:84%
is that you come in through
it and you go out through it,

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.480 align:middle line:84%
so the sun is sort of
like the entry point

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.370 align:middle line:90%
to the physical world.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And you can't get
out until you've

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:43.200 align:middle line:84%
purified yourself enough to
pass back out through it again.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And so it's the story
of Icarus, you know,

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and you're not ready
because your impurities

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.920 align:middle line:84%
make it impossible for
you to pass through.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:56.470 align:middle line:84%
So like an alchemist will purify
a substance in a laboratory

00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.840 align:middle line:84%
or in himself before
transformation, so you have

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.000 align:middle line:90%
to to get out through that.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So when you die, if
you haven't achieved

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.459 align:middle line:84%
a certain level of attainment,
you have to come back--

00:19:06.459 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The path to the moon.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --and continue
refining yourself

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:11.620 align:middle line:84%
and get recycled
through the moon.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So these are
funny, crazy ideas.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Until you can
ultimately, as you say,

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.260 align:middle line:84%
make that transit
through the sun

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:90%
where you have other options.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:19.248 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: That's right.

00:19:19.248 --> 00:19:21.096 align:middle line:84%
Where you can make
some major decisions.

00:19:21.096 --> 00:19:21.462 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hermetic.

00:19:21.462 --> 00:19:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So back to
that epistemology,

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:90%
we'll just round that piece off.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Because just the sun alone,
just what you're saying now,

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.240 align:middle line:84%
that one contemplation,
is that a place

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.030 align:middle line:84%
you would start some
of your students

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:34.180 align:middle line:84%
into examining
the nature of what

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.890 align:middle line:90%
is true and is not for you?

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It is.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:42.270 align:middle line:84%
I would say if you're a
student of spirituality, which

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.680 align:middle line:84%
I imagine much of
your audience is,

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and if you're a student of
Western esoteric traditions

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.850 align:middle line:84%
and magical practices, not
in strictly ceremonial ways,

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:58.340 align:middle line:84%
more in experiential
ways, perhaps,

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:02.510 align:middle line:84%
in one's self and one's own
life path, a study of the sun,

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of a better
test and a better exercise

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.350 align:middle line:90%
for an epistemological study.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.240 align:middle line:90%
What is knowledge?

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.040 align:middle line:90%
How do you know?

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:11.890 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:13.598 align:middle line:84%
So you can literally--
and I've done this

00:20:13.598 --> 00:20:16.800 align:middle line:84%
with people I work with--
set them off for like two

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.990 align:middle line:84%
weeks with a series
of exercises to say,

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.241 align:middle line:84%
create a relationship
with that sun.

00:20:22.241 --> 00:20:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And then in two weeks,
come back and let's

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.440 align:middle line:90%
talk about what happened.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly like
a giant 40, 50, 60

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.820 align:middle line:84%
years of knowledge that
that person had prior

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:36.220 align:middle line:84%
has been reduced to, well,
that was purely-- they call it

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.260 align:middle line:84%
in philosophy a posteriori,
which is knowledge

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.790 align:middle line:84%
sort of after the
fact, and a priori,

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.850 align:middle line:84%
which is knowledge like
say a classic one is

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:50.650 align:middle line:84%
you know all birds have
wings, you might say.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.819 align:middle line:84%
And someone would say,
well, that's true, yeah.

00:20:52.819 --> 00:20:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So I don't need to
see all the birds,

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.010 align:middle line:84%
but I can assume
that might be true.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: You start
to then realized

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.530 align:middle line:84%
what you're taking
as belief and then

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:84%
to distinguish what you're
having as experience, which

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.330 align:middle line:90%
in mysticism is crucial.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So you mustn't
ever dispel anything,

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.150 align:middle line:84%
so whether it's parapolitical
things like 9/11

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and Sandy Hook
and San Bernardino

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.762 align:middle line:84%
recently, which is
very, very, very fishy,

00:21:17.762 --> 00:21:20.442 align:middle line:84%
but you can't go to
YouTube and oh, it's a hoax

00:21:20.442 --> 00:21:21.400 align:middle line:90%
and it's this and that.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.790 align:middle line:90%
Those people are hopeless.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.110 align:middle line:90%
They don't know anything.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And you can't go to
the mainstream news

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and they say, oh, it's these
terrible Islamist people who

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.230 align:middle line:84%
are disgruntled and want
to hurt the Westerners.

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.430 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't seem to be
quite the thing either.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.810 align:middle line:90%
There's something else.

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's no reason
why you can't go and take

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:84%
a look at that as
your own study.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.170 align:middle line:84%
For me, those things
are not as interesting.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.330 align:middle line:84%
What's more interesting
is the elements, the sun,

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:51.640 align:middle line:84%
the moon, the Earth, the sky,
even the shape of the world,

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.780 align:middle line:90%
like very--

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is a
big one right now.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.603 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: This is a
big one right now.

00:21:55.603 --> 00:21:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The flat earth theory.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: The idea that it
isn't necessarily a sphere,

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.200 align:middle line:90%
which it isn't.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.080 align:middle line:84%
It's an oblate
spheroid, for starters.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Like an orange, if
you do that with it,

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.163 align:middle line:90%
that's actually the shape of it.

00:22:06.163 --> 00:22:07.376 align:middle line:90%
So it isn't a sphere anyway.

00:22:07.376 --> 00:22:11.130 align:middle line:84%
But using our experiential
things-- I mean,

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:12.470 align:middle line:90%
I just came here.

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:16.050 align:middle line:84%
We had some weather
yesterday so they went up

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:19.910 align:middle line:84%
to like 42,000 feet,
which is quite high.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:90%
And the horizon is at eye level.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:22.670 align:middle line:90%
It didn't go down.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.090 align:middle line:90%
And it's perfectly flat.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.840 align:middle line:90%
It didn't curve at all.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's an
experiential observation.

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm not drawing any
conclusions from that.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.462 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying.

00:22:32.462 --> 00:22:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're putting your
critical faculties and powers

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.992 align:middle line:90%
of observation to work.

00:22:35.992 --> 00:22:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm just taking a look at it.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Taking a look at it.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: My friend who
is very scientifically

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.340 align:middle line:84%
minded, originally
from Cambridge,

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:48.060 align:middle line:84%
he got a laser measurer
from two lighthouse points

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.720 align:middle line:84%
on a stretch of
coastland and measured

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.400 align:middle line:84%
the surface of the water and
there was no curvature at all.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.200 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.593 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:22:58.593 --> 00:22:59.460 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.400 align:middle line:90%
And he was like, wait a minute.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.936 align:middle line:90%
That can't be.

00:23:02.936 --> 00:23:07.890 align:middle line:84%
So just in our own little
kind of amateur experiential

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:09.760 align:middle line:90%
mappings and experiments--

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.385 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This brings
a lot hot debate,

00:23:11.385 --> 00:23:13.642 align:middle line:84%
by the way, a lot-- a lot
of people are looking at it.

00:23:13.642 --> 00:23:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So you come back
to it and say, well, we'll

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:16.850 align:middle line:90%
use this as an exercise.

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:18.460 align:middle line:90%
We're not saying anything.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.200 align:middle line:84%
What's more interesting to
me than the shape of it,

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.620 align:middle line:84%
because, you know, it would
be a surprise, wouldn't it,

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:84%
if it wasn't round,
it is the idea

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:29.870 align:middle line:90%
of heliocentric and geocentric.

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So heliocentric,
of course, where

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:84%
it goes around the sun, and
geocentric, where everything

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.020 align:middle line:90%
goes around the Earth.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's experience on Earth
is a geocentric experience.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.280 align:middle line:84%
No one experiences a
heliocentric sky, do they?

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.090 align:middle line:90%
We're on Earth.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Things go around us.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
our perspective,

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.200 align:middle line:90%
being on this planet, of course.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Everybody's
experience is geocentric.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.479 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Again, if you go to
the "Corpus Hermeticum," which

00:23:52.479 --> 00:23:55.400 align:middle line:84%
is not the ultimate
text or anything,

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.140 align:middle line:84%
but has more wisdom than any
other text I've ever seen,

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.510 align:middle line:84%
they constantly make
references to the Earth

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:06.570 align:middle line:84%
being at the center and
to a geocentric model,

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:10.750 align:middle line:84%
even when they knew there
were other possibilities.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And again, initially I thought,
well, that's crazy talk.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:19.010 align:middle line:84%
People like Galileo
and Bruno had all kinds

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:23.290 align:middle line:84%
of sticky hands making the
point of it's heliocentric

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:90%
and we're like the third.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.370 align:middle line:84%
There's Mercury,
Venus, Earth, Mars.

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:27.025 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Third
rock from the sun.

00:24:27.025 --> 00:24:27.825 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: All that.

00:24:27.825 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:90%
Third rock from the sun.

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And yet there's an
insistence-- and the wise men

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:37.140 align:middle line:84%
that I studied with when I was
a young man in my 20s said,

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.580 align:middle line:84%
don't throw out the idea
of a geocentric model.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.390 align:middle line:84%
I won't say anymore,
they said to me,

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:43.960 align:middle line:90%
but don't throw that out.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.640 align:middle line:84%
It seems crazy, but
don't throw it out.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Again as an exercise,
I have no idea.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.900 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to do is get
in a balloon, you know,

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.340 align:middle line:84%
a space balloon, and
just go up and up and up

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.581 align:middle line:90%
until I can see the ball.

00:24:56.581 --> 00:24:58.080 align:middle line:84%
That would be-- I'd
love to do that.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:58.310 align:middle line:90%
That would be interesting.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
point is you've

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.634 align:middle line:84%
opened your mind to challenging
the prevailing belief.

00:25:01.634 --> 00:25:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: I don't
mind if somebody

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.100 align:middle line:90%
says, OK, come in my rocket.

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.050 align:middle line:90%
We're going to fly out.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:07.850 align:middle line:90%
You can see it.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a big blue sphere
and come back and be fine.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:10.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:11.500 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And if I came out and it
wasn't that, that's fine.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So when you lead with the
experiential acquisition

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.260 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge, your
agility in not

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:26.886 align:middle line:84%
having to stick to one
theory is greatly improved.

00:25:26.886 --> 00:25:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let
me ask you this.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Then in living anywhere within
the universe or universes,

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.700 align:middle line:84%
on any planet with
whatever culture,

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.720 align:middle line:84%
there are collectively agreed
upon realities which forms

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.990 align:middle line:90%
kind of a baseline of function.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And how does what you're talking
about interface with that?

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
for pure function.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:57.660 align:middle line:84%
So consensus reality
is not as important

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.004 align:middle line:90%
in my mystical method.

00:26:00.004 --> 00:26:01.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
my historical one.

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean what I do now as
my cosmology and my method

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:09.680 align:middle line:84%
and my practice that people
come to me to learn about.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.320 align:middle line:84%
The individual is
supreme, right?

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So there is no
objective consensus reality.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:20.780 align:middle line:84%
All there is these intertwined
subjective reality tunnels

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.120 align:middle line:90%
that intersect.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And at intersection
points there's

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.580 align:middle line:84%
great agreement and great
fidelity and definition.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.750 align:middle line:84%
But there is no one
underlying experience.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.620 align:middle line:84%
There's also the
other aspect which

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.330 align:middle line:84%
comes very heavily
to this, which

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:40.870 align:middle line:84%
is a hermetic axiom, which
is in Hermetism they often

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:44.320 align:middle line:84%
refer to the world as
the all, like everything,

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.890 align:middle line:90%
everythingness.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And the all is described
as mental, of the mind.

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I often will
say it like this.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.190 align:middle line:90%
The world is a thought.

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:55.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not a thing.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:27:01.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a thought, because again in
much theology and epistemology

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:05.280 align:middle line:84%
you'll come across the idea
if the all is everything

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:09.740 align:middle line:84%
and it's infinite, it can't
be added to or divided.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.820 align:middle line:90%
It can't be subtracted.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:11.930 align:middle line:90%
It can't be cut.

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:12.870 align:middle line:90%
It can't be unmade.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:14.070 align:middle line:90%
It can't be diminished.

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.540 align:middle line:84%
So how can a world
be made within that?

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.730 align:middle line:90%
And this isn't the all.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:22.444 align:middle line:84%
This is something else,
because if it was the all,

00:27:22.444 --> 00:27:24.860 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't diminish because
it's always diminishing this.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Everything moves
to its end here.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.520 align:middle line:84%
So there's this fundamental
problem in Hermetism

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.570 align:middle line:84%
which is, OK, so the
world isn't divine,

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:33.710 align:middle line:90%
and yet it's of the divine.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:34.810 align:middle line:90%
How can that be?

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's one solution
to that, which is

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.220 align:middle line:90%
it's a thought of the divine.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not a thing.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a thought.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is a dream
of a divine agency.

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:44.815 align:middle line:90%
And within that--

00:27:44.815 --> 00:27:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A dream/creation.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:46.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:47.711 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Creation, yeah.

00:27:47.711 --> 00:27:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And within that,
everybody's personal thought

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.940 align:middle line:90%
feeds into the nature of this.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:53.815 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:53.815 --> 00:27:58.696 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So the all comes
through humans as conduits

00:27:58.696 --> 00:28:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and is shaped by that
human consciousness.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:07.690 align:middle line:84%
So what you think directly
physically effects what

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:09.530 align:middle line:84%
we think is this
real world, which

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:12.634 align:middle line:84%
is real and persuasive
and reliably here.

00:28:12.634 --> 00:28:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you look in the
mirror in the morning

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and brush your teeth,
it's still that face.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:17.620 align:middle line:90%
It's still me.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm still the same.

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:22.824 align:middle line:84%
So it has great
consistency and coherence.

00:28:22.824 --> 00:28:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's really why
I brought that up, yeah.

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: But it's
just a thought.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So you're
taught, in my method,

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:33.710 align:middle line:84%
that your thoughts directly
shape the nature of this.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:35.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's like hundredth monkey.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:42.240 align:middle line:84%
You only need classically about
140,000-odd people to reformat

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.030 align:middle line:90%
what goes on on this planet.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And we call that
reformatting Earth changes.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a physical
thing like a pole shift.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a consciousness
shift decided

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:55.370 align:middle line:84%
upon by a very small
number of humans.

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:59.480 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, we have
Earth changes, we call them in.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.340 align:middle line:84%
You're bringing to mind my
interview with Tom Campbell,

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.865 align:middle line:90%
my big theory, my big TOE.

00:29:05.865 --> 00:29:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: My big TOE.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My big
Theory of Everything.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:08.840 align:middle line:90%
He was--

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Nice guy.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.680 align:middle line:84%
I had an interview with
him a little while back.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:12.400 align:middle line:90%
He's delightful.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Good guy.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one of the
things-- the way he says it

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.910 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to what
you're saying, which is--

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:21.700 align:middle line:84%
and for people who
don't know Tom,

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.510 align:middle line:84%
he was one of the
original people.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:26.580 align:middle line:84%
He set up Monroe's lab and
he and his partner were doing

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:30.250 align:middle line:84%
the out-of-body connective
experiences they were bringing

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:31.050 align:middle line:90%
back--

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: And he looks great.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.470 align:middle line:90%
He's got this big white beard.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big white bear.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:33.360 align:middle line:90%
I love him.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.443 align:middle line:84%
I have an interview with
him here in the archives,

00:29:35.443 --> 00:29:36.470 align:middle line:90%
so people can watch it.

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:40.050 align:middle line:84%
But he calls it the collective
rendering of reality.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Right.

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very much
like the video process

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:45.430 align:middle line:84%
where you go through stitching
your elements together,

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.230 align:middle line:84%
then you hit the
Render button and then

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:48.480 align:middle line:90%
the whole sequence comes out.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.313 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: In interview
that we did together,

00:29:50.313 --> 00:29:53.580 align:middle line:84%
there was a German
gentleman as the host

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and there was me and Tom as
two guests at the same time.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And almost point for point we
were the same on everything,

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:01.656 align:middle line:90%
coming from different views.

00:30:01.656 --> 00:30:02.052 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:02.052 --> 00:30:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: But we
acknowledged that

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and we were like amusing
ourselves with that.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:09.500 align:middle line:84%
But he has no doubt either--
I shouldn't speak for him.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:14.110 align:middle line:84%
But this is what we would
now call a virtual world,

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.710 align:middle line:84%
that we have that world
now or that word now.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:20.040 align:middle line:84%
My friend Niles, who is making
this movie "Transmutation,"

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.320 align:middle line:84%
which we'll perhaps
mention at some point,

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.640 align:middle line:84%
he has worked in
Hollywood for all his sort

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.740 align:middle line:84%
of adult career
in visual effects,

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.950 align:middle line:84%
doing like "Pireates of
the Caribbean," "Matrix,"

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:33.080 align:middle line:90%
mega, mega movies, "Avatar."

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, you don't
get bigger than that.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:37.150 align:middle line:90%
And he said it's funny.

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:41.260 align:middle line:84%
When they sit down to build
a world on the computers,

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.885 align:middle line:84%
he said, you can't
help but think

00:30:42.885 --> 00:30:44.630 align:middle line:84%
that as it's got
very advanced now

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:47.730 align:middle line:84%
and you can't tell the
difference between this

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and what's on the
screen, he said,

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.570 align:middle line:84%
this shares many properties
with the virtual worlds

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:58.390 align:middle line:84%
that they are making, in that
it's not really as substantial

00:30:58.390 --> 00:30:59.650 align:middle line:90%
as you think it is.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you can understand
that more through movies

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and gaming, very
advanced video games,

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:07.140 align:middle line:90%
than you can with science.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.810 align:middle line:84%
So as he's built
worlds and we've

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:11.360 align:middle line:84%
looked at these like
wire-frame models

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:15.430 align:middle line:84%
before they shade it and light
it and color it, it's a dome.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:19.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a flat plain with a dome
over it, with a sun and a moon

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:20.100 align:middle line:90%
going round like this.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
that's exactly what we see

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.890 align:middle line:90%
from here, exactly the same.

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:27.305 align:middle line:84%
And you would never
know unless you left it

00:31:27.305 --> 00:31:28.990 align:middle line:90%
that that wasn't the case.

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So again it's a
test of knowledge,

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.220 align:middle line:90%
not saying that's it.

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:33.890 align:middle line:90%
It's just a test.

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:35.973 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a test and
exploration and openness

00:31:35.973 --> 00:31:39.310 align:middle line:84%
to be willing to accept
your end observation/result.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
excuse for anybody

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.980 align:middle line:84%
to say, well, there's the
thousands of years of this.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.780 align:middle line:90%
No, there isn't.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.196 align:middle line:84%
You know, we don't
even know that.

00:31:47.196 --> 00:31:48.870 align:middle line:84%
We don't know 1,000
years of anything.

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:51.156 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: That again,
is just a thought.

00:31:51.156 --> 00:31:54.070 align:middle line:84%
All we know is 20 years,
50 years, 100 years.

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.870 align:middle line:90%
That's all we know.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:55.910 align:middle line:90%
We don't know anything.

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to back into
another subject of polarity,

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:08.200 align:middle line:84%
but again through the hermetic
version of the atomic structure

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.490 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And if we're looking at it
from just even the simplest

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:15.190 align:middle line:84%
structure of the atom,
there is no mass.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:17.220 align:middle line:84%
There's virtually no
mass within an atom.

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.430 align:middle line:90%
It's all space.

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:22.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like it equates to
the number of planets

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.470 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system
as to the space.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So if every single atom
that everything in our body

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and around us is created
of is nothing but space,

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:35.000 align:middle line:84%
then there has to be
that collectively agreed

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.240 align:middle line:84%
upon reality in order to
give form to our world,

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.580 align:middle line:90%
or there is no form, right?

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So going from that
into the creation

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:49.180 align:middle line:84%
of that and polarization of
not only our thoughts even

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:53.990 align:middle line:84%
on the most basic atomic level
of-- beyond the atomic level

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:57.050 align:middle line:84%
of spirit and matter,
spirit and matter

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:58.730 align:middle line:84%
starting to create
reality, there

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:02.050 align:middle line:84%
has to be that mind
you're talking about

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:07.100 align:middle line:84%
to drive the creation
and form of everything.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: The doors, it's like
the soft pattern is pumped

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:14.960 align:middle line:84%
through this medium
of consciousness,

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:20.720 align:middle line:84%
which we can transmit and
receive and rebroadcast.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.700 align:middle line:10%
What people don't
realize is that they're

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:29.260 align:middle line:10%
very central as to the specific
texture and nature of what

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:30.830 align:middle line:10%
this turns out to be.

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So I often say-- putting me
conspiratorial hat on one

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.980 align:middle line:84%
for a minute or imperial
hat as I call it,

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.970 align:middle line:84%
I call all that
empire, you know.

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:43.880 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted to change this
world and instead of it being

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:50.460 align:middle line:84%
a fantastic, harmonious,
dynamic, brilliant, sexy, cool,

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:54.140 align:middle line:84%
beautiful place, which
it can be, of course,

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.770 align:middle line:84%
and instead you wanted to be
kind of dark and most people

00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:00.600 align:middle line:84%
are in a sort of factory system
that is no different than

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.420 align:middle line:84%
the sort of 1780s really
today as far as I can see,

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:06.950 align:middle line:84%
and there was lots of
strife and trouble,

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:12.199 align:middle line:84%
all you'd have to do is get
140,000-odd people and convince

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:18.620 align:middle line:84%
them that the world is just
this enormous mechanism which is

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.380 align:middle line:84%
completely outside
of their control,

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:24.800 align:middle line:84%
which they have nothing to do,
and feed them the images of how

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.409 align:middle line:90%
it works and what it looks like,

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:29.380 align:middle line:84%
feed them the sort of
Reagan-Margaret Thatcher

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:34.440 align:middle line:84%
version, or the Bush-Blair
or the Obama-Cameron picture

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and feed them the science,
feed them the chemistry,

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:40.310 align:middle line:84%
feed them the education
and say, this is the world

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:42.510 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing you
can do to change it.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:46.380 align:middle line:84%
A tiny number of people, that's
all it takes to think that.

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.960 align:middle line:84%
As to the rest of them,
back to computer games,

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:56.530 align:middle line:84%
in gaming there's a terminology
NPC, Non-Player Character.

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:59.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you go in an
advanced video game

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:03.665 align:middle line:84%
and walk around in the game and
there's this character Regina,

00:35:03.665 --> 00:35:04.540 align:middle line:90%
that's a real person.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And you're somebody playing
the game in your home

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.280 align:middle line:84%
and that's your avatar,
so you're a real--

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.925 align:middle line:84%
and there's someone over here
that looks just like another,

00:35:11.925 --> 00:35:12.725 align:middle line:90%
but they're

00:35:12.725 --> 00:35:13.525 align:middle line:90%
Not.

00:35:13.525 --> 00:35:17.750 align:middle line:84%
They're just pure
Artificial Intelligence, AI.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:19.460 align:middle line:90%
That's called an NPC.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Not a real person,
not a real thing.

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:26.185 align:middle line:84%
And even just the
other day Marco Rubio,

00:35:26.185 --> 00:35:32.010 align:middle line:84%
the presidential candidate,
repeated a terrible line

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:33.960 align:middle line:90%
about Obama.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.875 align:middle line:84%
And he'd obviously scripted
this little 20-second thing.

00:35:36.875 --> 00:35:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ad nauseam, yeah.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.416 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And Chris Christie,
who's rubbish as well,

00:35:39.416 --> 00:35:41.300 align:middle line:90%
was really hammering it on him.

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And Marco Rubio in the
press, the modern press,

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.660 align:middle line:84%
which is all written
by 35-year-old now,

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:49.950 align:middle line:84%
they called him an
NPC, said Marco Rubio

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.116 align:middle line:90%
is a Non-Player Character.

00:35:51.116 --> 00:35:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would have
that characteristic, yeah.

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: He's just saying
stuff that's pre-programmed.

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.990 align:middle line:90%
Pre-programmed.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes

00:35:55.790 --> 00:36:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So there is also the
idea in my mystical teaching

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.690 align:middle line:84%
that there are many
people walking around who

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:05.640 align:middle line:90%
share that characteristic.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can find this again
in gnostic and hermetic

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:12.000 align:middle line:90%
and Rosicrucian texts.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.180 align:middle line:90%
Not all people are people.

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:15.620 align:middle line:90%
Not people have souls.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Very divisive, inflammatory
thing to say that,

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:18.890 align:middle line:90%
so you have to be--

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now this is
another place people watching

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:22.980 align:middle line:84%
can jump off and start
their own explorations.

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.604 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: You can go take a look
at that, the different classes

00:36:25.604 --> 00:36:30.310 align:middle line:84%
of humans, not by hierarchy,
not by elitism, just by nature.

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:32.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a tiny number of
people who are actually

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:36.300 align:middle line:84%
responsible for making this, not
7 billion, less than 200,000--

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:37.570 align:middle line:90%
That's key.

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:38.528 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: --in my view.

00:36:38.528 --> 00:36:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the number
144,000 is supposedly

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.740 align:middle line:84%
a sacred number within
the system of numerics

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.180 align:middle line:90%
and sacred knowledge, mysticism.

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Now that takes me to the
subject of the Jehovah Witness.

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Only 144,000 will
be saved, right?

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:55.230 align:middle line:84%
I talked to a Jehovah
Witness a few months ago

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:59.580 align:middle line:84%
who was in it for 25 years,
who was a very free thinker,

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:00.450 align:middle line:90%
interestingly.

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:02.350 align:middle line:90%
I had to leave that, obviously.

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:04.790 align:middle line:90%
But I said, what does that mean?

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And they said, it means that
there are 144,000 people seeded

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:16.700 align:middle line:84%
on the planet at any given
time that are there to,

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:23.060 align:middle line:84%
in his words, bring up the level
of consciousness on the planet.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:25.784 align:middle line:84%
They're seeded for their
abilities to do that.

00:37:25.784 --> 00:37:27.950 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's the same
thing you're talking about,

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:31.350 align:middle line:84%
this 140,000 some that are
here to seed us downward.

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:34.180 align:middle line:84%
He'd say, no, they're
here to seed us upward.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.330 align:middle line:90%
What's your take on that?

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So soul
classifications,

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:41.920 align:middle line:84%
there's a kind of
human who has a soul,

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.560 align:middle line:84%
an independent soul that's
had thousands of lives

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and has built this
incredible vessel which

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.720 align:middle line:84%
is like a chronicle
of incredible learning

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.170 align:middle line:90%
through many worlds.

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is an ensouled human,
E-N-S-O-U-L-E-D, ensouled,

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:01.230 align:middle line:90%
i.e., has a soul.

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:03.440 align:middle line:84%
There are group-soul
humans, right,

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.140 align:middle line:84%
where there's no need
for an individual soul,

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.770 align:middle line:84%
because they're
not doing anything.

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:10.270 align:middle line:84%
They're just living,
breathing, going to work,

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.910 align:middle line:84%
having families,
smiling, falling in love,

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:13.710 align:middle line:90%
cooking dinner.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Nothing wrong with that, but
no need for an individual soul.

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.000 align:middle line:90%
They've not built it yet.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.750 align:middle line:84%
So the soul isn't necessarily
as you might say God-given.

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:25.490 align:middle line:84%
It's built, built by the
individual, by their own will.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:27.840 align:middle line:84%
When that hasn't taken
place, there's a group soul,

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.170 align:middle line:84%
so many kind of
anthroposophists who

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:34.210 align:middle line:84%
were studying under
Steiner in the early 1900s

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:36.180 align:middle line:84%
would say animals are
a classic example.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Animals-- most animals
don't need souls.

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Some do, because they
do extraordinary things.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And many dog and cat owners
will think, yes, my dog's one

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.720 align:middle line:90%
of those special animals.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:46.490 align:middle line:90%
I have one.

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah, see.

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:48.070 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:51.170 align:middle line:90%
So anybody can build a soul.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Any thing can build a soul.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:53.960 align:middle line:90%
So there's that.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's individual
souls, group souls,

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and then un-ensouled,
which again, you

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.030 align:middle line:84%
know, you think, oh, that
sounds like it is-- no problem.

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:03.210 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it be kind
of beautiful in a way

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.542 align:middle line:84%
to come in and say, OK,
you've got 100 years.

00:39:08.542 --> 00:39:10.250 align:middle line:84%
You're bullet-proof,
because when you go,

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:12.436 align:middle line:84%
you're going home to
the divine anyway,

00:39:12.436 --> 00:39:13.560 align:middle line:90%
so there's nothing to lose.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:14.990 align:middle line:84%
But you don't need
to do anything.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:17.900 align:middle line:84%
You just come here,
have a wonderful time,

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:22.490 align:middle line:84%
see the beauty, you know,
love people, be together,

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:24.750 align:middle line:84%
travel the world, watch
the red sunset light,

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:27.150 align:middle line:84%
as I did flying in over
the Rockies last night.

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Just exquisite, you know,
unbelievable thing to see.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:33.949 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you see this all
the time, but unbelievable.

00:39:33.949 --> 00:39:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're
dead, that's it.

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:36.500 align:middle line:90%
You're done.

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.220 align:middle line:90%
And then maybe that's all.

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:39.320 align:middle line:90%
Who cares, right?

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So there's these
different classifications.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Only the individual souls
have the responsibility,

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:48.650 align:middle line:90%
self-chosen, to make this.

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing they
have to be careful of

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:54.100 align:middle line:84%
is that they can be
deceived to make something

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:55.430 align:middle line:90%
that they wouldn't wish to.

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: And that's the trick.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And too
easily, sometimes.

00:39:58.620 --> 00:39:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: And that's the trick.

00:39:59.350 --> 00:39:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:01.366 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And we'll go
back to what we started

00:40:01.366 --> 00:40:03.260 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the conversation.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Even if this is just
an exercise in thought,

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:11.080 align:middle line:84%
even if this is all poppycock,
fantasy, it's still a good idea

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:14.180 align:middle line:90%
and that could be the case.

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And it would be rather good
to me if that was the case.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think personally in my
experience, very subjective,

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:27.230 align:middle line:84%
I have lots of personal--
I hesitate to use the word

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:29.710 align:middle line:84%
evidence, you know,
underpinnings--

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Empirical evidence?

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: I don't know.

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Proofs for me that have
satisfied me to think,

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:38.150 align:middle line:90%
I think that is the case.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:40.320 align:middle line:84%
You can't really transmit
them, and I never

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:44.380 align:middle line:84%
care to prove anything or
evidence stuff to people.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So when they say, well,
how can you say that?

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.456 align:middle line:84%
I can say whatever I want and
I'm not-- I don't give a--

00:40:50.456 --> 00:40:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A rat's tail.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.804 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --a rat's tail to
evidence or prove anything.

00:40:54.804 --> 00:40:56.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
why I could never

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.970 align:middle line:90%
be an academic philosopher.

00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:59.547 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:59.547 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: I don't compete.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:01.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't argue.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't debate.

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:05.560 align:middle line:84%
I just say, here's
my worldview and see

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.565 align:middle line:84%
if you find anything
interesting in that,

00:41:07.565 --> 00:41:08.910 align:middle line:90%
and anyway I'm off now.

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm on another little
journey somewhere.

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So for me on my little
journeys, I've definitely seen--

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and I think anybody who hand on
heart would examine this point,

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.430 align:middle line:84%
there's clearly different
kinds of humans.

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:27.319 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me that
that's OK and natural.

00:41:27.319 --> 00:41:28.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not like there's
dead people who

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:32.420 align:middle line:84%
are aliens and walk-ins from
other-- I don't mean that.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean they're all legitimate.

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:34.700 align:middle line:90%
They're all real.

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.740 align:middle line:90%
They're all here.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.695 align:middle line:84%
We all have the same genetics
and biology and that.

00:41:38.695 --> 00:41:41.730 align:middle line:84%
But the continuance
of that life form

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:45.165 align:middle line:84%
is radically different
from one to the next.

00:41:45.165 --> 00:41:46.040 align:middle line:90%
Walk down the street.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.050 align:middle line:90%
You see it every day.

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it would seem.

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:51.370 align:middle line:90%


00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:52.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's a
brave one for people

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:56.420 align:middle line:90%
to undertake in terms of--

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:56.654 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:41:56.654 --> 00:41:56.890 align:middle line:90%
How exciting?

00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --their own
study for what's real.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:41:59.000 align:middle line:90%
God,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:41:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: How exciting.

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Another one,
the sun and the soul force

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.950 align:middle line:84%
of the human species, the
nature of the soul force or not

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:06.880 align:middle line:90%
of the human species.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.400 align:middle line:90%
We have two exercises.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about depolarization.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.800 align:middle line:90%
This is one of the things.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.380 align:middle line:84%
You say what are your
thoughts on-- OK,

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:16.965 align:middle line:84%
it's collapsing
into the polarity

00:42:16.965 --> 00:42:19.360 align:middle line:90%
and to the center point.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.430 align:middle line:84%
So right now we're living
in a highly polarized world

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:23.390 align:middle line:90%
on every level.

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:24.520 align:middle line:90%
Nature is polarized.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.200 align:middle line:90%
The universe is polarized.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Every single atom in
the body is polarized.

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:32.812 align:middle line:84%
So polarization is
natural state of being.

00:42:32.812 --> 00:42:34.270 align:middle line:84%
But you're speaking
about something

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:37.960 align:middle line:84%
distinctly different in
collapsing the poles.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So polarization
is a mystical principle.

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:47.690 align:middle line:84%
There's different ones of
rhythm and gender, mentalism

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:50.130 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of
mind and polarity.

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:52.970 align:middle line:84%
So everything has its pairs
of opposites that contrast,

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:53.770 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Hot and cold, life and death,
hard and soft, whatever.

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And life's
in the balance point.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Right.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:03.250 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that in the
current world iteration,

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:06.435 align:middle line:84%
in the current
world age, polarity

00:43:06.435 --> 00:43:09.390 align:middle line:84%
is one of its chief
characteristic teaching

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:10.976 align:middle line:90%
mechanisms.

00:43:10.976 --> 00:43:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think I might have
even said this to you

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.610 align:middle line:84%
before in this
studio, but you know,

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:18.650 align:middle line:84%
the bad polarizations at
the moment are really bad.

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And the good ones
are really good,

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.020 align:middle line:84%
so there's more incredibly
wonderful things happening now

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.830 align:middle line:84%
I think than there have
been for thousands of years,

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:27.080 align:middle line:90%
and bad things as well.

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So they extend
outwards like this,

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and as they get
more extreme, it's

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:36.400 align:middle line:84%
a sign of an imminent,
well, reconciliation,

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.330 align:middle line:84%
or if you want a more dramatic
word collapse of polarization.

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Another maxim in my method
is that the point of wisdom

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.240 align:middle line:90%
is only ever the center point.

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you know great joy and
great sorrow, only then can you

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:56.440 align:middle line:84%
find the center point, so by
Point A and Point B, then, OK,

00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:00.580 align:middle line:84%
now I can calculate Point
C in the middle, which

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:03.340 align:middle line:84%
is a point now where
I can choose when it's

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:07.210 align:middle line:84%
appropriate to lose
myself, enjoy, and abandon,

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and wonderful wildness, and when
it's time to look at suffering

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:18.440 align:middle line:84%
and to not be afraid to
feel pain and to see what

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.540 align:middle line:90%
is the purpose of sorrow.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And a wise man, a wise woman
must be able to do that.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:29.560 align:middle line:84%
So it means you have to map
the extremes of both polarities

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.460 align:middle line:90%
to find that center point.

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Again, great disadvantage
in the New Age paradigm

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:40.190 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a distinct
tendency in gravitation

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:43.670 align:middle line:84%
to the positive, which is
a disaster, because if you

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:46.970 align:middle line:84%
miss the negative out, you can't
calculate the center point.

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of like,
I don't do negative,

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.620 align:middle line:84%
I always think positive,
everything's wonderful.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.790 align:middle line:84%
People say it's all good
all the time, don't they?

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:55.730 align:middle line:90%
It's all good.

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:56.530 align:middle line:90%
Everything's fine.

00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:58.380 align:middle line:90%
It'll all work out OK.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going with the flow
and it will be what it will be.

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:06.640 align:middle line:84%
This moves somebody only to
one end of the spectrum, which

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.190 align:middle line:90%
ignores the other end.

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So you are always going to
trap yourself in polarity

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:12.840 align:middle line:90%
if you do that.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So in the work
that I do, we have

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:23.600 align:middle line:84%
this phrase, invite pain to tea,
just as you would invite joy

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.980 align:middle line:90%
to dinner or whatever.

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:27.720 align:middle line:84%
You're never afraid to
look at those things.

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.200 align:middle line:90%
So that's in a personal sense.

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.630 align:middle line:84%
In a broader sense,
here's a little bit

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:36.380 align:middle line:84%
of evidence of how
important this principle is.

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.750 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
television-- which

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:41.570 align:middle line:90%
most people are very selective.

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:43.270 align:middle line:84%
To watch a show
like this, they'll

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:44.370 align:middle line:90%
come and watch that show.

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:48.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't think people just sit
down and watch live broadcast

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:50.440 align:middle line:90%
BBC, CNN, so much or whatever.

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:53.450 align:middle line:84%
But if you watch
television or newspapers

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:55.850 align:middle line:84%
and get your things
on your device

00:45:55.850 --> 00:46:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and look at the web pages,
it's compelling all people

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:01.596 align:middle line:90%
to polarize.

00:46:01.596 --> 00:46:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes it is.

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Either to Donald
and Ted or Hillary and Bernie

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:10.530 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, or to
think that the men who

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:13.810 align:middle line:84%
were doing the quote,
"standoff" in Oregon

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:17.510 align:middle line:84%
are stupid preppers or
brave Constitutionalists.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:19.934 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: It's one
or the other, right?

00:46:19.934 --> 00:46:23.030 align:middle line:84%
It's one or the other and
there's no middle ground.

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:24.600 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't exist.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So all the time,
especially in politics,

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.010 align:middle line:84%
the politicization
of everything is

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:35.080 align:middle line:84%
trying to push us to one end
of that spectrum or the other.

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.100 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really
matter which one it is.

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, because it's
really only about the material

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.770 align:middle line:90%
sell point.

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:45.080 align:middle line:84%
You have to have an
extreme polarization

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:47.420 align:middle line:84%
to identify a market to
sell to, which is what

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.990 align:middle line:90%
drives the media to begin with.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: You can't get
more polarized really

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.100 align:middle line:84%
than Donald Trump
and Bernie Sanders

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:56.770 align:middle line:84%
as like a kind of
brash capitalist

00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:58.540 align:middle line:90%
and a kind of geeky Socialist.

00:46:58.540 --> 00:46:59.890 align:middle line:90%
You can't get more polarized.

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:00.691 align:middle line:90%
And yet--

00:47:00.691 --> 00:47:02.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It works
as cover boys.

00:47:02.065 --> 00:47:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Wrong answers, right?

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:06.120 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to help
anybody in this society.

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, decent guys or
whatever, I don't know.

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.744 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if you went
for dinner with them,

00:47:09.744 --> 00:47:12.530 align:middle line:84%
you'd think, you know, actually
nice people, interesting,

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:13.710 align:middle line:90%
not quite what I thought.

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:16.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:19.900 align:middle line:84%
In what they put forward
it's purposefully polarized.

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And the people who are
pushing that agenda, all

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:24.480 align:middle line:84%
they have to do is let
that person come forward,

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.480 align:middle line:84%
because Bernie is going
to try and do it anyway.

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Donald's going to
try and do it anyway.

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:31.150 align:middle line:84%
But people let that happen,
you know, mess with the numbers

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:32.960 align:middle line:90%
to allow them to rise up.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So people get the sense
that America is greatly

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:38.000 align:middle line:90%
polarized at the moment.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.290 align:middle line:84%
We want a return to American
traditional exceptionalism

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:46.020 align:middle line:84%
or this Europeanization
of America.

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:46.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh, dear.

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:47.620 align:middle line:90%
Please, no.

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:49.644 align:middle line:84%
So you don't want
that, trust me.

00:47:49.644 --> 00:47:51.354 align:middle line:90%
But all wrong answers, right?

00:47:51.354 --> 00:47:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All wrong answers.

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:55.132 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So you can't
get to it from that.

00:47:55.132 --> 00:47:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And what it does
again-- and I know

00:47:56.590 --> 00:48:00.690 align:middle line:84%
we discussed this-- is
it totally disempowers

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:02.680 align:middle line:84%
the creation of the world
from the individual,

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.763 align:middle line:84%
because you just think,
well, I can't do anything.

00:48:04.763 --> 00:48:07.520 align:middle line:84%
All I can do is
every four years is

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.470 align:middle line:84%
put a ballot in to
vote for somebody,

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:12.890 align:middle line:84%
or maybe vote locally
every couple of years,

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:15.610 align:middle line:84%
or maybe write to my
senator or something.

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:17.380 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can really do.

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you get caught up
in that politicization of life,

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.950 align:middle line:84%
you're not creating the
world you want to create.

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:26.970 align:middle line:84%
You're creating what
you're told to create.

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So in my method, it's much
more like urgent and material

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:33.740 align:middle line:90%
than you think.

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:38.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not a principle, a sort
of idealist view of what we

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:40.970 align:middle line:90%
could do to create a better--

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:45.080 align:middle line:84%
We create this every single
day we take a breath.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.480 align:middle line:90%
We're making this.

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not sure who
you are and what you're doing,

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:52.930 align:middle line:84%
you end up making what someone
else tells you to make.

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.916 align:middle line:84%
And that polarization
process is designed

00:48:55.916 --> 00:48:57.540 align:middle line:84%
for one thing and
one thing only, which

00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:00.130 align:middle line:84%
is to instruct
human beings to make

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:02.390 align:middle line:84%
a world that someone else
is instructing them to do,

00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:03.190 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:08.820 align:middle line:84%
For gain, for
whichever gain, you

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:10.370 align:middle line:84%
know, whether it's
an energetic gain

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:13.060 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's a material
gain, by those programming

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:13.930 align:middle line:90%
that reality.

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And as you were talking earlier
about becoming lost in pain

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:21.640 align:middle line:84%
or becoming lost in
bliss, it doesn't really

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:23.000 align:middle line:90%
matter which one it is.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a real maturity
and thoughtfulness

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:29.640 align:middle line:84%
that has to take place to
find one's way to the center

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.880 align:middle line:90%
and employ will.

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
will for a moment.

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.610 align:middle line:84%
This is a misunderstood
word and the thing

00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:38.900 align:middle line:84%
that's probably needed more
than anything right now.

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So I'll tell
you just straight off,

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:43.500 align:middle line:90%
will is a divine thing.

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the
creational imperative that

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:52.850 align:middle line:84%
is given to the ensouled human
to say, while you're here,

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:55.710 align:middle line:84%
you can do whatever you wish
with your creational gift.

00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:58.420 align:middle line:84%
You can create a
dreadful dystopia

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:00.150 align:middle line:90%
or a wonderful paradise.

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:02.029 align:middle line:84%
You can laugh and
dance or you can

00:50:02.029 --> 00:50:03.820 align:middle line:84%
sit in the corner over
there and, you know,

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:04.480 align:middle line:90%
slit your wrists.

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.688 align:middle line:90%
You can do whatever you want.

00:50:05.688 --> 00:50:06.980 align:middle line:90%
It's all good.

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:08.600 align:middle line:84%
But you have the
power to create,

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:12.830 align:middle line:90%
so will is a divine ordinance.

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:19.025 align:middle line:84%
And I would say if we want to be
brave in language for a minute,

00:50:19.025 --> 00:50:21.090 align:middle line:90%
it essentially is God's will.

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And I would say
God's a funny word

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:26.510 align:middle line:84%
to use, in that it is
given to you to say here's

00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:27.720 align:middle line:90%
a piece of my will.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:28.520 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And while you've got it, you can
do whatever you want with it.

00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:38.840 align:middle line:84%
That will is responsible
for the shape, the texture,

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.850 align:middle line:84%
the tone, the duration
of this world.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And only people who
choose to exercise it

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:48.690 align:middle line:84%
can actually manifest
anything at all.

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:51.030 align:middle line:84%
It can be de-activated,
that will.

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And its most closely
equated thing

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:57.530 align:middle line:84%
is a sort of loss
of belief or, as you

00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:59.790 align:middle line:84%
say, a kind of
cynicism, where you just

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:01.290 align:middle line:90%
think, well, what's the point?

00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:02.290 align:middle line:90%
Why bother?

00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:02.870 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:04.453 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all have
moments like that,

00:51:04.453 --> 00:51:06.610 align:middle line:84%
but some people go through
decades of why bother?

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:07.660 align:middle line:90%
There's no point.

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:10.929 align:middle line:84%
Everything is so hopelessly
broken, why bother?

00:51:10.929 --> 00:51:12.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's no point
in getting out of bed.

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:14.870 align:middle line:84%
We might as well just play
video games or watch old movies

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:16.220 align:middle line:90%
and eat pizza or whatever.

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're
seeing the effects of that.

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Right.

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So you see that, there's
just giant apathy.

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's like the
deactivation of will.

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:29.630 align:middle line:84%
So will is really like a lovely
bestowal, a sort of endowment

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:32.480 align:middle line:84%
to say, here's a
very beautiful gift

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:37.130 align:middle line:90%
of great power and great love.

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:39.336 align:middle line:90%
And you don't have to use it.

00:51:39.336 --> 00:51:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And be careful you don't
get tricked into using it

00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:42.640 align:middle line:90%
for the wrong thing.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:45.200 align:middle line:84%
But once you have
it, it is the thing

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.710 align:middle line:84%
that allows you to discern
and judge and discriminate

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:52.500 align:middle line:84%
in the most excellent
possible senses.

00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:55.930 align:middle line:84%
It enables you to depolarize
and find that center point.

00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And once you've mapped
both polarizations,

00:51:57.890 --> 00:52:01.670 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to play that game
anymore like good day, bad day,

00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:02.565 align:middle line:90%
good day.

00:52:02.565 --> 00:52:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Oh, totally in love,
totally despondent.

00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:06.630 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't happen anymore.

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:08.310 align:middle line:84%
When you've got the
center point, you

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:11.620 align:middle line:84%
can move with this principle
of rhythm and think,

00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:14.980 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, you know,
melancholy shows us something.

00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:16.470 align:middle line:90%
Loneliness shows you something.

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:17.745 align:middle line:90%
But it's not going to trap me.

00:52:17.745 --> 00:52:19.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to kill
me like it used to do,

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:21.080 align:middle line:90%
because I've been there.

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And now I don't need
to do that anymore.

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:25.765 align:middle line:84%
Once you get that center point
consistent and you can sustain

00:52:25.765 --> 00:52:29.590 align:middle line:84%
it, the whole polarization
collapses and pain

00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:31.400 align:middle line:90%
ceases to be pain anymore.

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.610 align:middle line:90%
Joy ceases to be joy.

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:34.000 align:middle line:90%
It's something else.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.970 align:middle line:90%
You transcend that whole thing.

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:39.580 align:middle line:84%
So you might say there's 12
ultimate polarizations, which

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:41.220 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about
some other time.

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And part of life coming here is
to learn each one and collapse

00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:47.310 align:middle line:90%
m reconcile it for yourself.

00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And when all the people who are
creating this have done that,

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:53.240 align:middle line:90%
you get an Earth change.

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And different
reality entirely.

00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:56.371 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: You get
a big Earth change.

00:52:56.371 --> 00:52:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's this--
now, this is more personal.

00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:03.460 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of a feeling
more than anything within myself

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:10.270 align:middle line:84%
is this reemergence of a desire
to see enacted what you would

00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:14.330 align:middle line:84%
call in the most classical
mythical Arthurian terms

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:16.600 align:middle line:84%
chivalry in its truest
sense of the word.

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:17.400 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like--

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: That's a word
you don't hear very much.

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's something
I'm looking into,

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm studying from ancient and
modern viewpoints right now.

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:27.780 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that
there's something in myself--

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and when I hear other people
speak, especially women,

00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:36.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing this as a
thing that is being craved

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:40.590 align:middle line:84%
on a subconscious level, the
truest, purest version of what

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:41.390 align:middle line:90%
chivalry is.

00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean Sir Walter
Raleigh throwing your coat down

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:45.050 align:middle line:90%
in the mud for a woman.

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:47.587 align:middle line:84%
No, I mean that will,
that standing up

00:53:47.587 --> 00:53:49.420 align:middle line:84%
for what's right and
truthful and putting it

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:50.461 align:middle line:90%
all on the line for that.

00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It is.

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.480 align:middle line:84%
It's honorable conduct,
which is to say

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.790 align:middle line:84%
no when it's unpopular
and yes when it's

00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:58.260 align:middle line:90%
unpopular in equal measure.

00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:00.548 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And to
call it, you know,

00:54:00.548 --> 00:54:06.180 align:middle line:84%
and to like not fall under
the brainwashing of sexism

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:07.710 align:middle line:90%
or racism or this or that.

00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Many of these things, like
I often to say to people

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:13.970 align:middle line:84%
there is no such
thing as equality.

00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:15.050 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:16.150 align:middle line:90%
We don't need it.

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:18.240 align:middle line:84%
There's no equality
in nature, is there?

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.040 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessary.

00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.874 align:middle line:90%
Neither is it here.

00:54:21.874 --> 00:54:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Everything's
completely different.

00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:24.550 align:middle line:90%
There's no need for it.

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:27.307 align:middle line:84%
You might have equity of
potential, but that's--

00:54:27.307 --> 00:54:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
good way to put it.

00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: That's
God-given for everybody.

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And that's
up to you, yourself.

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:35.610 align:middle line:84%
But equality, you can't go
around an establish that.

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So part of honorable
conduct is to call falsehood

00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:40.532 align:middle line:90%
when you see it.

00:54:40.532 --> 00:54:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So if someone says,
well, obviously Neil,

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.520 align:middle line:84%
we're all working towards
more equality in the world,

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:46.030 align:middle line:90%
aren't we, no, I'm not.

00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:46.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm not personally.

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.114 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not.

00:54:48.114 --> 00:54:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And goodness me,
what do you mean?

00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's a level
of personal excellence

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.780 align:middle line:84%
that's embodied in the notion
of chivalry in each of us

00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:58.900 align:middle line:84%
too, which we have let go by
the wayside out of programming

00:54:58.900 --> 00:54:59.700 align:middle line:90%
and laziness.

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:02.260 align:middle line:84%
This takes strength,
fearlessness, maturity,

00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:04.850 align:middle line:84%
all of these things to
employ will properly.

00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:06.450 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And as you say that,
that again uncommon word,

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:13.032 align:middle line:90%
strength, power, courage.

00:55:13.032 --> 00:55:15.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, those are
like rare things

00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:19.190 align:middle line:84%
that are you might even
say unfashionable nowadays.

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:21.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's much more
fashionable to be we can

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:24.112 align:middle line:90%
sort of, oh, I don't know and--

00:55:24.112 --> 00:55:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
we've done enough of it

00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:27.400 align:middle line:90%
and it's not working very well.

00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: It doesn't
work very well, you know.

00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:36.090 align:middle line:84%
To see people of conviction
and experience and maturity

00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:39.960 align:middle line:84%
come forward and
share their vision

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.750 align:middle line:84%
of excellence,
personal excellence,

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:43.209 align:middle line:84%
forget judging it
for other people,

00:55:43.209 --> 00:55:44.250 align:middle line:90%
you can't really do that.

00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:44.376 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:44.376 --> 00:55:45.176 align:middle line:90%
Personal.

00:55:45.176 --> 00:55:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Just for yourself
to say I am going to achieve

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:51.420 align:middle line:84%
a level of quality in
whatever things I'm doing,

00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:58.140 align:middle line:84%
whether it's cooking dinner
or loving my family or writing

00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:01.670 align:middle line:84%
a book or painting
a picture, a canvas,

00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:06.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to achieve a level
of quality that satisfies me

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and really is something that
I can excel in, stand back

00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and think, you know, that
is a fine achievement,

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:17.760 align:middle line:84%
just for me a fine achievement,
and I'm going to strive to keep

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.140 align:middle line:84%
pushing that and pushing it
and having greater levels

00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:24.150 align:middle line:84%
of elegance and effortless
beauty and harmony,

00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:28.070 align:middle line:84%
not like an endeavor like
this, but more like this

00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:32.100 align:middle line:84%
gracefulness-- again a word
you don't hear very much--

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:35.760 align:middle line:84%
that to me is all
tied up in many

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:38.746 align:middle line:84%
of the things we talked
about today with will

00:56:38.746 --> 00:56:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and honorable conduct and
courage, individualism.

00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:43.900 align:middle line:90%
They're natural parts of that.

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:47.860 align:middle line:84%
So again, the empire that
wants to collectivize and say,

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:49.980 align:middle line:84%
look, don't worry about
individual excellence,

00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:52.990 align:middle line:84%
we should all be about the same,
we should all look the same,

00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:55.270 align:middle line:90%
and we should all be largely--

00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:57.755 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think they tried
that in the Soviet Union

00:56:57.755 --> 00:56:58.210 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:56:58.210 --> 00:56:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:02.060 align:middle line:90%
It's just not a human way to be.

00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So individualism and will
for me sort of go hand

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:13.100 align:middle line:84%
in hand, in that you achieve
naturally greater compassion

00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and consideration automatically
with maturing selfhood.

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And so you don't need
to worry about somebody saying,

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:22.920 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm going to take
part of your annual income

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and give it to these--
well, I'll decide that,

00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:27.780 align:middle line:84%
because that will
naturally occur to me.

00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:29.750 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
decide that for me.

00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:31.434 align:middle line:84%
And this guy on
the street corner

00:57:31.434 --> 00:57:33.600 align:middle line:84%
who's asking for your money,
and there's another guy

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:36.800 align:middle line:84%
here, I might look at this guy
and just think, you're a bum.

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.490 align:middle line:90%
You, on the other hand, are not.

00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
like help you out.

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.310 align:middle line:90%
I'll decide that.

00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:44.086 align:middle line:90%
You can't sort of--

00:57:44.086 --> 00:57:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a sovereignty,
a process of being sovereign.

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It is.

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll decide that.

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:50.231 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Everyone else
should decide that.

00:57:50.231 --> 00:57:52.280 align:middle line:84%
You can't have that
prescribed for you.

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what the
collectivization process

00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and empire does,
especially in the sort

00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:00.780 align:middle line:84%
of left-leaning, liberal,
progressive world,

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:04.470 align:middle line:84%
which is supposed to be cleverer
and more forward-thinking.

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:07.170 align:middle line:84%
They're really
deceived by this worse

00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:09.110 align:middle line:84%
than the bloody
right-wingers, you know.

00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:12.670 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to politicize
it, but at each end of it,

00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:18.290 align:middle line:84%
the traditional conservatives,
the modern left-wing liberal

00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Democrats, all that
stuff, both wrong answers.

00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:25.420 align:middle line:84%
You have to totally depoliticize
the whole thing and say,

00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:27.810 align:middle line:90%
that's not a real thing.

00:58:27.810 --> 00:58:29.340 align:middle line:90%
People don't really do that.

00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:31.520 align:middle line:84%
The only people who go
to those polarizations

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:36.150 align:middle line:84%
are people who choose not
to think for themselves.

00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:39.450 align:middle line:84%
In modern mystical
practices I put forward,

00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:43.770 align:middle line:84%
my method and my
examination of this,

00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:47.940 align:middle line:84%
it returns that permission
and that allowance

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:51.320 align:middle line:84%
and that dignity to
make your own decisions

00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:53.740 align:middle line:84%
and to have that
where you can put

00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:56.060 align:middle line:84%
your head on the pillow
at night and think,

00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:59.430 align:middle line:84%
I did the right thing today
in difficult circumstances

00:58:59.430 --> 00:59:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and I feel some organic,
natural pride about that

00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:06.090 align:middle line:90%
in the best sense of the word.

00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And it totally disempowers that
political polarized process

00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and people just switching that
off and tiny numbers of voters

00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:16.660 align:middle line:90%
going out, you know.

00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was a
beautiful explanation.

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And we only have a
minute or so left,

00:59:23.410 --> 00:59:24.950 align:middle line:90%
so is there any final thought?

00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:26.445 align:middle line:84%
There are a few
things that I would

00:59:26.445 --> 00:59:27.653 align:middle line:90%
have liked to have gotten to.

00:59:27.653 --> 00:59:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Is there a final
thought you might have?

00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:35.010 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: I would say that in
the coming months, particularly

00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:38.250 align:middle line:10%
with the political
process in the States,

00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:41.960 align:middle line:10%
which is very fascinating
and worth a look,

00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:47.560 align:middle line:10%
it's a lovely opportunity to
check our own polarizations

00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:50.530 align:middle line:10%
and our instincts to polarize,
sometimes say this is wrong

00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:52.690 align:middle line:10%
and this is right.

00:59:52.690 --> 00:59:54.766 align:middle line:84%
You can only really
do that for yourself.

00:59:54.766 --> 00:59:56.510 align:middle line:84%
You can't have the
screen tell you that.

00:59:56.510 --> 01:00:00.270 align:middle line:84%
You can't have--
you know, I can't

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:05.075 align:middle line:84%
remember these people's names,
Rachel Maddow or Bill O'Reilly

01:00:05.075 --> 01:00:10.035 align:middle line:84%
or Megyn Kelly or all these
crazy left and righters.

01:00:10.035 --> 01:00:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All the analysts.

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: You can't have
those people tell you

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:14.450 align:middle line:90%
the way to do things.

01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:19.560 align:middle line:84%
The only way to do it really is
switch that stuff off, go out,

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:22.720 align:middle line:84%
talk to people, breathe,
watch the sunset,

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.560 align:middle line:84%
make some determinations
for yourself.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Look at your life.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.370 align:middle line:90%
Look at your family.

01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:27.560 align:middle line:90%
Look at what you're doing.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Look-- are you serious about
your own transformation,

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.970 align:middle line:84%
or do you just want to
rearrange the furniture?

01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And in that process of
consistent re-evaluation

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:40.690 align:middle line:84%
of one's self, you
come to the point

01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:44.230 align:middle line:84%
where you cease to buy
into that polarization

01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:46.590 align:middle line:84%
and you start to
collapse it and move on

01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and transcend that
whole paradigm.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.780 align:middle line:90%
And then you're creating this.

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.230 align:middle line:84%
You're not creating what
someone else has dictated.

01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:54.420 align:middle line:90%
You're doing it yourself.

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:55.800 align:middle line:90%
And that changes the world.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.170 align:middle line:90%
That brings the Earth changes.

it's been a total pleasure

01:01:04.379 --> 01:01:06.220 align:middle line:10%

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:08.450 align:middle line:10%
the clarity of his
