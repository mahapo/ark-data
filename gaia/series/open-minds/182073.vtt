>> REGINA MEREDITH: We
have one of our "Open Mind"

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.250 align:middle line:10%
favorites back with us
again, Tiffany Barsotti.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.740 align:middle line:10%
We're going to be talking
about spiritual maturity, which

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.370 align:middle line:10%
there seems to be a dearth
of in today's grand scheme.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.290 align:middle line:84%
But even as I say that, there
are potent forces within us

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.170 align:middle line:84%
that are rising and begging
to take responsibility

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.900 align:middle line:90%
for our deep spiritual growth.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And there's no one better to
address this with than Tiffany.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And Tiffany, first
of all, welcome.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.170 align:middle line:84%
You look absolutely
gorgeous in that green top

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:90%
with your red hair.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.220 align:middle line:90%
It's just so beautiful.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>> TIFFANY BARSOTTI: Thank you.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're going to go,
and we're going to go somewhere

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.570 align:middle line:90%
you haven't been before.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.140 align:middle line:90%
And this is a big deal.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Everybody who has seen you
before in my interviews

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:84%
know the incredible
wisdom and grace and such

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.440 align:middle line:84%
that you possess, but they don't
know what it was born out of.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is not
necessarily an easy story,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's really
time for people to know you,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:84%
because we all know
the things that

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.190 align:middle line:90%
have wounded us personally.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, people
carry shame around who they are,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.190 align:middle line:90%
and how they started in life.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And they feel that
that is the obstacle

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:84%
to their spiritual growth,
but it doesn't have to be.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to start with
your story in South Central

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.230 align:middle line:84%
as a little kid in a very
interesting family dynamic.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.930 align:middle line:90%
So let's just launch in.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Very good.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.840 align:middle line:10%
And to just open the experience
to vulnerability, I think,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:10%
is really just--

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.540 align:middle line:10%
it's purposeful.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.120 align:middle line:90%
It's purposeful for me.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.703 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What made you feel
it was OK now to finally talk

00:01:50.703 --> 00:01:51.620 align:middle line:90%
about your past a bit?

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: You
know, I don't know.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.908 align:middle line:84%
Something just
shifted yesterday.

00:01:54.908 --> 00:01:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Paul and I were
having a conversation

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.890 align:middle line:90%
with Stephen Porges.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And I have been waiting
10 years to have

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.670 align:middle line:90%
a conversation with him.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Or 8 years, really, since
his theory came out.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Tell us about him.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.320 align:middle line:10%
>> BARSOTTI: So Stephen Porges
is the author and the academic

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.120 align:middle line:10%
behind--

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.420 align:middle line:10%
scientist as well-- behind
the polyvagal theory.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.280 align:middle line:10%
And he has a book
published on this.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:10%
And it's about emotions
and the neurobiology

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.740 align:middle line:10%
and the vagus nerve.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.450 align:middle line:10%
So when I was in the midst of
putting my details together

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.110 align:middle line:10%
for my thesis--

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:10%
which we've spoke about
in the first episode.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.420 align:middle line:84%
It's about higher
minds, is that.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.550 align:middle line:84%
The reticular activating
system, the vagus nerve,

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.450 align:middle line:90%
and the Alta Major chakra.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.920 align:middle line:10%
So it was advised
to me to check out

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.590 align:middle line:10%
his theory when I was putting my
details together for my thesis.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And I got into it, and it
was extremely complicated.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was honestly a
little over my head.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.630 align:middle line:84%
But I was like, this
is really important.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.980 align:middle line:90%
And I do need to understand it.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.100 align:middle line:84%
But then another
advisor said, don't you

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.710 align:middle line:84%
dare bring somebody else's
theory into the mix when

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.150 align:middle line:90%
you have enough of your own.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And so complete that first,
and then we can go back.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So I've spent the
years unpacking

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.298 align:middle line:90%
what this theory is about.

00:03:04.298 --> 00:03:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And essentially,
the polyvagal theory

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.960 align:middle line:84%
is that we have a myelinated
and an unmyelinated vagus.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And that we have the ability
to use our vagus as a brake,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:84%
or be able to have
an efficiency.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.613 align:middle line:84%
And it's a reflexive
system in our body.

00:03:18.613 --> 00:03:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you need to
first explain what the vagus is

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.920 align:middle line:84%
so people know what
you're talking about.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to go to
the personal part of the story.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.553 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes, exactly.

00:03:25.553 --> 00:03:26.570 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, yes.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So the vagus nerve
is this wandering--

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.200 align:middle line:84%
it's the 10th cranial
nerve that comes out

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:90%
of the back of the brain stem.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And it wanders to and touches
every single organ in the body.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, it
gives us the signaling.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.300 align:middle line:84%
In the work that
I was focused on,

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.480 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a very spiritual
connection to our vagus.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And some of what we were
speaking about yesterday

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.410 align:middle line:84%
with Stephen Porges
is the reaction

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.170 align:middle line:84%
that our body mind has to
whether we're safe or not.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And what came in as we're
having this conversation

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:84%
is, wow, maybe it is actually
time to go into my story,

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:90%
and where some of this--

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.980 align:middle line:84%
and essentially, what I
was able to teach my body

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.380 align:middle line:90%
mind how to behave differently.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.288 align:middle line:90%
And so me as my own case study.

00:04:14.288 --> 00:04:15.830 align:middle line:84%
What are the blessings
and the curse,

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.244 align:middle line:84%
and the curse and the
blessings of my own life?

00:04:18.244 --> 00:04:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.839 align:middle line:84%
So let's launch
into your own life.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: [CHUCKLES]

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.070 align:middle line:84%
So I was born in Southern
California, essentially.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And my dad, who actually
was a very gifted healer,

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.010 align:middle line:84%
he was studying
botany, and studying--

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.310 align:middle line:84%
essentially, he got a
PhD in pharmacology.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.010 align:middle line:84%
But prior to that, he had
an interest in plants.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.975 align:middle line:90%
And he was very gifted.

00:04:44.975 --> 00:04:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And we lived at USC, at
married student housing at USC.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.620 align:middle line:84%
By the time we
got out of there--

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:90%
I was first-born.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.500 align:middle line:84%
I have a brother who was
about six years younger.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.210 align:middle line:90%
And so he was not born yet.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.730 align:middle line:84%
So within living
at USC, everybody

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.250 align:middle line:84%
that knows where the University
of Southern California is

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:84%
is in the heart of
the hood, really.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And so he we stayed
in that neighborhood

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.580 align:middle line:84%
primarily after he
graduated because he

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.880 align:middle line:84%
got a job in a nearby
hospital as a pharmacologist.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.510 align:middle line:90%
As a pharmacist, rather.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And that was at a time
where pharmacists actually

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:84%
did rounds in the hospitals,
and things like that.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.030 align:middle line:84%
So I actually did a
lot of rounds with him

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.945 align:middle line:84%
and saw really
interesting things--

00:05:27.945 --> 00:05:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When you
were a little girl.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: When
I was little, yes.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And I just found
it all fascinating.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And I remember asking my dad
really key questions, like,

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.350 align:middle line:84%
hey, when-- because I
helped him count pills.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And how does the body actually
know what to do with that drug

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.940 align:middle line:90%
and go in to do that job?

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.300 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody takes
this, how does the body

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.370 align:middle line:84%
know that that's
to stop urination,

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
or to start urination,
or whatever it was for?

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So these were just things
that sort of baked on me.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.417 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you had a
good relationship with him?

00:06:00.417 --> 00:06:02.585 align:middle line:84%
Did he take the time to
explain things to you?

00:06:02.585 --> 00:06:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes, somewhat.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Somewhat.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:05.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.040 align:middle line:90%
He was always a busy mind.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.248 align:middle line:84%
It always seemed as though
he had other things going.

00:06:10.248 --> 00:06:11.207 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Preoccupied.

00:06:11.207 --> 00:06:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Very much.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.260 align:middle line:90%
And I think--

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: ADHD, maybe,
looking back on it?

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: I don't know.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:90%
He's really brilliant.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:84%
So potentially, but I think
his preoccupation was,

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.600 align:middle line:90%
where am I going?

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing?

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.850 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to
become successful?

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.800 align:middle line:90%
And there was a drive to him.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:90%
There's a tenacity.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Very intense.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.202 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
reason as far as

00:06:33.202 --> 00:06:34.910 align:middle line:84%
where he comes from
in that, because he's

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.510 align:middle line:84%
the first-born out of five
boys in his family growing up

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.650 align:middle line:90%
in Chicago.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
Barsotti history as well.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.240 align:middle line:90%

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.517 align:middle line:84%
So can we just back it up
into the Barsotti history?

00:06:47.517 --> 00:06:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sorry, because I
always say "Bar-saw-tee."

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.300 align:middle line:90%
It's "Bar-so-dee," right?

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.637 align:middle line:90%
It's either way, yeah.

00:06:51.637 --> 00:06:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so your
dad was raised in Chicago.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.490 align:middle line:90%
Italian family.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.500 align:middle line:90%
Eldest of five brothers.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.350 align:middle line:84%
What was his deal that gave
him this kind of burning drive

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.710 align:middle line:90%
and tenacity, as you say?

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: So his
father-- my grandfather--

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:84%
had scarlet fever and
was very hard of hearing.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.094 align:middle line:84%
So that was the end result.
So what ended up happening--

00:07:11.094 --> 00:07:12.302 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So they were loud?

00:07:12.302 --> 00:07:13.102 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:07:13.102 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:14.718 align:middle line:90%
Italian-style loud.

00:07:14.718 --> 00:07:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And my grandmother was
Swedish, so we're actually

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Swedish Italian for
the most part, with--

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.270 align:middle line:90%
definitely a mutt.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:10%
But my grandfather worked as
the groundskeeper and governor

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.100 align:middle line:10%
of a very large estate type
of orphanage called Maryville.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.980 align:middle line:10%
And it doesn't exist
anymore, but a lot of stuff

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.480 align:middle line:10%
went down at Maryville.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Such as?

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: So imagine that
the priests of that time,

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and what was happening with
these poor orphaned kids.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:49.940 align:middle line:84%
But what was really
problematic in that design

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.710 align:middle line:84%
is that they already
had, I think, four kids--

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.630 align:middle line:90%
the fifth wasn't born yet--

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:84%
living as a family
on an orphanage.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.050 align:middle line:90%
So they were very much outcasts.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And so my father, being
the first of the family

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:84%
to come up in all of
that, he essentially

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.795 align:middle line:84%
was very much a misfit
within the orphan community--

00:08:11.795 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The culture of
the orphanage, of course.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: The culture--

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.340 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And so he ended up
having to fight his way.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And so everything
became about a fight.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:90%
OK, so here he is.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.420 align:middle line:90%
Now he's grown up.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.240 align:middle line:90%
He's become educated.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.445 align:middle line:90%
He's now a father himself.

00:08:31.445 --> 00:08:32.570 align:middle line:90%
And he's making the rounds.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.559 align:middle line:90%
You're following him.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:90%
You're asking questions.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And he's distracted,
and go ahead.

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
about his personality

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:84%
is, in his tenacity,
that was partially

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.790 align:middle line:84%
because of the
upbringing, obviously,

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:54.410 align:middle line:84%
but his "I need to get to
the next thing, next thing,

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.380 align:middle line:84%
next thing" never made
it feel like there

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.160 align:middle line:84%
was a grounded in the
house or operations.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Long story short, he finished
his schooling at USC.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And he decided that he was
going to travel and study

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.020 align:middle line:90%
the plant, the coca plant.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And him being this person
that blended pharmacology

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and plant medicine
at the time, he

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:84%
was slapped on the
wrist at the hospital

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.410 align:middle line:90%
for doing that sort of thing.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And even though he was
helping people feel better,

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.540 align:middle line:84%
he had this thing
against authority.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So what he decided to do is
take things into his own hands.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And he decided that he was going
to make the-- being a chemist--

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:84%
the best version of
cocaine there was.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This was
obviously on the side.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:47.362 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:09:47.362 --> 00:09:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, was he still operating
as a pharmacist at this time,

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:84%
or had he left that
profession behind?

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.470 align:middle line:84%
I really don't
know that he was--

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:84%
I think he left it, because
he couldn't travel to Bolivia

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.410 align:middle line:90%
and couldn't travel to--

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so he was going
to Bolivia and such regularly.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:04.810 align:middle line:90%
OK, got you.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.500 align:middle line:84%
So now he's taking up a
new iteration of his career

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:90%
as a pharmacist.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.850 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Really as a master chemist.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.060 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't totally understand
all of what was going on

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.020 align:middle line:84%
and the dynamics
that were happening,

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.610 align:middle line:84%
but my intuition was
always very keen.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the confusion
would begin in my own life,

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.270 align:middle line:84%
because I would
know what I would

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.960 align:middle line:84%
feel with these certain people
that would be in our home.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:90%
And they told me--

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:84%
and at this time now,
I have a brother.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And he is, I think, all of
one, or pretty brand new.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And these people would come
around and bring us toys.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And they said that they
were toy store owners,

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and that this was going to be
the way that they actually did

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.980 align:middle line:84%
their imports and managed
the whole back-end

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.610 align:middle line:90%
of the operation, so to speak.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:08.630 align:middle line:84%
I can only surmise
that now in hindsight.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.270 align:middle line:84%
But when they said that
they were toy store owners,

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.030 align:middle line:84%
and they would
bring me toys, first

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.270 align:middle line:84%
of all, what I saw when I saw
these people in our living room

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.560 align:middle line:90%
was not people.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.085 align:middle line:90%
I saw reptiles.

00:11:21.085 --> 00:11:23.780 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:84%
My clairvoyance was that they
had tails, they had scales,

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.935 align:middle line:84%
they had these really
itty-bitty ears.

00:11:28.935 --> 00:11:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Really?

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.530 align:middle line:90%
Even when you were little?

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.390 align:middle line:90%
This is when it first started.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And I would just be
freaked out about what

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.380 align:middle line:90%
it was that I was seeing.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And then also, at that time,
I was having prophetic dreams.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And these prophetic dreams
were always disasters.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:84%
I never understood-- there
was never anything positive.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.620 align:middle line:84%
But they would be in
the paper the next day,

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.540 align:middle line:90%
or on the news, or something.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.470 align:middle line:84%
So I had this fright that I was
causing all of this as well.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:55.597 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:11:55.597 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Because you were dreaming
that you were the cause.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think that I hear
this from other kids,

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:02.870 align:middle line:84%
that they can't
separate themselves

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.700 align:middle line:84%
from the reality
that's out there.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:84%
You think you're really the
cause of everything that's

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:07.610 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.902 align:middle line:84%
This is how we feel responsible
for our parents staying

00:12:09.902 --> 00:12:11.810 align:middle line:90%
together or not, et cetera.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, so these people
are in our living room.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.970 align:middle line:90%
And they're bringing me toys.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just mortified by
what I'm really seeing.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And as they moved
around, I was like, wow.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.700 align:middle line:90%
So I warned my mom and my dad.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.160 align:middle line:84%
I was like, these people are
not who they say they are.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.743 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who
they are, but they're

00:12:29.743 --> 00:12:30.890 align:middle line:90%
not who they say they are.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I became so angry,
just fit to be tied.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.875 align:middle line:84%
And I would destroy any toys
that they would bring us.

00:12:38.875 --> 00:12:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And I really wasn't
a Barbie kid,

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.200 align:middle line:84%
but I became one just
so I could destroy them.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: So I was trying
to get a message across.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because they
wouldn't listen to you.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:48.965 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:12:48.965 --> 00:12:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.718 align:middle line:90%
Your dad didn't listen.

00:12:50.718 --> 00:12:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: No.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And he was so focused
on where it is that he--

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He was going to
be the big drug kingpin with

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.875 align:middle line:90%
the best cocaine on the planet.

00:13:00.875 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: And I wonder how
much of that drive for him--

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.760 align:middle line:84%
it's a question I
need to ask him--

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.860 align:middle line:84%
was really just
for his own safety.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.610 align:middle line:84%
For his own-- of trying to set
up a foundation that he could

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:14.548 align:middle line:90%
be safe and--

00:13:14.548 --> 00:13:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: In control of.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: --and
operational, yes.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.340 align:middle line:90%
What happened with that?

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.240 align:middle line:84%
That didn't go in any good
place, obviously, for him.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: No, not in the end.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So my experience of that
is, cut to a couple years,

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.005 align:middle line:90%
because this was--

00:13:30.005 --> 00:13:32.630 align:middle line:84%
the clairvoyance and all of that
started when I was about five,

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:34.700 align:middle line:84%
five and a half,
something around that.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I had my first
out-of-body experience standing

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:84%
on the porch with my mom
and my brother holding hands

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.027 align:middle line:84%
as the agents had come
to pick my father up.

00:13:47.027 --> 00:13:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The DEA agents.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: The
DEA agents, yes.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Or whoever it was that
came to pick him up.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:58.070 align:middle line:84%
But prior to that, we had
gone through huge issues,

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:02.850 align:middle line:84%
because we were somewhere
where my dad got pulled over.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'm backing up a little bit,
because we got pulled over,

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:07.610 align:middle line:90%
and I was with my dad.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And he just doesn't deal
with authority well.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And so he decided that he
was going to have a fit.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And so somehow--
this is a little bit

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.870 align:middle line:84%
of a blank in my
memory, but my mom

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.970 align:middle line:84%
has filled me in
on some of this.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.550 align:middle line:84%
That what ended up
happening later--

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:84%
because he was actually taken
to jail for a little bit

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.940 align:middle line:90%
from what he did.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.210 align:middle line:90%
And then he came--

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.940 align:middle line:84%
when he was back home,
somehow, our house

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.950 align:middle line:90%
ended up being searched.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:90%
And my brother was in one room.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.240 align:middle line:90%
I was in another room.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And my mom was being handcuffed
and thrown into a chair.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember
being stunned

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:84%
in this whole situation,
and her launching for me

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:84%
as they're grabbing
me and telling me

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.150 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
go to a foster home,

00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and that we needed to
cooperate, and to sit still,

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.210 align:middle line:90%
stop being loud and screaming.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.217 align:middle line:90%
It was high drama.

00:15:06.217 --> 00:15:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: High drama.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: And we were the
only white family in this

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:11.690 align:middle line:90%
neighborhood.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:90%
So this was--

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:15.635 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: It was already--

00:15:15.635 --> 00:15:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You were noticeable.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.660 align:middle line:84%
We already stuck out, so
now it's even more so.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And you want to be
a kid that fits in.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And a funny thing on
that is, I remember

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.310 align:middle line:84%
coming to my mom saying,
hey, why are there

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:32.540 align:middle line:90%
black and white people?

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Did God run out
of black material?

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:36.170 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:39.935 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: So
because predominantly--

00:15:39.935 --> 00:15:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Everyone was black
except you so you must have

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.340 align:middle line:90%
been missing some pigment.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.010 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've got red
hair, and freckles,

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:84%
and really, this
is such a misfit.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so this
whole thing, what

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.070 align:middle line:84%
ended up happening from
that is that, obviously,

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.370 align:middle line:84%
we were on the radar,
and things became--

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.190 align:middle line:90%
he went away to jail.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And my first
out-of-body experience

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.060 align:middle line:84%
was standing on the
porch and watching.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I floated up off of the
porch and over the car

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:84%
and watched how they
handled his head

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:90%
and pushed him into the car.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was just weirdly orienting
myself to float and pay

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:19.550 align:middle line:90%
attention.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.720 align:middle line:90%
This was my dad.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.890 align:middle line:90%
He meant everything to me.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.620 align:middle line:90%
So there was this--

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.140 align:middle line:84%
there's something so
comically important

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.410 align:middle line:90%
between fathers and daughters.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: And
we can't undo that.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.100 align:middle line:84%
No matter whether it's a
tumultuous relationship,

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.685 align:middle line:84%
or if it's something that
is just with ease and flow.

00:16:37.685 --> 00:16:39.065 align:middle line:90%
It's very karmic.

00:16:39.065 --> 00:16:43.245 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So ultimately,
you're no longer feeling safe.

00:16:43.245 --> 00:16:44.045 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: No.

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:44.845 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:16:44.845 --> 00:16:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this
began your journey.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And all the time,
while we're in school,

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:84%
and I'm in third
grade at the time,

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.832 align:middle line:84%
or just going from
second into third grade.

00:16:57.832 --> 00:16:59.040 align:middle line:90%
And what was so interesting--

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.915 align:middle line:84%
I was actually in private
school at the time,

00:17:00.915 --> 00:17:03.890 align:middle line:84%
but then I ended up having
to go to public school.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:08.119 align:middle line:84%
Bill Cosby's brother was one
of our teachers at this school.

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And so strangely,
for some reason,

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:15.740 align:middle line:84%
we were on the topic one day
of studying this area called

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:90%
Terminal Island.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.760 align:middle line:90%
This is in San Pedro.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And my blood ran cold as soon as
he brought this up as a topic.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, how on
Earth is this a topic?

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Why are we studying,
essentially a fishing port,

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:84%
but there's a maximum
prison security there.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where
we went every weekend

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.430 align:middle line:90%
to visit my father.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So I walked up to him, and I was
like, I can't be in this room

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.450 align:middle line:84%
if this is going to be
the topic, because that's

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.950 align:middle line:90%
where my dad is.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And so nobody in
the school knew.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how that was,
but nobody in the school knew.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a pivotal time
of actually starting to say,

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.640 align:middle line:90%
hey, this is real.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel safe learning.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling like I have
to constantly look over

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:00.740 align:middle line:90%
my shoulder.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel safe reading.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.540 align:middle line:84%
It really thwarted my
ability as a student as well

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.453 align:middle line:84%
to be present,
because it was, when's

00:18:08.453 --> 00:18:09.620 align:middle line:90%
the next shoe going to drop?

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So how did this now start
translating into your journey

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:84%
and into the work
you're doing now?

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously, when
you're feeling unsafe,

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.610 align:middle line:84%
you have to find ways
to contend with life.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:84%
You had all these
intuitive abilities

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.410 align:middle line:84%
that worked across all
intuitive platforms.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:28.800 align:middle line:90%
Clairaudient, clairvisual--

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.400 align:middle line:90%
Clairsentient.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Clairsentient.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:90%
All of that.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:34.145 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: That's the--
there is a blessing in a curse

00:18:34.145 --> 00:18:36.270 align:middle line:84%
and a curse in the
blessing, is what I say.

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And what I now know in putting
things into perspective

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:45.990 align:middle line:84%
is looking for what the
blessing was of all of this.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And I had to do a lot of this
work in hindsight, of course.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:52.010 align:middle line:90%


00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.920 align:middle line:84%
The gift of intuition,
we all have it.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:84%
To the degree of the
contrasting situations

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.170 align:middle line:84%
that we need to be in in our
life that actually pull it out

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:03.135 align:middle line:84%
of us, this was
apparently mine, so.

00:19:03.135 --> 00:19:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's interesting,
because most of the people I

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:09.590 align:middle line:84%
know who are noted as
psychics and make their living

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:14.210 align:middle line:84%
successfully as psychics have
had some pretty severe trauma

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:15.380 align:middle line:90%
in their early lives.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.085 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to think if there
are many exceptions to that.

00:19:19.085 --> 00:19:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And I personally
don't know anyone

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:26.555 align:middle line:84%
who is profoundly psychic who
just had an idyllic childhood.

00:19:26.555 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: It's true.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this idea about
idyllic childhood--

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:35.240 align:middle line:84%
and for those of us that have
had these profound gifts just

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:84%
given to us, making sense out of
what the environment was like.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Why were we given these gifts
and in such profound ways?

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:49.070 align:middle line:90%
What do we do with them?

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And why did we have to come out
of such contrasting situations

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.198 align:middle line:90%
in order to create that?

00:19:54.198 --> 00:19:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I would
argue it slightly differently.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: OK.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I would say you
weren't given anything.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.400 align:middle line:90%
That you came in with these.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:06.260 align:middle line:84%
These are talents, skills that
had been most likely already

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.560 align:middle line:84%
present in previous
times and incarnations

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.820 align:middle line:90%
that you came in with.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:84%
But why is that a person has
to be traumatized and almost

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:18.110 align:middle line:84%
separated out from the herd
in order to really start

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.820 align:middle line:90%
implementing these skill sets?

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: It's true.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:22.433 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:22.433 --> 00:20:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: I do find that.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.630 align:middle line:84%
The why, I don't
fully understand.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:30.130 align:middle line:84%
But I do know-- and this herd
mentality is very important

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:84%
to also understand, because if
we're going to effect a change,

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:36.207 align:middle line:84%
whether it be in our life
before it can be in anybody

00:20:36.207 --> 00:20:38.540 align:middle line:84%
else's, because we certainly
need to be on the operating

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:43.670 align:middle line:84%
table first, that these kinds
of things really demand--

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:44.940 align:middle line:90%
these kinds of events.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.370 align:middle line:84%
What I had to live through
and what many others

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.570 align:middle line:90%
have had to live through--

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.970 align:middle line:84%
they demand a different
kind of attentiveness

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.390 align:middle line:84%
to the energies that are really
coursing through our blood,

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:57.080 align:middle line:84%
coursing through our bones
that need to be directed.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And left undirected--
there's another part.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:03.580 align:middle line:84%
In my anger as a kid,
I could move objects.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And I could only do
it when I was angry.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
kinetic energy in anger.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: And
stuff would go flying.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And my mom-- there would be
music that she'd be playing,

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, I really don't
want to hear that right now.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And the record
player, the needle

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.230 align:middle line:84%
would lift off the record,
return back, and go back.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And she was like, Tiffany,
did you just do that?

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.210 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:90%
I guess I did.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't want
to hear that right now.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.510 align:middle line:90%
So there were very--

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:36.810 align:middle line:90%
that kind of energy.

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.660 align:middle line:90%
But what I later learned--

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:84%
because it actually
took friends of mine

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:45.060 align:middle line:84%
that came and said to me,
Tiffany, you are so angry.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
wow, you're right.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.780 align:middle line:84%
I need to channel this,
because that's just energy.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.880 align:middle line:84%
It just needs to be
channeled somewhere.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.920 align:middle line:84%
I ended up becoming a
tournament kickboxer.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Perfect!

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't surprise me.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:21:59.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:02.480 align:middle line:84%
So from kickboxing, how
did you translate this

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.850 align:middle line:84%
into this beautiful
work you do now?

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: So
harnessing energy, right?

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.240 align:middle line:84%
It's learning how
to harness energy.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Either I was going to
be the victim to it,

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:12.110 align:middle line:84%
or I was actually going to
start to learn to direct it.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.902 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing
better than martial arts

00:22:13.902 --> 00:22:15.260 align:middle line:90%
to start to do this.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And so that directive--
and actually,

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:20.767 align:middle line:84%
it came out of-- when
I was early teens,

00:22:20.767 --> 00:22:22.350 align:middle line:84%
I had a person that
said, Tiffany, you

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.750 align:middle line:90%
would do well with a hobby.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had horses, thank God,
because the upside and downside

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:31.078 align:middle line:84%
of being the daughter that is
related to a drug dealer is

00:22:31.078 --> 00:22:32.870 align:middle line:84%
that there was money
and then there wasn't.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And then there was money,
and then there wasn't.

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:35.013 align:middle line:90%
So when he got--

00:22:35.013 --> 00:22:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I assume the money
stopped flowing while he was

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.775 align:middle line:90%
in prison.

00:22:37.775 --> 00:22:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah, but he was
only in for-- so the story gets

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.603 align:middle line:90%
more interesting because--

00:22:41.603 --> 00:22:42.403 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:22:42.403 --> 00:22:44.447 align:middle line:84%
Catch us up on this
because you have us hooked.

00:22:44.447 --> 00:22:46.280 align:middle line:84%
You have us on the drug
now of storytelling.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.090 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: So he did--

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it was about
three and a half years.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So he was moved out
of Terminal Island,

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.450 align:middle line:90%
which was a maximum security.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And a funny thing is that my mom
was always very metaphysical.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.840 align:middle line:84%
She was actually
Rosicrucian, and so I

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.300 align:middle line:84%
grew up with these Egyptian
books, and all of these things

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:05.450 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How was she
contending with her

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.240 align:middle line:90%
husband's new profession?

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.387 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Ugh.

00:23:09.387 --> 00:23:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Not well.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: No.

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:12.900 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe you're
going to throw away

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.780 align:middle line:90%
your whole education.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.240 align:middle line:84%
When he got his
PhD, they gave her

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.210 align:middle line:84%
a PhT, which stands for "put
husband through," because she

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:84%
worked on the
campus, and so yeah.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.305 align:middle line:84%
So all of that was sort
of, I can't believe

00:23:26.305 --> 00:23:28.513 align:middle line:84%
you're throwing your whole
education away, everything

00:23:28.513 --> 00:23:28.780 align:middle line:90%
that we've worked so hard--

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.995 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And putting
the family in danger.

00:23:29.995 --> 00:23:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes, exactly.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.830 align:middle line:90%
And what are you doing?

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:37.040 align:middle line:84%
But there is no reasoning
with someone like my father.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.690 align:middle line:90%
So he just had this tenacity.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: She stayed with him?

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: And when he got
home from the three and a half

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:47.495 align:middle line:84%
years, because he ended
up going to Lompoc,

00:23:47.495 --> 00:23:48.620 align:middle line:90%
which was minimum security.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:49.690 align:middle line:90%
Minimum security.

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, outside Santa Barbara.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And he ended up being
the librarian there.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.690 align:middle line:84%
So he did a lot of
study on tax code.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:01.880 align:middle line:84%
He did a lot of study on,
how do I do what I do better?

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And he had some key
people in prison

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.580 align:middle line:84%
with him that helped
teach him those ropes.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:10.370 align:middle line:84%
So what ended up happening
is that he came--

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.380 align:middle line:84%
I think even while
he was there, he

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.810 align:middle line:84%
was you know
wheeling and dealing.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And so when he came home, he
just did it bigger and better,

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:21.050 align:middle line:84%
because now he had more
skills, more contacts--

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And he
knew the tax code.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: And he
knew-- yeah, he knew--

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Knew how to
move money kind of legally

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:26.430 align:middle line:90%
on the surface.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:30.270 align:middle line:90%
And so he was able to do it.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:90%
And it was before all these--

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.690 align:middle line:84%
it was the Reagan-Bush era
before they went into office

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and used him as part
of a precedent as well.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.082 align:middle line:84%
So long story short,
he ended up becoming

00:24:42.082 --> 00:24:43.040 align:middle line:90%
much bigger and better.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.000 align:middle line:90%
I got horses.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:84%
There was racing
cars in that time.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.930 align:middle line:84%
There's this-- but money was
up, down, up, down, really

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:52.100 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.220 align:middle line:10%
But there were lots of really
fun experiences in all of that

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:56.030 align:middle line:10%
as well.

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you
had your horses.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.900 align:middle line:84%
I had my horses, which really
were a saving grace for me.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.790 align:middle line:84%
I didn't talk to anybody
about what was happening.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.320 align:middle line:90%
This was just all--

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.072 align:middle line:90%
nobody knew.

00:25:08.072 --> 00:25:09.530 align:middle line:84%
I think my trainer--
in hindsight--

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:13.332 align:middle line:84%
had made a comment to me like,
I knew your dad was different,

00:25:13.332 --> 00:25:15.290 align:middle line:84%
after he had gone to
jail, because he went back

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.973 align:middle line:90%
to jail the second time.

00:25:16.973 --> 00:25:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So I knew your dad was different
because he always paid in cash.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.440 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.911 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: There's your sign.

00:25:21.911 --> 00:25:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Nobody did that.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: For a $100,000
horse, or whatever.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:26.280 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm just--

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, I didn't have
those, but yeah.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Which now they do
cost that and more.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:33.740 align:middle line:90%
So I was very fortunate.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.950 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing
was is this independence

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:38.030 align:middle line:90%
which you and I have in common.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:40.540 align:middle line:84%
That, honestly, my
family didn't even

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.270 align:middle line:84%
know where I was, because I
got on the horse show circuit,

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.610 align:middle line:84%
and my mom had her
own ups and downs

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.920 align:middle line:84%
with things that she
was dealing with.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.510 align:middle line:84%
To answer your
question before, they

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:53.400 align:middle line:84%
got a divorce when he came
back from jail the first time.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So I was about 10 and a half
when they got a divorce.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:00.040 align:middle line:90%
Then, she had met people--

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.130 align:middle line:84%
that anger in my
earlier childhood,

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:07.330 align:middle line:84%
she always seemed to have
these boy friends around.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:11.193 align:middle line:84%
Whether they were actually
friends or not friends

00:26:11.193 --> 00:26:12.110 align:middle line:90%
doesn't really matter.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:16.100 align:middle line:84%
But the point is
that these are people

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.580 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want in my circle.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And my whole goal became
about protecting my brother.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.460 align:middle line:84%
How was I going to
keep us both safe?

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And we were kind
of latchkey kids.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.317 align:middle line:84%
There were people
that took care of us

00:26:29.317 --> 00:26:31.150 align:middle line:84%
a little bit when we'd
get home from school,

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:32.040 align:middle line:90%
or things like that.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.960 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part, we
were really on our own.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And these people would come over
before my mom would get home

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.460 align:middle line:90%
from work.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And they would knock on the door
and say, hey, can I come in?

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.292 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, absolutely not.

00:26:44.292 --> 00:26:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Go wait in your car
and sit out in front.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.200 align:middle line:84%
You're going to wait
until my mother gets home.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's kind of creepy
that they would try to come

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:50.428 align:middle line:84%
in before your mom
was home anyway.

00:26:50.428 --> 00:26:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: There were
so many risk factors in--

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm really lucky.

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
anger also protected me,

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:01.120 align:middle line:84%
because people also knew
don't mess with me because I

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.070 align:middle line:90%
would throw stuff with my mind.

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And anybody that was
around in the house--

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Carrie.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:07.722 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly!

00:27:07.722 --> 00:27:08.090 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:10.240 align:middle line:84%
It was like, the only thing
I didn't start was a fire,

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.040 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.100 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so that was
part of that backstory.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So that really set me up
as having this strength.

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was not going
to be screwed with.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And so that independence carried
over when I got into horses.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And my mom was having
more of a difficult time.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.443 align:middle line:84%
She was not really
having her-- she

00:27:32.443 --> 00:27:34.360 align:middle line:84%
couldn't find her own
voice and her own power,

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.090 align:middle line:84%
which is also why she really
couldn't stand up to my dad.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.560 align:middle line:90%
So that came later for her.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.360 align:middle line:90%
And thank God she's got it now.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:84%
So the thing that was pivotal in
that time for me making changes

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.140 align:middle line:84%
is, I'm going to do
what is best for me.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And I can't pay attention to
what these adults are doing.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.620 align:middle line:90%
And the horses are saving me.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to go
to the horse shows,

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to do the best I
can, and continue to show up.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And those experiences--
because there was so much

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.460 align:middle line:90%
that I was carrying inside.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.460 align:middle line:84%
That independence-- I remember
my grandparents showing up

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:13.777 align:middle line:90%
to one of my horse shows.

00:28:13.777 --> 00:28:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't told
anybody where I was.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And then, like,
how'd you get here?

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.617 align:middle line:84%
I didn't tell
anybody where I was.

00:28:18.617 --> 00:28:19.700 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of mortifying.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.580 align:middle line:84%
I think back, like, oh,
that was a terrible thing

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.747 align:middle line:90%
to say to your grandparents.

00:28:22.747 --> 00:28:25.750 align:middle line:90%
But I was really just on my own.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And my brother was to an extent
that he could handle himself.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:31.856 align:middle line:90%
OK, so now going forward.

00:28:31.856 --> 00:28:32.656 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:32.656 --> 00:28:33.456 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:33.456 --> 00:28:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: So my dad
ended up going back to jail.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:84%
I think I was about 18, 19
when he went back to jail.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.420 align:middle line:84%
This time, he was
sentenced for 25 years.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And he was being used as a
precedent, because here he was,

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:48.100 align:middle line:90%
this--

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.192 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: "Just say no" era?

00:28:50.192 --> 00:28:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yep.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.453 align:middle line:90%
And he was a doctor--

00:28:54.453 --> 00:28:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which
was a total joke,

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:58.203 align:middle line:84%
when people start peeling
the layers back of what

00:28:58.203 --> 00:29:00.370 align:middle line:84%
the government and the
intelligence communities were

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.343 align:middle line:90%
doing in the drug industry.

00:29:02.343 --> 00:29:04.510 align:middle line:84%
It's really creepy when you
look at the whole story.

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:05.885 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless,
you have to have

00:29:05.885 --> 00:29:09.180 align:middle line:84%
poster children to make the
regular people stay in line.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And your dad was a poster
child, it sounds like.

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:12.990 align:middle line:90%
He was.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And also, there's stories
around who his partners were

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.650 align:middle line:84%
in that time that I
can't say definitively,

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:22.390 align:middle line:84%
but they were involved
in the government.

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Of course.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I have known about those
stories for many years.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.360 align:middle line:90%
And this was not--

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.680 align:middle line:90%
it's not hearsay.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.380 align:middle line:84%
I just happened to run
across this person who was

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.270 align:middle line:90%
the boyfriend of a friend who--

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:36.220 align:middle line:84%
so I probably shouldn't
be talking about this,

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:40.510 align:middle line:84%
but he was making runs,
drug runs for the CIA,

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:43.580 align:middle line:84%
and flying in from Mexico across
the border, and doing his drops

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:44.380 align:middle line:90%
and such.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.490 align:middle line:90%
He said it's great money.

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: He probably
worked for my dad.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.738 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: He may have.

00:29:47.738 --> 00:29:48.910 align:middle line:90%
He may have.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So that was many m-- that
was 30, 35 years ago,

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.870 align:middle line:84%
before I understood anything
about conspiracy theories

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:54.670 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:55.375 align:middle line:90%
It's not a theory.

00:29:55.375 --> 00:29:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: No.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is what they
do to get black ops money.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: That's right.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.580 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.100 align:middle line:90%
So it's very real.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.040 align:middle line:90%
That is very real.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.640 align:middle line:10%
And some of those people--

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.960 align:middle line:10%
the people that would
be then around us

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.220 align:middle line:10%
again were very scary people.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So I remember
coming home one day.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.780 align:middle line:84%
I had just come
home from school,

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and we were living in
Palos Verdes at the time.

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And I go down into my
bedroom, and somebody

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.740 align:middle line:84%
walks through the sliding glass
door that was to my bedroom

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.360 align:middle line:90%
to the backyard.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of
these Colombian men.

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.230 align:middle line:90%
Nobody else is home.

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:36.763 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, where's--

00:30:36.763 --> 00:30:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you could
see their energies and such

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:39.730 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Some of that had turned
down because I really

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:44.790 align:middle line:90%
willed a lot of that away.

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I really did not want to be
bombarded with as much energy

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.100 align:middle line:90%
as I was in that regard.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.410 align:middle line:90%
So some of that had turned down.

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:57.830 align:middle line:84%
But just the ominent presence
that this person had that was--

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:00.760 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh,
this could go badly.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.240 align:middle line:90%
But I triangulated.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even remember how
I got out of that situation,

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.020 align:middle line:84%
but nothing horrible
happened to me then.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's good, because
you were a pretty girl.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:12.520 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.853 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, you never know.

00:31:13.853 --> 00:31:15.968 align:middle line:90%
So you were protected also.

00:31:15.968 --> 00:31:17.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as though
you were truly alone.

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.093 align:middle line:90%
You just thought you were alone.

00:31:19.093 --> 00:31:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.630 align:middle line:84%
I definitely have
felt protected.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So now we start moving into
how this started translating.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And we may or may
not, in today's story,

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.480 align:middle line:84%
even get to a lot of what we
were going to-- our research

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and everything, a lot
of the points that--

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: I know, because
we had a different plan.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:37.883 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We had a
different plan entirely.

00:31:37.883 --> 00:31:40.770 align:middle line:84%
But honestly, I think this
story itself is very important.

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to
share the vulnerabilities

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.720 align:middle line:84%
and the motivations
that create people

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.390 align:middle line:84%
who dedicate their life
to healing practices,

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.880 align:middle line:84%
because there always is
some deeper motivation.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to
continue on that.

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So now you started
harnessing the anger.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.080 align:middle line:84%
You've been through
the horse shows.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.390 align:middle line:90%
You've been through kickboxing.

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:02.500 align:middle line:90%
Now you're starting to--

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.140 align:middle line:84%
you're dialing down
the ability to see

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:07.080 align:middle line:84%
into the darker
aspects of reality that

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.330 align:middle line:90%
exist just slightly phased off.

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:10.130 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:11.790 align:middle line:84%
You managed to get
through because you

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:15.090 align:middle line:84%
had all this protection
without being seriously harmed

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.980 align:middle line:84%
on a personal level,
which is wonderful.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.790 align:middle line:84%
But your life was
set up so that--

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:21.690 align:middle line:84%
we were joking about
this in the green room--

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:23.970 align:middle line:84%
you could have just as
easily been on the street--

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:25.137 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Turning tricks.

00:32:25.137 --> 00:32:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --turning tricks,
and you ended up the exact

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.720 align:middle line:90%
opposite.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.250 align:middle line:84%
So I want to hear about what
kept inspiring you forward,

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:35.400 align:middle line:84%
from horses, and getting your
anger out, and kickboxing,

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.540 align:middle line:90%
into--

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:37.410 align:middle line:90%
toward this path.

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:40.477 align:middle line:84%
And I got to do a little
racing school action too,

00:32:40.477 --> 00:32:40.680 align:middle line:90%
so that was--

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that'd be so fun.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: It
was a lot of fun.

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:45.102 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I guess there are
some benies of having drug

00:32:45.102 --> 00:32:46.830 align:middle line:84%
money running through
the household.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:49.532 align:middle line:84%
You get to have some cheap
thrills for a little while

00:32:49.532 --> 00:32:50.490 align:middle line:90%
till you find yourself.

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't care if
I lived or I died.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:57.300 align:middle line:84%
I really had that
kind of fervor.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:01.800 align:middle line:90%
And I just had this surrender.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.250 align:middle line:84%
That anchor sort of
translated into action sports,

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:06.600 align:middle line:90%
and just like--

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.220 align:middle line:90%
I was always getting injured.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Always, stuff was
happening to me

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:11.820 align:middle line:84%
because of where that
energy would take me.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.485 align:middle line:84%
Horses, I manage to stay
safe with them, however.

00:33:15.485 --> 00:33:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you managed
to make it through safe.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:20.630 align:middle line:90%
You're now in your adult years.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:22.890 align:middle line:84%
So how did this
start translating

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:26.160 align:middle line:84%
into using your abilities
in a more refined manner

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.805 align:middle line:84%
that started leading you
on the path of healing?

00:33:28.805 --> 00:33:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: So I was very
reluctant to even go into this.

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:37.180 align:middle line:84%
I was told when I
was very young--

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:39.848 align:middle line:84%
and my mom was told,
your daughter's a healer.

00:33:39.848 --> 00:33:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Tiffany, you're a healer.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:42.000 align:middle line:90%
You need to be doing this.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.910 align:middle line:90%
And I was just like, no way.

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:47.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't want any of
this sort of stuff.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:51.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to have anything
to do with this sort of thing.

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.490 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until--
because I actually

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:56.130 align:middle line:84%
was very much a
business-minded type of person,

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:58.380 align:middle line:84%
and I got into the
music industry.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:01.770 align:middle line:10%
And a saving grace to
me was that Ruth Pointer

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:05.460 align:middle line:10%
of The Pointer Sisters
gave me some direction.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:06.663 align:middle line:10%
And she said--

00:34:06.663 --> 00:34:07.830 align:middle line:10%
I just happened to meet her.

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:09.900 align:middle line:10%
Growing up in Los Angeles,
you just meet people.

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I got very
close to the family.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And so where she had given me
a little bit of a direction,

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.560 align:middle line:90%
and said, go be a manager.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.030 align:middle line:84%
You really show
talent because you

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.969 align:middle line:90%
have the ability to do that.

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:23.370 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know what that was.

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:26.580 align:middle line:84%
So I got my job and
starting to do that work.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, I spent 22 years
in the music industry,

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and thinking that that
was really important,

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:34.469 align:middle line:84%
and then really working towards
changing brick-and-mortar

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:35.489 align:middle line:90%
into digital.

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And where that
ended up taking me

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:39.989 align:middle line:84%
was living across the
street from Ground Zero.

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:43.199 align:middle line:10%
Not when the buildings
had fallen originally,

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:45.670 align:middle line:10%
but a little later date when
they were doing the cleanup.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:47.670 align:middle line:10%
And that's when I got
really sick, which I think

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:50.040 align:middle line:10%
we've spoken about before.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Me getting sick--
and I knew, because I

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:57.810 align:middle line:84%
knew from being told in the
past, and I knew in my core

00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:01.780 align:middle line:84%
that that was not my path to
be doing all this other work

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:02.580 align:middle line:90%
for other people.

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:05.610 align:middle line:84%
That I needed to step into
these gifts as a healer.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:06.720 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't want the job.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.008 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want all this medical
knowledge and intuition.

00:35:10.008 --> 00:35:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And responsibility
for other people, really.

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And I put my mom in really
uncomfortable situations

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:17.850 align:middle line:90%
as her daughter.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:19.090 align:middle line:90%
She would say to--

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:20.490 align:middle line:90%
she had this friend--

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:21.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm going all over.

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:22.160 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully, this is OK.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.245 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
fine, that's fine.

00:35:23.245 --> 00:35:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: She had this friend
that would have these recurring

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.270 align:middle line:90%
bladder infections all the time.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And she wore her
jeans really tight.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And she was just this
really beautiful woman,

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.450 align:middle line:90%
and all of this.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And she says this with me
standing there one day.

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, I got
another bladder infection.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, that's because
you have too much coitus.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.055 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even know
what that word meant!

00:35:45.055 --> 00:35:46.154 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:35:46.154 --> 00:35:47.920 align:middle line:90%
I was just like--

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.125 align:middle line:90%
my mom was just mortified.

00:35:50.125 --> 00:35:52.090 align:middle line:84%
This is a woman that
actually takes care of us

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:53.420 align:middle line:90%
from time to time.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.020 align:middle line:84%
But that woman came and
started asking me for advice

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.340 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:59.595 align:middle line:84%
I became somebody-- what
do you think about this?

00:35:59.595 --> 00:36:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And what do you
think about that?

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And so she would just
start governing her life

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.770 align:middle line:84%
based on intuition and things
that I would be offering.

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And how old were you
when you were offering this?

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Oof.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:09.030 align:middle line:90%
Probably 11?

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:09.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:16.190 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of information
flooding into me never stopped.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.790 align:middle line:90%
That was on a regular basis.

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:20.920 align:middle line:84%
What I did with that
information-- sometimes,

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.960 align:middle line:90%
there would just be like, stop.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.645 align:middle line:84%
And I actually had to
cure myself of OCD.

00:36:25.645 --> 00:36:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How was the
OCD showing itself?

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Weird ways.

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:33.130 align:middle line:90%
The way it would show up is--

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:36.220 align:middle line:84%
around Los Angeles,
you drive a lot.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.270 align:middle line:90%
You have to do this.

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:39.010 align:middle line:84%
The OCD would say,
you have to do this.

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:41.140 align:middle line:84%
This voice would say,
you have to do this.

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.880 align:middle line:84%
This was really a
pivotal time because I

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:46.540 align:middle line:84%
was discerning between the
voice that was distracting

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and the voice that
was actually helpful.

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I started learning
this very young, as far as,

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:52.960 align:middle line:90%
what is an intuitive hit?

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.550 align:middle line:90%
What is this ego thing?

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:56.860 align:middle line:84%
What is this thing that's
making the separation?

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But I had to really
course through this kind

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:01.813 align:middle line:84%
of OCD behavior of,
you have to do this.

00:37:01.813 --> 00:37:04.480 align:middle line:84%
You have to caress your steering
wheel this many-- it was always

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.810 align:middle line:90%
things around cars.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:07.870 align:middle line:90%
You have to go this way.

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:10.030 align:middle line:90%
You have to enter in this way.

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, I would
just go in these circles.

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I just had
a fit of, knock it off.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.770 align:middle line:90%
Nothing bad is going to happen.

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:23.140 align:middle line:84%
It was always this
superstition kind of thing.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.960 align:middle line:84%
This is going to happen
if you don't do this.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.880 align:middle line:90%
So one day, I just took it on.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.190 align:middle line:90%
I was like, bring it!

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Just bring it!

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:32.350 align:middle line:84%
If there's something bad
going to happen, fine.

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.000 align:middle line:90%
I've lived through worse.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:34.855 align:middle line:90%
Bring it.

00:37:34.855 --> 00:37:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And so it was just really
challenging the universe.

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:37.930 align:middle line:90%
It was like, OK.

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So I hit a wall with
that egoic kind of thing

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:42.470 align:middle line:84%
that, we're going
to control you.

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:46.630 align:middle line:84%
We're going to keep you in this
small container, versus really

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:49.045 align:middle line:90%
starting to use my intuition.

00:37:49.045 --> 00:37:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now
it's post 9/11.

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:52.210 align:middle line:90%
You're sick.

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Mm.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:55.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:58.270 align:middle line:84%
I was not prepared for what was
happening to me psychically,

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:01.210 align:middle line:84%
emotionally,
spiritually, physically.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:02.950 align:middle line:84%
None of-- I wasn't
prepared for any

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:04.405 align:middle line:90%
of those types of activities.

00:38:04.405 --> 00:38:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You mean in the
environment you found yourself

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:08.325 align:middle line:90%
in post-9/11?

00:38:08.325 --> 00:38:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:12.730 align:middle line:84%
So what was later described
to me by a clairvoyant who

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:15.640 align:middle line:84%
was looking at the
scene and looking at me,

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.280 align:middle line:84%
she said, your heart was
being used as a portal.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Because every night, pretty
much, when I would go to sleep,

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.670 align:middle line:90%
I would be--

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:27.560 align:middle line:84%
we travel to these astral
realms sometimes when we sleep.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I would have
these horrific views

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.915 align:middle line:84%
of people falling, and what
their life stories were,

00:38:33.915 --> 00:38:36.040 align:middle line:84%
as they were falling, and
the different things that

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.530 align:middle line:84%
were happening, and
the stuff that was

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.090 align:middle line:90%
happening on the ground there.

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
really overwhelming.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:43.900 align:middle line:90%
So I--

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or the amount
of trauma in the people

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:48.350 align:middle line:90%
of the city at that time.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I think it's hard for
anyone that wasn't there

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.680 align:middle line:84%
to truly grasp the amount
of collective trauma.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: It's true.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:56.480 align:middle line:90%
It's really true.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.550 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know why--

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.305 align:middle line:90%
me being sensitive that I was--

00:38:59.305 --> 00:39:00.970 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think
anything about it.

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:03.550 align:middle line:90%
My view was directly that hole.

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:04.690 align:middle line:90%
I was living in--

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:06.820 align:middle line:84%
there weren't very many people
living down there at that time.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.987 align:middle line:84%
I think our apartment
building was the only one that

00:39:08.987 --> 00:39:10.900 align:middle line:90%
had people living in it.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So it was that
wake-up call, though,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.100 align:middle line:84%
because no cardiologist or
pulmonologist was healing me.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.990 align:middle line:90%
And I had chronic bronchitis.

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:23.380 align:middle line:84%
I had these bloody noses
that were really horrific

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.080 align:middle line:84%
that I had to get my nose
cauterized many times.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm still dealing
with the fallout

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.730 align:middle line:84%
of having to have
nasal valve collapse

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:32.540 align:middle line:90%
and different things like that.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So there was
toxicity, obviously,

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.670 align:middle line:84%
in the air that I
was dealing with.

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:38.890 align:middle line:84%
But I ended up going
to a medical intuitive.

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you got three
days to make up your mind.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's when I was like, oh!

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
what did she mean?

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Three days to make up
your mind as to how

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.240 align:middle line:90%
you're going to use your life?

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yep.

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:49.502 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:39:49.502 --> 00:39:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: That I was not
on my path, and that she said,

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:55.120 align:middle line:84%
you're supposed to be
doing what I'm doing.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.110 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, uh-uh.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:57.520 align:middle line:90%
It has to be steeped in science.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.980 align:middle line:84%
It has to be steeped with
some sort of background.

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I grew up
around these people

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.430 align:middle line:84%
that just called
themselves healers,

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:06.590 align:middle line:84%
and I thought they were just
doing the spiritual bypassing

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:07.390 align:middle line:90%
sort of thing.

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:09.100 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel that
they were grounded.

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:12.287 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel that they were
really present to even things

00:40:12.287 --> 00:40:13.870 align:middle line:84%
that were going on
in their own lives,

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and they were trying
to heal other people's.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So that just didn't
settle well with me.

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:21.710 align:middle line:84%
So I knew I had to
deal with stuff.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:24.850 align:middle line:10%
So that's really what ended up
taking me to Holos University,

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:27.820 align:middle line:10%
and then doing that
really deep dive.

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.860 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And so when
you did the deep dive,

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:33.250 align:middle line:10%
and you start going into
this vagus nerve complex--

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:35.140 align:middle line:10%
which is fascinating
because it has

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.370 align:middle line:10%
to do with issues of
safety and survival.

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:40.380 align:middle line:84%
So you just made, just like you
did with your kickboxing, race

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.400 align:middle line:84%
car driving, horse
jumping or whatever

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.820 align:middle line:84%
you're doing, dressage,
and everything else,

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:50.470 align:middle line:84%
you did the deep dive toward
the most pointed thing that

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:53.690 align:middle line:84%
was really being reflected from
your own life at that time,

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:54.490 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This
notion of safety.

00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:59.960 align:middle line:90%
And everyone deals with it.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:04.990 align:middle line:84%
We look to the amygdala,
often, as the culprit

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:08.860 align:middle line:84%
that's running our lives
and the whole fear complex.

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And people have done
enough research.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:14.020 align:middle line:84%
The people watching this show
are often very well-researched

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and really intuitive and
brilliant in their own right.

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:19.570 align:middle line:10%
And so most people have heard
about the brain complex,

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:23.930 align:middle line:10%
the limbic system, the amygdala,
the fight-or-flight centers

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:24.730 align:middle line:10%
of the brain.

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:26.380 align:middle line:10%
But very few people
really understand

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.280 align:middle line:10%
much about the vagus nerve.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.490 align:middle line:84%
But I will say this
on a personal note.

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Because of my own fragility in
my body with this very strong

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:39.520 align:middle line:84%
personality, my body can be
extraordinarily resilient

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and extraordinarily
vulnerable because I

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:43.570 align:middle line:90%
have a unique situation.

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:46.930 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing that kept
coming up over and over when I

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:51.070 align:middle line:84%
go see my very extraordinarily
skilled and talented

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:53.980 align:middle line:84%
kinesiologist-- he teaches
around the world now--

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:56.360 align:middle line:84%
is the vagus nerve kept
coming up over and over.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.690 align:middle line:90%
And what I notice is before--

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I thought, that's interesting
that the emphasis keeps

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:03.470 align:middle line:90%
coming back to the vagus nerve.

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And fear is the trigger
when I go unconscious,

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.480 align:middle line:84%
if I have one of these
Addison's crisis events

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and go into seizure, it is the
emotion of fight-or-flight.

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:22.207 align:middle line:84%
It is the emotion of fear, and
the ability to control fear,

00:42:22.207 --> 00:42:24.040 align:middle line:84%
that determines the
outcome of those events.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned over the
years how to control the fear.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that doesn't
come up anymore

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.610 align:middle line:90%
when I go to the kinesiologist.

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:33.160 align:middle line:84%
The vagus nerve seems
to be deemphasized

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.720 align:middle line:90%
whenever he's working on me.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:38.200 align:middle line:84%
But it's the fear complex
and the emotional management,

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.125 align:middle line:84%
I think, that has
triggered that shift.

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Absolutely.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so I'm just
giving one really interesting

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:50.350 align:middle line:84%
little personal example,
but you take it further.

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:52.720 align:middle line:84%
We've had a wonderful
time hearing your story.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.980 align:middle line:90%
I love hearing your story.

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:56.600 align:middle line:84%
We still have about 20
minutes left to chat,

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.415 align:middle line:84%
so the good news is we can get
into this a little bit more,

00:42:59.415 --> 00:43:00.790 align:middle line:84%
because we've
already established

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:03.760 align:middle line:84%
some of this in our
previous conversation here.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So anyone that wants
to look at that

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:07.900 align:middle line:84%
can go back and see
it in depth where

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.870 align:middle line:84%
we've come from in our previous
conversation in the Gaia

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:11.780 align:middle line:90%
archives.

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:15.220 align:middle line:84%
But from here, let's talk about
this fear complex and the need

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:18.160 align:middle line:84%
for maturation on a
spiritual level with society,

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:21.610 align:middle line:84%
because we have been
looking for easy ways out.

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people watching
this show have done so as well.

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:25.900 align:middle line:90%
I have done it.

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:28.120 align:middle line:90%
I've been on my New Age journey.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Let someone tell you the
truth and you're enlightened.

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:31.570 align:middle line:90%
No, it doesn't work like that.

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: No, there's work.

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.403 align:middle line:90%
There's really work involved.

00:43:34.403 --> 00:43:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're in this
physical body in order

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:38.290 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do
that, I believe.

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:45.430 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of information
right now in neurobiology

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:47.420 align:middle line:90%
about the default mode network.

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is partly dealing
with this fear complex.

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:53.040 align:middle line:90%
And the vagus piece--

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.910 align:middle line:84%
in something that
I was learning more

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:58.450 align:middle line:84%
from having speaking with
Stephen Porges yesterday,

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:01.510 align:middle line:84%
we can learn this thing
called vagal efficiency.

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:04.120 align:middle line:84%
We can learn where
our own brakes are.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:08.800 align:middle line:84%
You had to learn how in order
to steer the hormonal cascades

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.200 align:middle line:84%
from not essentially going
into this whole other series

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.000 align:middle line:90%
of events.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.875 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Horrible grand
mal seizures, basically.

00:44:14.875 --> 00:44:15.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's case in
point of how it is

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.640 align:middle line:90%
that we can control our mind.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.830 align:middle line:84%
The thing that I have been
working with with myself

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and other people now that's
becoming more and more obvious

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:31.030 align:middle line:84%
is that we can
either be defaulters,

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:32.320 align:middle line:90%
or we can be creators.

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And let's talk
about what the two look like.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.300 align:middle line:84%
So the defaulter is
somebody who is continuing

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:42.160 align:middle line:84%
to act in that area within
the limbic system called

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.490 align:middle line:90%
the default mode network.

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:44.365 align:middle line:90%
It's got the program.

00:44:44.365 --> 00:44:45.505 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's purely reactive.

00:44:45.505 --> 00:44:46.305 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: It is.

00:44:46.305 --> 00:44:50.410 align:middle line:84%
It is purely reactive
in that whatever

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:52.390 align:middle line:84%
it is that our
emotions are based off

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:56.410 align:middle line:84%
of-- because the brain doesn't
have emotional signaling.

00:44:56.410 --> 00:45:01.600 align:middle line:84%
But our patterns are in
our whole life experience.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.210 align:middle line:84%
So it gives way to
all the hormonals.

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:05.920 align:middle line:90%
Every thought creates a hormone.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Exactly, and I
don't think people understand.

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:10.990 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
a sensitive body,

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:14.680 align:middle line:84%
you're not as aware of
the chemical cascade

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:17.620 align:middle line:84%
that's happening almost
with each and every thought.

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: It is.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:18.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And fear is
attached to a thought.

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a flood of chemicals.

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:24.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:26.930 align:middle line:90%
So we can either choose.

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:29.172 align:middle line:90%
And what I appreciate about--

00:45:29.172 --> 00:45:31.020 align:middle line:90%
there's several points to this.

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.740 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
I've been teaching my clients--

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:36.700 align:middle line:90%
and I've had to do for myself--

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:37.500 align:middle line:90%
is stop.

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.120 align:middle line:90%
I like using dog commands.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:39.950 align:middle line:90%
Leave it.

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:40.420 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sit.

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Sit.

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:42.980 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.940 align:middle line:90%
Just give yourself a pause.

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:48.570 align:middle line:10%
And Sri Nisargadatta
Maharaj, who

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:50.400 align:middle line:10%
wrote a book called
"I Am That," he

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.980 align:middle line:10%
speaks about saying,
that's interesting.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.680 align:middle line:10%
So there's this--
because we have,

00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:00.000 align:middle line:10%
in the vagus nerve,
this reflexive ability.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.840 align:middle line:84%
We, with our mind, can
say, stop this reaction.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:07.170 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to let it go
in this afferent efferent

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:10.095 align:middle line:84%
up-down signaling of the
body where you get nervous,

00:46:10.095 --> 00:46:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden,
before you know it,

00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:14.700 align:middle line:90%
you're pooing in your pants.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.310 align:middle line:84%
People have different
responses to different things.

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:20.040 align:middle line:90%
So we can put the brake on.

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And that brake-- to me-- is
saying to yourself, pause.

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.160 align:middle line:90%
Leave it.

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.550 align:middle line:90%
Chill.

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you take it a
step further by saying, that's

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.443 align:middle line:84%
interesting, you're
being able to step out

00:46:32.443 --> 00:46:33.360 align:middle line:90%
of yourself a little--

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: As an observer.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: An observer.

00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:35.910 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And witness what's happening
so that you are not

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.130 align:middle line:84%
becoming the effect
of the situation,

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and further, a cause
of taking yourself

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:48.195 align:middle line:84%
in this wound-up state where
nothing good comes of it.

00:46:48.195 --> 00:46:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:53.040 align:middle line:84%
In my case, what I'll often
do is, if I feel that it's--

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:53.980 align:middle line:90%
for whatever reason.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.440 align:middle line:84%
It could be food
poisoning, even.

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.050 align:middle line:84%
If something trips over the
edge, when the feelings start--

00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:00.570 align:middle line:84%
which it's a horrible
feeling, because you

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:01.920 align:middle line:90%
know where it's headed.

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:06.000 align:middle line:84%
But if I say, OK, we've been
through this many times.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to lay my body down.

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:09.480 align:middle line:90%
Take care of me.

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.320 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And I just relax
and lay my body down

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:15.290 align:middle line:84%
so not too much harm can come,
in the middle of the floor.

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:16.738 align:middle line:90%
No things around me.

00:47:16.738 --> 00:47:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I just say,
take care of me.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And sometime later,
I come back around.

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.445 align:middle line:90%
But it's a peaceful--

00:47:23.445 --> 00:47:25.628 align:middle line:84%
it's not like it used to
be where I would fight it

00:47:25.628 --> 00:47:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and say, no, no, no,
don't let this happen,

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:29.640 align:middle line:84%
don't let this happen,
which would make it worse

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:30.950 align:middle line:90%
and I'd end up in the ER.

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:33.145 align:middle line:84%
Now, I almost never
go to the ER anymore.

00:47:33.145 --> 00:47:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: And that what
you just described is the fear

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.320 align:middle line:90%
center.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.950 align:middle line:90%
So that's what is set off.

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And so it will be the
pattern of the history that

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:42.280 align:middle line:90%
will set off that fear center.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.810 align:middle line:10%
So I have my own version
of the triune brain.

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:48.900 align:middle line:10%
The triune brain-- he
described the hind brain,

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.420 align:middle line:10%
the middle brain, and
the frontal cortex

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.580 align:middle line:10%
as being these mammalian
constructs that

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.540 align:middle line:10%
have been evolving over time.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So the hind brain
is our oldest brain.

00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.790 align:middle line:84%
It's known as the
reptilian brain.

00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:02.550 align:middle line:90%
I say, that's know your history.

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:05.670 align:middle line:84%
The middle brain
is newer, but it's

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:08.370 align:middle line:90%
where the emotional systems--

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:10.830 align:middle line:84%
it's not so much that
there's emotional signals,

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:13.110 align:middle line:84%
but there's
emotionality to how it

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:15.980 align:middle line:84%
is that we relate to things
that are going on in our lives.

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:19.630 align:middle line:84%
That signaling happens
in that limbic system.

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:22.080 align:middle line:90%
So I say, that's know yourself.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:25.140 align:middle line:84%
So the example of what
you give for yourself

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.620 align:middle line:84%
is that you know what has
happened historically,

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and you know that
you have to navigate

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:32.760 align:middle line:84%
these waters a little
differently in order

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.080 align:middle line:90%
to make a change.

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:36.360 align:middle line:10%
And then the frontal
cortex is newer

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.580 align:middle line:10%
in the mammalian structure.

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:41.220 align:middle line:10%
And that is having to do
with, know where you're going.

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:43.410 align:middle line:10%
So know your history,
know yourself,

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:44.760 align:middle line:10%
and know where you're going.

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't know
where we're going,

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:49.890 align:middle line:84%
if we don't put any map for
us-- and I'm not just talking

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:50.760 align:middle line:90%
about goals.

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.200 align:middle line:84%
I am talking about,
what are your values?

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.990 align:middle line:84%
What are the things
that are important?

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:58.210 align:middle line:84%
That then we go
back to our default.

00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:00.362 align:middle line:84%
So if we're not
purposeful about that--

00:49:00.362 --> 00:49:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and this is something that I
see in our spiritual community

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:04.110 align:middle line:90%
happen a great deal.

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:05.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm guilty of the same thing.

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:09.540 align:middle line:84%
God, dear God, universe, source,
put me where I need to be.

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:11.040 align:middle line:90%
Just show me where I need to be.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:12.270 align:middle line:90%
That's a bit of a cop-out.

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's a total cop-out.

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And I have said this
to so many friends,

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:21.180 align:middle line:84%
especially living in
Sedona, because it's-- well,

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:24.210 align:middle line:84%
it's known for having an
overwhelming amount of faith

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:27.690 align:middle line:84%
and spirit, to the point
where one completely absolves

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:29.040 align:middle line:90%
themselves of responsibility.

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.750 align:middle line:90%
I see this all the time.

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:32.100 align:middle line:90%
It's, oh, it doesn't matter.

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Spirit will lead me.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Spirit will show me the way.

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:39.540 align:middle line:84%
A year later, two years later,
spirit hasn't shown the way.

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not listening--
and this is what I believe.

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.570 align:middle line:84%
They're not listening
to their own true voice.

00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:47.060 align:middle line:90%
That will lead them.

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:50.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not spirit-- some
external spirit's job

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:51.970 align:middle line:90%
to show anyone the way.

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: No.

00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's to our extent
that we will nurture

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:56.160 align:middle line:90%
that vertical connection.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.585 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:49:57.585 --> 00:49:58.840 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more.

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: So the
horizontal is fear, anxiety.

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:03.580 align:middle line:84%
That's where we're nailing
ourself to the cross,

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:04.380 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:05.580 align:middle line:90%
It's just like, oh my god.

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:06.390 align:middle line:90%
I can't move.

00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I've got anxiety that's just
thwarted all of my efforts.

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And what I find on anxiety is
the opposite of some of this,

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.080 align:middle line:84%
is that that's
fast-moving energy.

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.690 align:middle line:90%
It needs to have a channel.

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:20.870 align:middle line:84%
But If we're sitting on
that because of fears, then

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:22.580 align:middle line:84%
now we're doing
ourselves a disservice

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:25.040 align:middle line:84%
for what it is that we're
supposed to be bringing in.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Sitting on ideas.

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:29.270 align:middle line:90%
Not moving things forward.

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:31.692 align:middle line:84%
And then that's not using
our frontal cortex, which

00:50:31.692 --> 00:50:32.900 align:middle line:90%
is our executive functioning.

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: So we need
to be thinking about that.

00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And OK, so now, I want
to get to this part,

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:43.190 align:middle line:84%
because here you're
saying-- we're

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:45.980 align:middle line:84%
talking about the research
you've done with the Bio-Well.

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And so you're able to look
at how this energy expresses

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:54.380 align:middle line:84%
itself in people, and moving
us past karma to grace.

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:57.470 align:middle line:84%
We have a little bit of time
left, so bridge those two.

00:50:57.470 --> 00:51:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Taking spiritual responsibility,
moving us past the karma that--

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.770 align:middle line:90%
karma can be seen as anything.

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:06.950 align:middle line:84%
It's simply a balancing
out of energies.

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And so a balancing out of
proportion or imbalanced

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.920 align:middle line:84%
energies toward a state
of grace or balance.

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:13.760 align:middle line:90%
So go there.

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:15.800 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for that.

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:19.700 align:middle line:84%
So karma, yes, also has to do
with this trans-generational

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:20.570 align:middle line:90%
type of thing.

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:22.160 align:middle line:84%
So we're either on
this karmic wheel

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.260 align:middle line:84%
where we're constantly
recreating the same thing

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.480 align:middle line:84%
that our families
created, or from our past

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.105 align:middle line:84%
because there's still
something that we

00:51:28.105 --> 00:51:29.360 align:middle line:90%
need to extract and get.

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:33.050 align:middle line:84%
So that can be
contrasting situations.

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:35.330 align:middle line:84%
The situations that
we get ourselves in.

00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:37.150 align:middle line:84%
The key question is,
what did I learn?

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:39.560 align:middle line:84%
What am I going to do
to get myself out of?

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:43.430 align:middle line:84%
That is actually using our
frontal cortex strategies

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:46.370 align:middle line:84%
in being able to ask ourselves
key questions to get ourselves

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:47.990 align:middle line:90%
out of that loop.

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So from karma to
grace, the bridge--

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:54.080 align:middle line:90%
what I'm finding-- is gratitude.

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:57.980 align:middle line:84%
The vehicle to
grace is gratitude.

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And we have more and
more research coming out.

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Paul, my beloved, has done
this beautiful research

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.050 align:middle line:90%
in this area.

00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm seeing
evidence in my practice,

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.210 align:middle line:84%
where people have
really got it, that's

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:15.830 align:middle line:84%
like they grok something much
deeper, just be grateful.

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And I know I've said it
before, but no matter

00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:21.292 align:middle line:84%
what's happening in front
of you, say thank you.

00:52:21.292 --> 00:52:23.000 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know
why you're saying it,

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.670 align:middle line:84%
but say thank you,
because it starts to move

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:27.740 align:middle line:90%
the energy from where it was.

00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:29.780 align:middle line:90%
So karma to grace.

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:33.500 align:middle line:84%
The middle portion is
finding that gratitude.

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
being grateful.

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:36.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a practice.

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And that is spiritual
maturity, is

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:41.623 align:middle line:84%
being able to practice
that gratitude.

00:52:41.623 --> 00:52:43.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not more time
on the cushion.

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:44.790 align:middle line:90%
No, I agree with that.

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:46.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'll share
a quick anecdote

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.080 align:middle line:90%
that proves this point.

00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Recently, I was
in New York City.

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to be doing
an interview on Gaia

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:53.990 align:middle line:84%
with this woman,
Dr. Lana Morrow.

00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And she's created
a technology which

00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:59.750 align:middle line:84%
is another neuro
modulation technology where

00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:02.420 align:middle line:90%
you play a little game.

00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:04.130 align:middle line:84%
You're hooked up
to the electrodes.

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is interfacing
with the screen.

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:08.720 align:middle line:84%
You got little Pokemon guys, and
you're playing a little game.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And in it, what was so
fascinating about it--

00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:14.240 align:middle line:90%
I tried it.

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned
was what happened

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:21.800 align:middle line:84%
when you went into grace
by way of gratitude,

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:25.940 align:middle line:84%
love, or a subtle sense
of joy where you were not

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:31.860 align:middle line:84%
pressing on yourself, along with
prefrontal focused intention.

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:35.198 align:middle line:90%
And to combine those traits.

00:53:35.198 --> 00:53:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Because you can
watch it in real-time

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:38.350 align:middle line:84%
what's happening,
because you score.

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:42.170 align:middle line:84%
Your scores start skyrocketing
when you get into the zone.

00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:43.700 align:middle line:90%
And so I was playing with it.

00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed this
incredible thing.

00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And she had told me it
was true about gratitude.

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:51.890 align:middle line:84%
But you have to see if you
get the results yourself.

00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And so as I was
playing with it, when

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:57.260 align:middle line:84%
I go into this sense of
love, joy, gratitude,

00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:58.760 align:middle line:90%
the score would skyrocket.

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, you get
your neuro feedback on it.

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:02.510 align:middle line:90%
And it helped me understand.

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:05.157 align:middle line:84%
If we could live our lives
with clear intention--

00:54:05.157 --> 00:54:07.490 align:middle line:84%
because you have to be focused
in order to make the game

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:09.380 align:middle line:84%
do what you're
supposed to be doing.

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:13.460 align:middle line:84%
But relaxed in this state
of subtle sense of joy,

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:15.740 align:middle line:84%
a subtle sense of
gratitude, subtle sense of--

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:17.240 align:middle line:90%
these are subtle senses.

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.860 align:middle line:90%
This relaxation.

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:22.880 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the brain firing
up and pouring all of its energy

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:25.810 align:middle line:90%
into coherence.

00:54:25.810 --> 00:54:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And with that
coherence, imagine what

00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:32.480 align:middle line:84%
we could do as a species
with joyful gratitude

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:34.610 align:middle line:90%
behind our focused intention.

00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching
it in real-time,

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:38.087 align:middle line:90%
and my scores were way up there.

00:54:38.087 --> 00:54:39.045 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Beautiful.

00:54:39.045 --> 00:54:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so I was
watching it proving itself out,

00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:41.930 align:middle line:90%
is the point.

00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: That's beautiful.

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And the Bio-Well actually
measures that coherence.

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:47.960 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I see.

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:50.540 align:middle line:84%
So if a person has
been operating out

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:55.370 align:middle line:84%
of this very anxious place,
and they make the shift,

00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:58.240 align:middle line:84%
I can show them
via the Bio-Well.

00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:59.240 align:middle line:90%
This is what's happened.

00:54:59.240 --> 00:54:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And you brought
yourself into coherence.

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is where
technology is really beautiful,

00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:05.480 align:middle line:84%
in that it's proving out
things that have been tropes

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:06.860 align:middle line:90%
in the New Age world.

00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Basically, follow your bliss.

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not all
that easy, because if you

00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:14.870 align:middle line:84%
follow your bliss, money will
follow you, All the bumper

00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:16.070 align:middle line:90%
stickers.

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:18.560 align:middle line:84%
When in fact, there is
truth to these things,

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:21.170 align:middle line:90%
but not in a simplistic way.

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:23.840 align:middle line:84%
It still takes your full
engagement, intention.

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:27.100 align:middle line:84%
It takes some effort, and
it takes that relaxation.

00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:28.575 align:middle line:90%
And it takes faith.

00:55:28.575 --> 00:55:29.375 align:middle line:90%
Faith in yourself.

00:55:29.375 --> 00:55:30.667 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Faith in yourself.

00:55:30.667 --> 00:55:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Faith in the
ability that you can do this.

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Not faith that
someone or something

00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:37.010 align:middle line:90%
is going to do it for you.

00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: That's right.

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:38.240 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Big difference.

00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:41.930 align:middle line:84%
We only have a couple minutes
left, so go ahead and take us

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:45.740 align:middle line:84%
where you'd like us to go to a
finishing point in this story

00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:48.290 align:middle line:84%
of your own life's
wonderful challenges

00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:50.210 align:middle line:84%
that led you to these
wonderful discoveries

00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and what you do with them, and
what you do with your clients

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:53.040 align:middle line:90%
with this.

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:56.870 align:middle line:84%
I can look back at all
of these historic events,

00:55:56.870 --> 00:56:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and yes, they were tumultuous
and nutty at the time.

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And really, you
don't wish anybody

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.553 align:middle line:84%
to live through some of
the stuff that I have seen.

00:56:07.553 --> 00:56:08.720 align:middle line:90%
But I wouldn't take it back.

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.220 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't do
anything different.

00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:12.700 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't trade
karma with anybody.

00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:14.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you ask
anybody that question,

00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:15.860 align:middle line:84%
do you want to trade
karma with so-and-so,

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:17.443 align:middle line:84%
and you know they've
had a great life,

00:56:17.443 --> 00:56:19.970 align:middle line:84%
most people say no
no matter how bad.

00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So the biggest thing
and the takeaway for me

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:24.290 align:middle line:90%
is to not live by condition.

00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And that gratitude
as a practice can--

00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:30.110 align:middle line:90%
this is the practice of it.

00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:34.910 align:middle line:84%
To not be just grateful
based on a condition,

00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:37.980 align:middle line:84%
because that is not what
I'm talking about here.

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:40.310 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about it
being a mind switch,

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:42.560 align:middle line:84%
like what you were describing
of where you can get to,

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:45.090 align:middle line:90%
because there's only love.

00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:46.430 align:middle line:90%
There's only love.

00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:48.680 align:middle line:90%
That is the creation force.

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:51.420 align:middle line:84%
But we've so
adulterated the love.

00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:55.250 align:middle line:84%
So if we get back to
that place, then we

00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:58.040 align:middle line:84%
can put the brake on
the vagus, stop it

00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:02.090 align:middle line:84%
from having this crazy reaction
in our bodies, if it is,

00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and start to use
it purposefully.

00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:06.320 align:middle line:90%
And use the contrasting events.

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:07.685 align:middle line:90%
Go back, review.

00:57:07.685 --> 00:57:09.620 align:middle line:84%
What is it that I
learned from that?

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:11.420 align:middle line:90%
Grab the gold.

00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Buddha said, we're
all golden Buddhas.

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:16.880 align:middle line:84%
We just have to
polish the mud off.

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:22.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is our polishing, to
see, oh, wow, that led to this.

00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:23.510 align:middle line:90%
This led to this.

00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:24.927 align:middle line:84%
We all have
experiences like that.

00:57:24.927 --> 00:57:25.727 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We do.

00:57:25.727 --> 00:57:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have
to start understanding

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:29.750 align:middle line:84%
where discernment
comes in, because we're

00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:32.810 align:middle line:84%
giving our attention to a lot
of things that hold really

00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:35.180 align:middle line:84%
dark and negative
energies, oftentimes,

00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:37.150 align:middle line:84%
by involving ourselves
in entertainment that's

00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:39.402 align:middle line:84%
super dark, by
listening to the news,

00:57:39.402 --> 00:57:41.360 align:middle line:84%
for people who are still--
a lot of our viewers

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:43.610 align:middle line:84%
don't do that anymore, but
still listening to the news

00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:46.920 align:middle line:84%
at night, which is built to
have these addictive reactions

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:51.350 align:middle line:84%
to draw this default mode
out of people, literally.

00:57:51.350 --> 00:57:53.210 align:middle line:90%
In fact, the world is set up--

00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:56.180 align:middle line:84%
the content of the news
is designed that way

00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:59.300 align:middle line:84%
to set up this default mode
of functioning so people never

00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:02.487 align:middle line:84%
get to the creative mode
of response to life,

00:58:02.487 --> 00:58:03.695 align:middle line:90%
rather than reaction to life.

00:58:03.695 --> 00:58:04.495 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:58:04.495 --> 00:58:05.810 align:middle line:90%
It's what the advertisers want.

00:58:05.810 --> 00:58:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's what the
advertisers want because then

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:08.490 align:middle line:90%
you need their product.

00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:09.365 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:58:09.365 --> 00:58:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this
is a vicious cycle.

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.258 align:middle line:84%
The world around
us does not support

00:58:13.258 --> 00:58:14.300 align:middle line:90%
our creative involvement.

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: No.

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:17.510 align:middle line:84%
But we're either in default,
or we're in creation.

00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:58:18.350 --> 00:58:21.110 align:middle line:84%
So that has to be a
choice from the outset.

00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And so to not put ourselves
in negative circumstance,

00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:26.900 align:middle line:84%
among negative people,
negative thoughts all the time,

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:29.090 align:middle line:84%
which automatically
throw us into default.

00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:30.890 align:middle line:90%
So it starts with discernment.

00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:33.128 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, it
becomes a different kind

00:58:33.128 --> 00:58:35.420 align:middle line:84%
of choice as to how we're
going to move forward, right?

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:36.545 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Choice is key.

00:58:36.545 --> 00:58:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Choice moves the energy.

00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:39.200 align:middle line:90%
Choice moves the energy.

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.520 align:middle line:10%
And you can make a bad--

00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:43.100 align:middle line:10%
I won't say "bad,"
necessarily, but it's

00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:45.980 align:middle line:10%
going to be a challenging
choice, or one

00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:47.090 align:middle line:10%
that's a new choice.

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:48.800 align:middle line:90%
Any final words?

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:50.600 align:middle line:90%
We have just a few seconds left.

00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: Oh, I
adore being with you.

00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:55.700 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for the exploration
that we get to do,

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:57.255 align:middle line:10%
these expanded states
that we get to.

00:58:57.255 --> 00:58:58.130 align:middle line:10%
There's so much more.

00:58:58.130 --> 00:59:00.730 align:middle line:10%
We had three pages of stuff
that we could have talked about.

00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:04.610 align:middle line:84%
We didn't get to any of
that, but I had a lot of fun.

00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Me too.

00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I love
stories like yours,

00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:09.960 align:middle line:84%
because once you
pull the mask off--

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:11.670 align:middle line:84%
people have this
perception of you

00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:15.140 align:middle line:84%
as is this lovely angelic being
who heals people and helps,

00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:18.750 align:middle line:84%
and is so clear in their
articulation of their subject

00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:19.550 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:59:19.550 --> 00:59:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And to find out the race girl
kickboxer behind it I think

00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:26.570 align:middle line:84%
has been absolutely
fascinating, because I

00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:28.350 align:middle line:84%
didn't know that part of your
story either until today.

00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:29.180 align:middle line:90%
OK, very good.

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So Tiffany, thank
you for being vulnerable

00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:32.000 align:middle line:90%
and sharing that.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.007 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get
together another time

00:59:34.007 --> 00:59:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and talk about the other
three pages of stuff, OK?

00:59:36.090 --> 00:59:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: I
look forward to it.

00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Regina.

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:40.520 align:middle line:90%
