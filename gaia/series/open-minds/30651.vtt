00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In
my last conversation

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.640 align:middle line:10%
with Michael Cremo, we discussed
the way in which science

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.700 align:middle line:10%
filters knowledge to
conveniently fit with commonly

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.030 align:middle line:10%
held views, particularly the
religious kind of devotion

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.320 align:middle line:10%
to Darwinism.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.210 align:middle line:10%
In this interview,
we show the evidence

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.630 align:middle line:10%
for the extreme antiquity
of the human race,

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.740 align:middle line:10%
leaving little argument
for the position

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.220 align:middle line:10%
that we evolved
from apes-- no less,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.574 align:middle line:10%
only a few thousand years ago.

00:00:42.574 --> 00:00:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that came up

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.780 align:middle line:84%
just before we went on today,
Jay Weidner came in and said,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle line:84%
have you seen this article
that just came out?

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And it says 300 million
year old tooth wheel

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:84%
found in Russian coal,
embedded in coal.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And what was the
original-- well,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.260 align:middle line:84%
right now it's in the
"Huffington Post."

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:84%
300 million year old
tool of some kind,

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:90%
it was a gear of some kind.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Does that fit at all
within your understanding

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.830 align:middle line:90%
of our human antiquity?

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.450 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHAEL CREMO: Yes, it does.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.200 align:middle line:10%
I think humans have been
present for hundreds

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:10%
of millions of years on Earth.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.080 align:middle line:10%
And there are other
discoveries that

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:10%
are consistent with
this most recently

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.457 align:middle line:10%
reported one from Russia.

00:01:28.457 --> 00:01:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Of course, these things
always need further study.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: But there are, in
the scientific literature,

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.810 align:middle line:84%
reports of discoveries that
are consistent with this.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.400 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the year
1862, a scientific journal

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.860 align:middle line:84%
called "The Geologist"
published an interesting report.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:84%
A human skeleton was found
90 feet below the surface

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.360 align:middle line:84%
of the ground in Macoupin
County in the state of Illinois

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And we got in touch
with geologists

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:84%
of the State Geological
Survey of Illinois.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And we asked them how
old is the formation

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.770 align:middle line:90%
at that level at that place?

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And they said about
300 million years.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's consistent with
this recent report from Russia

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.650 align:middle line:84%
of this aluminum object,
gear-shaped object, that

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.990 align:middle line:84%
was found in coal
deposits of Vladivostok

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.260 align:middle line:90%
in Far Eastern Russia.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And there are reports
from the same time period.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:84%
In the year 1892, a woman
named Mrs. Robert Culp

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.550 align:middle line:84%
was putting a piece of coal
into a coal burning stove.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.965 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big piece of
coal, so she broke it in half.

00:02:57.965 --> 00:03:03.432 align:middle line:84%
And inside she found a gold
chain about 10 inches long.

00:03:03.432 --> 00:03:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A gold chain?

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.931 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, real,
sophisticated little gold

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.220 align:middle line:90%
links?

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.808 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yeah.

00:03:09.808 --> 00:03:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to get from
the report the name of the mine

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.210 align:middle line:90%
that this object came from.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And we asked geologists how
old is the coal in that mine?

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And again, they said
about 300 million years.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is a vast
expanse between these two

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.660 align:middle line:90%
places, Vladivostok and England.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well, this would
be from the United States,

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.780 align:middle line:90%
from the state of Illinois.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, this one was
from the state of Illinois.

00:03:42.495 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Right.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.676 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, got you.

00:03:43.676 --> 00:03:44.967 align:middle line:90%
Even more vast reach.

00:03:44.967 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yeah.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.586 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: And then
there was another case

00:03:47.586 --> 00:03:51.480 align:middle line:84%
of a gold thread being
found in England.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.940 align:middle line:84%
That was reported in
an English newspaper

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.430 align:middle line:90%
from the 19th century.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And that, again, was about
from the same time period.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So they're very
interesting discoveries.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.520 align:middle line:84%
They completely
contradict everything

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.215 align:middle line:84%
that most scientists now
think about human origin.

00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into
many, many more of these.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.370 align:middle line:84%
However, when we look at it
from kind of a classical,

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.340 align:middle line:84%
as it's taught now,
archaeological point

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.130 align:middle line:84%
of view, what would be said of
what was going on on the Earth

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.530 align:middle line:90%
300 million years ago?

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.230 align:middle line:90%
What would that depiction be?

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well, according to
the classical understanding,

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.430 align:middle line:84%
that would be during the
Carboniferous period.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And they would say
at that time there

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:46.070 align:middle line:84%
were jungles of
gymnosperm plants.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And gymnosperm means not of
the flowering plant family,

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.060 align:middle line:84%
in other words,
things like ferns

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.230 align:middle line:84%
and other types of
plants of that nature.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And there would have
been amphibians.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:84%
This would be from
before the time

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.580 align:middle line:84%
of the dinosaurs,
certainly no human life

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.700 align:middle line:84%
according to the standard
picture of things.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Just various types of amphibians
and plants on the Earth.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're looking
at a huge discretion

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.820 align:middle line:84%
here in terms of what
was actually populating

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:84%
the planet 300
million years ago.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:84%
If we have something
capable, a human,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.630 align:middle line:84%
capable of creating an
instrument of some kind,

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:84%
a tool of some kind-- they
say it's a tooth wheel?

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.620 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like a gear
box of some kind?

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well,
actually it's a bar,

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:84%
it's a bar-shaped
structure that has

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:48.340 align:middle line:84%
what appear to be gears on
it that-- You know, they--

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.670 align:middle line:84%
In different types of machines
that we have today, there

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:58.640 align:middle line:84%
are these gear bars that
operate in connection with gear

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.780 align:middle line:84%
wheels that are
part of machines.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.714 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:01.714 --> 00:06:02.650 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So that existed, a finally
fabricated gold chain

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.570 align:middle line:90%
existed 300 million years ago.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.070 align:middle line:90%
We do have a huge discrepancy.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.524 align:middle line:84%
And you studied
this from a couple

00:06:15.524 --> 00:06:16.690 align:middle line:90%
of different points of view.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.390 align:middle line:84%
You've done a vast amount
of research as documented

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.900 align:middle line:84%
in your book, "Forbidden
Archeology," which

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.350 align:middle line:84%
is more than 900 pages
of evidence for this.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:84%
In addition, you
are also a devotee

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.590 align:middle line:84%
of an aspect of the
Vedas that talks

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.260 align:middle line:84%
about the large, long
cycles of history

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:84%
where human beings are
wiped out or somehow,

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.850 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a cataclysm
or what, disappear,

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.140 align:middle line:84%
re-evolve-- not evolve--
reappear with their knowledge

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:90%
intact apparently.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And this keeps on and
on and on for how long?

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Over what span of
time would the Puranas

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.520 align:middle line:90%
say humankind has been here?

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:84%
They would say that humans
have appeared and reappeared

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.380 align:middle line:84%
in the course of
vast cycles of time.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.380 align:middle line:84%
The basic unit of
this cyclical time

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.690 align:middle line:84%
is called the kalpa or the
Day of the Brahma, which

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.797 align:middle line:90%
lasts about 4 billion years.

00:07:15.797 --> 00:07:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we discussed
that a little bit

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.970 align:middle line:90%
in our last conversation.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.860 align:middle line:84%
How many of those cycles
have there already been?

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Endless
numbers of them.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.419 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we could have
been there trillions of years?

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:34.210 align:middle line:84%
But according to the current
kalpa, the most recent creation

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.350 align:middle line:84%
or manifestation
of that, we would

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:43.220 align:middle line:84%
expect to find evidence for a
human presence going back say,

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.110 align:middle line:90%
about 2 billion years roughly.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And before that, it would be
like if you had a computer disk

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.924 align:middle line:84%
and you wiped out
the evidence on it.

00:07:56.924 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: You know, that's what
happens at the end of a kalpa.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:08.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like whatever is there in
the material manifestation just

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.320 align:middle line:84%
gets wiped away, so that
you have a clean disk.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.210 align:middle line:84%
So when the next kalpa
or creation event comes,

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.326 align:middle line:90%
it gets written on again.

00:08:18.326 --> 00:08:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's why
you wouldn't find evidence

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.360 align:middle line:84%
that would necessarily date back
into the hundreds of billions

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.970 align:middle line:84%
or trillions of years even if
you had the instrumentation

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:27.470 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yeah.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:33.900 align:middle line:84%
According to the Veda
cosmology, the universe

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.330 align:middle line:90%
is trillions of years old.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.659 align:middle line:84%
And it will continue to
exist for trillions of years.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:46.620 align:middle line:84%
But at different
times in these cycles,

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.546 align:middle line:90%
things become unmanifest.

00:08:49.546 --> 00:08:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
manifested again.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.314 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so the good
news there-- for anybody

00:08:55.314 --> 00:08:56.730 align:middle line:84%
who thought the
world was supposed

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.360 align:middle line:84%
to have ended last month
on December 21, 2012--

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.990 align:middle line:84%
is that from the
Veda perspective,

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.550 align:middle line:84%
we are now only halfway
through the daytime cycle

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:84%
of the Day of the
Brahma, which means

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.710 align:middle line:84%
we have another couple billion
years where life flourishes

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and continues to
manifest on Earth.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: It's interesting
that you say that.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Earlier this year, I
was giving some lectures

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.900 align:middle line:90%
at universities in India.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of the questions I
was getting from students

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:32.280 align:middle line:84%
is is there going to
be doomsday in 2012?

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.430 align:middle line:84%
When I said earlier this
year, I mean earlier in 2012.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Earlier last
year, early in last year

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.930 align:middle line:84%
I was giving some lectures
at universities in India.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of
the common questions

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.290 align:middle line:90%
I was getting from students.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:51.172 align:middle line:84%
Because in India, they had
been playing this movie "2012"

00:09:51.172 --> 00:09:51.984 align:middle line:90%
on all--

00:09:51.984 --> 00:09:52.734 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, god.

00:09:52.734 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: --the cable channels.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's horrible.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: And there's
this one image

00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:00.485 align:middle line:84%
where this huge tidal wave
comes washing over India

00:10:00.485 --> 00:10:02.515 align:middle line:90%
up into the Himalayan Mountains.

00:10:02.515 --> 00:10:04.379 align:middle line:84%
And there's a monk
up there, you know--

00:10:04.379 --> 00:10:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is awful.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.526 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: --watching this
huge tidal wave coming.

00:10:08.526 --> 00:10:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You assured them
in your tradition, no.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:12.827 align:middle line:90%
We're fine--

00:10:12.827 --> 00:10:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yeah.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.356 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --for
another couple billion.

00:10:14.356 --> 00:10:15.772 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Yeah, so
you can register

00:10:15.772 --> 00:10:16.780 align:middle line:90%
for next year's classes.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You got 2 more
billion in the cycle.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yeah.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.633 align:middle line:90%
We've got some time.

00:10:19.633 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:84%
It's going to happen,
but not anytime soon.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.171 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:22.171 --> 00:10:24.274 align:middle line:90%
OK, now going back.

00:10:24.274 --> 00:10:25.940 align:middle line:84%
When we talked last
time, we were really

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:84%
setting a case of why
knowledge is filtered,

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.480 align:middle line:84%
and that there is a larger kind
of agenda that really feeds

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.910 align:middle line:84%
into a materialistic view of
life, which leads to ultimately

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:39.710 align:middle line:84%
consumerism, which has its
devastating consequences if we

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.630 align:middle line:84%
overconsume, which of
course we are doing.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.277 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm just trying
to put it in a nutshell.

00:10:44.277 --> 00:10:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Sure.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so when we
talked about your early past,

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.670 align:middle line:84%
you were of a mind that you
wanted to find evidence.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:58.250 align:middle line:84%
If you were reading these
ancient Vedic texts that

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.490 align:middle line:84%
were talking about
this extreme antiquity,

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:03.660 align:middle line:84%
your hypothesis is there
has to be evidence for it.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And so you set out to
find it, and you did.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And so in this
conversation, I'd really

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.240 align:middle line:84%
like to talk about the time in
which some of these discoveries

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:90%
were made.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:16.200 align:middle line:84%
This whole period of the
early 20th century, I mean,

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.670 align:middle line:84%
it was an explosion of
experimentation and discovery

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:20.470 align:middle line:90%
of all kinds.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:25.570 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to shut down
by mid-20th century.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Late 19th, early 20th
century, all kinds

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.370 align:middle line:84%
of things we being discovered
on a spiritual level

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:90%
and on a material level.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Yeah, you're
right about that.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.200 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the
archaeological evidence

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.780 align:middle line:84%
for extreme human antiquity
was being publicly reported

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:48.820 align:middle line:84%
by scientists in the late 19th
century and early 20th century.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.840 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And also, when we look at
alternative explanations

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:59.090 align:middle line:84%
for human origins that involve
some kind of spiritual element,

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.430 align:middle line:84%
we see that a lot of
prominent scientists

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.880 align:middle line:84%
were conducting research
into the paranormal

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.140 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think there were
a couple of reasons

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:84%
why that kind of research
stopped being publicly reported

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.010 align:middle line:90%
by prominent scientists.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And one reason is that, in terms
of the archaeological evidence

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.520 align:middle line:84%
for extreme human
antiquity, before that time,

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:37.640 align:middle line:84%
they really didn't have
their timeline totally fixed.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.810 align:middle line:84%
As a result of some
discoveries that

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:84%
were made in the
late 19th century,

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:48.100 align:middle line:84%
they fixed their timeline so
that they would have humans

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.500 align:middle line:84%
like us appearing
less than a couple

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.850 align:middle line:90%
hundred thousand years ago.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: And then, because
they had fixed their timeline

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:03.660 align:middle line:84%
in that way, then they dismissed
all these earlier discoveries

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:08.070 align:middle line:84%
that had shown human beings were
existing for far longer periods

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:13.340 align:middle line:84%
of time going back many
millions of years even.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
saying, well, if humans

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:20.080 align:middle line:84%
like us appeared less
than 200,000 years ago,

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:25.790 align:middle line:84%
then these other discoveries
couldn't possibly be true.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.290 align:middle line:90%
So let's forget about them.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.560 align:middle line:90%
And they were forgotten.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of the alternative
explanations of human origins

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:41.920 align:middle line:84%
that involve what we might
call paranormal elements,

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.220 align:middle line:84%
there were scientists who were
investigating these things,

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:50.260 align:middle line:84%
but they also stopped publicly
reporting these things

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.500 align:middle line:90%
in the early 20th century.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:14:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think there are
some reasons for this.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And one reason was that
governments and corporations

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.160 align:middle line:84%
started putting huge
amounts of money

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.400 align:middle line:84%
into science around the
time of World War I.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted results from
their investment in science.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.930 align:middle line:84%
They wanted very
specific things.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:90%
They wanted weapons.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.880 align:middle line:90%
They wanted pharmaceuticals.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.450 align:middle line:90%
They wanted consumer products.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And scientists
decided, well, if we

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:44.210 align:middle line:84%
want all this money,
billions of dollars,

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.230 align:middle line:84%
that corporations
and governments are

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:52.230 align:middle line:84%
prepared to give us,
we should kind of

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:58.125 align:middle line:84%
limit our scientific activity
to things that further those--

00:14:58.125 --> 00:14:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Economic agendas.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: --particular goals.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
they decided, well,

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.520 align:middle line:84%
all this paranormal
research and things

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:12.330 align:middle line:84%
of that, that isn't really
contributing to that.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:84%
So let's focus on the
strictly material things.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense,
that was productive

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:84%
because they did get a
lot of influence, because

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.290 align:middle line:84%
of the huge investments that
government and corporations

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:36.220 align:middle line:84%
made in science that
would give weapons,

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:84%
that would give
pharmaceuticals, that

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.400 align:middle line:90%
would give consumer products.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:90%
But there was a cost to that.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
still suffering

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:53.890 align:middle line:84%
the effects of that bargain
that was made at that time.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Because what we wind up with
is an incomplete picture

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:04.400 align:middle line:84%
of reality that leaves
out the spiritual element.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything
non-physical.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yeah.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Because of that, I think we've
got an environmental crisis.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:84%
We've got a financial
crisis, and we've

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:20.120 align:middle line:84%
got a political crisis in the
world, intensifying levels

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.010 align:middle line:84%
of conflict that just
don't seem to go away

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.751 align:middle line:90%
no matter how hard we try.

00:16:27.751 --> 00:16:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then, when you--

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's not only
that it seems like it

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.840 align:middle line:84%
was convenient to
be able to develop

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.270 align:middle line:90%
these industries and such.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:84%
But something more
aggressive happened.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.210 align:middle line:84%
It seems that anything that
wasn't able to be borne out

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:84%
in a materialistic
realm of science

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.780 align:middle line:84%
actually was subject to
ridicule from that point

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.040 align:middle line:90%
forward as well.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it wasn't
just that we need

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.100 align:middle line:90%
to focus on this for a while.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.130 align:middle line:84%
There was almost
a direct attempt

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:84%
to kill the other types
of research and science,

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.160 align:middle line:84%
where it just sort
of disappeared.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:84%
for decades, as
a matter of fact,

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.690 align:middle line:84%
till some of the scientists of
the more modern era from '70s

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.650 align:middle line:84%
forward started really
researching into it

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.477 align:middle line:90%
again at universities even.

00:17:06.477 --> 00:17:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yeah.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And not only did they
ridicule people at the time,

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:18.579 align:middle line:84%
but they rewrote the
whole history of science.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:23.579 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you look
in any physics textbook

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:29.600 align:middle line:84%
today, you'll see descriptions
of the work of Pierre and Marie

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Curie, who were
husband and wife.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:84%
They both got Nobel
Prizes for their work

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.440 align:middle line:84%
in discovering radium
and doing a lot

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:45.320 align:middle line:84%
of the early research
in radioactivity.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And you'll read about
that in the textbooks.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:52.330 align:middle line:84%
But what you won't read about
is the years of research

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:58.327 align:middle line:84%
they did with psychics,
people with paranormal powers.

00:17:58.327 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
that's real science,

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.970 align:middle line:84%
where you're willing to
look into all realms.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not just exclusive
to one or the other.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.499 align:middle line:84%
And they did this for quite
a long time, didn't they?

00:18:08.499 --> 00:18:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:14.850 align:middle line:84%
They did two years of research
with a medium, an Italian lady

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:90%
named Eusapia Palladino.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And this woman had some
psychokinetic abilities,

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:24.830 align:middle line:84%
mind over matter abilities,
that they wanted to test.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And they thought these ideas
were relevant to physics.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And they were part
of a group of 20

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.520 align:middle line:84%
prominent European
scientists who

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.130 align:middle line:84%
were conducting these
experiments with this medium

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:46.470 align:middle line:84%
in Paris early in
the 20th century.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And they got tremendous
results on one occasion.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.050 align:middle line:84%
They were sitting
with the medium

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:58.900 align:middle line:84%
in the laboratory of
the Psychology Institute

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.870 align:middle line:90%
in Paris in broad daylight.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And the medium was
sitting in a chair.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Marie Curie was
holding her hands.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Other scientists
were holding her feet

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.350 align:middle line:84%
making sure she
wasn't moving at all.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of the
lab, under what he described

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.830 align:middle line:84%
as perfect conditions
of observation,

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Pierre Curie said a large
table, like this one,

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:26.360 align:middle line:84%
was floating about 3
feet off the ground.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And he was measuring how
high it was floating,

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.880 align:middle line:90%
timing how long it was floating.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And after two years of
such results, you know,

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.630 align:middle line:84%
the entire group of
scientists signed

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:84%
documents saying these
things are absolutely true.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Pierre Curie wrote to some of
his prominent physicist friends

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and said, we have to take
these things into account

00:19:52.300 --> 00:20:01.110 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to have a
complete picture of reality.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:07.610 align:middle line:84%
But this sort of thing is absent
from the current textbooks

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:08.570 align:middle line:90%
of physics.

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:09.445 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:09.445 --> 00:20:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: You'll only find the
work they did with radium.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: And
therefore, people today

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:24.260 align:middle line:84%
get an incomplete picture of
what real science actually is.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.185 align:middle line:84%
When they hear
something like mediums,

00:20:26.185 --> 00:20:30.270 align:middle line:84%
psychokinetic abilities,
they would say,

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.640 align:middle line:84%
this is outside the
bounds of real science.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they were
using scientific techniques

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and protocols to prove these
things out now 100 years ago.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes, they were.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:48.925 align:middle line:10%
And I think that
is real science--

00:20:48.925 --> 00:20:49.590 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:53.390 align:middle line:10%
>>CREMO: --a science that takes
into account everything that's

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:10%
possibly true about the
world that we live in.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:21:00.930 align:middle line:10%
And you know, a few years
ago, I was giving a lecture

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:03.350 align:middle line:10%
at a university of Europe
in the country of Hungary.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:06.330 align:middle line:84%
It was their main
science university.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was speaking to
a group of physicists

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and graduate
students of physics.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was going through what
I call the hidden history

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:23.870 align:middle line:84%
of physics, the accounts
of great physicists,

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:32.210 align:middle line:84%
like the Curies, who had done
research in these fields that

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:36.270 align:middle line:84%
are now considered outside
the bounds of real physics

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.030 align:middle line:90%
or science.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering what
they were going to say.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So afterwards, one of the
physicists came up to me

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and said, you know, I'm glad
that you gave this talk.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.370 align:middle line:84%
By day, I'm doing
plasma physics,

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.350 align:middle line:84%
the physics of
superheated gases.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:02.010 align:middle line:84%
But he told me,
privately at night, I'm

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:05.060 align:middle line:84%
doing some experiments
in telepathy.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:09.660 align:middle line:90%
He told me, I have a son.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he's young.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.390 align:middle line:90%
And I put him in another room.

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I flip a
coin, and he's got

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.954 align:middle line:90%
to tell me whether it's heads--

00:22:16.954 --> 00:22:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I used to
do that with my son.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:18.920 align:middle line:90%
Tails.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: --or tails.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:20.335 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:20.335 --> 00:22:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: He said, my
son is getting 80%--

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.855 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:22.855 --> 00:22:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: --correct, which
is really unexpected.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kids are good, yeah.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: And he said,
I wouldn't tell this

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.240 align:middle line:84%
to any of my colleagues,
because they'd

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.750 align:middle line:84%
think I've gone off
the reservation.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:39.360 align:middle line:84%
But he felt safe in
speaking to me about it.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:45.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
I often encounter,

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes there're
scientists who, by day, appear

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.720 align:middle line:84%
completely orthodox,
but privately, they

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.236 align:middle line:90%
have other opinions.

00:22:57.236 --> 00:22:57.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, it makes sense.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.821 align:middle line:84%
If they have an inquiring
mind, why wouldn't they

00:22:59.821 --> 00:23:02.587 align:middle line:84%
want to know a larger
picture, really?

00:23:02.587 --> 00:23:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Sure.

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.714 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, this dates
back to Sir Isaac Newton.

00:23:05.714 --> 00:23:07.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people
think of him as sort

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.660 align:middle line:84%
of the godfather of the
materialist view of science.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.230 align:middle line:84%
However, that wasn't his
sole interest at all, was it?

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: No.

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:19.310 align:middle line:84%
He actually spent quite a bit
of time researching things

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.890 align:middle line:84%
like alchemy and other
paranormal topics.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote
extensively about them.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:29.850 align:middle line:84%
This is rarely mentioned
in physics textbooks.

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:31.990 align:middle line:84%
There are some
historians of science

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.790 align:middle line:90%
who have looked into this.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:39.070 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of
scientific discussion

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:45.100 align:middle line:84%
today, they ignore these aspects
of his work, which I think

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:45.904 align:middle line:90%
is unfortunate.

00:23:45.904 --> 00:23:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:47.944 align:middle line:84%
How long have they
been filtering

00:23:47.944 --> 00:23:50.599 align:middle line:90%
that part of his works out?

00:23:50.599 --> 00:23:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: I would
say the past-- well,

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.944 align:middle line:84%
of course he was living
during the 18th century.

00:23:55.944 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: So it's something that
started in earnest, I believe,

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.769 align:middle line:90%
in the 19th century--

00:24:06.769 --> 00:24:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: --and
early 20th century.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, we keep
going back to the same period.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Massive amounts of discoveries
just prior to that, and then

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:19.770 align:middle line:84%
a seeming quashing of
the evidence after that,

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:22.686 align:middle line:84%
following that, which
is the interesting.

00:24:22.686 --> 00:24:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And I know we did talk
about that in the last show.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.226 align:middle line:84%
What I would like to do also--
there were a couple others.

00:24:27.226 --> 00:24:30.270 align:middle line:84%
If you could get to
Sir Oliver Lodge?

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Sir Oliver Lodge was
a prominent British physicist

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:39.390 align:middle line:84%
who lived in the
early 20th century.

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:43.400 align:middle line:90%
And he had a son named Raymond.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And his son Raymond
died during World War I.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.080 align:middle line:90%
He was in the British military.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:54.470 align:middle line:90%
He was killed in Europe.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:25:03.970 align:middle line:84%
So after that, Lodge
tried to establish contact

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:07.570 align:middle line:90%
with the spirit of his son.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.980 align:middle line:90%
And he made use of a medium.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:15.800 align:middle line:90%
And he went in disguise.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't let the
medium know who he was.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And through the interactions
with this medium,

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:84%
he got communications
from a conscious entity

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.730 align:middle line:84%
that revealed things
that would only

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:84%
have been known to his
son, very intimate details

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:46.570 align:middle line:84%
about the family history and his
personal dealings with his son.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So what I find interesting is
that Lodge published a book

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:58.490 align:middle line:90%
about this whole case.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And in it, he dealt
with a lot of the types

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.220 align:middle line:84%
of skeptical
objections that might

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:09.310 align:middle line:84%
be made by some of his
scientific colleagues.

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:14.330 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a
really good example

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.320 align:middle line:84%
of a prominent
physicist who came

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:84%
to accept that
consciousness can survive

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.087 align:middle line:90%
the death of the physical body.

00:26:25.087 --> 00:26:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: And this is something
I'm absolutely convinced of--

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:28.763 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:28.763 --> 00:26:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: --that this body is
a vehicle for a conscious self

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:37.760 align:middle line:90%
that has a non-material source.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, this idea is not
very popular in the world

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.240 align:middle line:90%
of science today.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:47.280 align:middle line:84%
The most common idea today
in the world of science

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.480 align:middle line:84%
is that consciousness
is produced

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:55.680 align:middle line:84%
by the interaction of
chemicals within the brain.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Most cognitive or
neuroscientists

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:01.910 align:middle line:84%
would say if you organized
the molecules in the brain

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:04.560 align:middle line:84%
in a sufficiently
complex way, they'll

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.700 align:middle line:84%
generate consciousness,
but only temporarily

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.041 align:middle line:90%
and only in association with--

00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With
firings of the brain.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:13.714 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: --the firings-

00:27:13.714 --> 00:27:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: --of the
brain, which means

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.880 align:middle line:84%
ultimately there is
no conscious self

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:26.680 align:middle line:84%
that could survive the
demise of the physical body.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is interesting,
because it brings us

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:33.180 align:middle line:84%
into the subject of this
dual nature of ourselves,

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:84%
which you're saying in
your work is absolutely

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.100 align:middle line:84%
essential to being able to
piece together-- utilizing

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.410 align:middle line:84%
the non-physical aspect
of our intelligence

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:45.330 align:middle line:84%
is essential in piecing
together our ancient history.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.540 align:middle line:84%
You can't do it just
looking for bones alone.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.270 align:middle line:90%
That's not sufficient.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Absolutely.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, what the stones
and bones show us

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.554 align:middle line:84%
if we actually look at
all of the evidence--

00:27:59.554 --> 00:28:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: --is that
humans have been here

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:10.010 align:middle line:84%
since the very beginning
of life on Earth.

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:12.953 align:middle line:84%
When people read my book
"Forbidden Archeology,"--

00:28:12.953 --> 00:28:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.987 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: --they noticed that.

00:28:14.987 --> 00:28:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: And now
what that means is

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:23.510 align:middle line:84%
we need new explanations
for human origins.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So people would ask
me that question.

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:32.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, what is your explanation
of how we came about?

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And to answer that
question, I wrote

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.140 align:middle line:84%
a book called
"Human Devolution."

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And what I proposed
there was before we even

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:45.590 align:middle line:84%
ask the question where did
human beings come from,

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:50.950 align:middle line:84%
we should first of all ask the
question what is a human being?

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I was just saying
today, most scientists

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.910 align:middle line:84%
would say we're just
machines made of matter.

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And as far as mind and
consciousness are concerned,

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.780 align:middle line:84%
well, if you organize
matter in a very complex way

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:12.230 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, the brain will
produce mind and consciousness.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very materialistic
conception of who we are.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: But what
I'm proposing is

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:27.710 align:middle line:84%
that we're made of three things,
matter, the ordinary chemical

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:28.360 align:middle line:90%
elements.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.250 align:middle line:90%
That's part of what we are.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:35.860 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, there
is a subtle mind element

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:41.875 align:middle line:84%
with some very unusual
powers like remote viewing--

00:29:41.875 --> 00:29:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
everyone's capable of.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everyone.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: And we could
talk about that.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:47.173 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:47.173 --> 00:29:49.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: And beyond that
subtle mind element,

00:29:52.570 --> 00:30:00.860 align:middle line:84%
there is a conscious self
which is totally non-material.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I'm speaking about
mind and consciousness,

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:07.084 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean
temporary byproducts--

00:30:07.084 --> 00:30:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: --of brain chemistry.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:14.766 align:middle line:84%
I mean real things with their
own independent existence.

00:30:14.766 --> 00:30:15.953 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:15.953 --> 00:30:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Subtle bodies.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Right.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:22.330 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going to
explain where we came from,

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:26.010 align:middle line:84%
we have to explain, well,
where does that consciousness

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:27.250 align:middle line:90%
come from?

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Where does the matter come from?

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:33.670 align:middle line:84%
How do they all come
together in the human form

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:37.810 align:middle line:84%
as we experience
it on this Earth?

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm proposing is
that originally, we're

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:43.020 align:middle line:90%
beings of pure conscience.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.160 align:middle line:90%
That's what we are.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:49.570 align:middle line:84%
We originally exist in
harmony with all other beings

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:54.030 align:middle line:84%
of pure consciousness and the
source of all conscious beings.

00:30:54.030 --> 00:31:02.150 align:middle line:84%
But if a conscious self
leaves that original state,

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:08.250 align:middle line:84%
then it becomes
associated with matter.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:12.150 align:middle line:84%
It comes down into
lower levels of reality.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:15.160 align:middle line:90%
And why is that?

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because that original
level of pure consciousness

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:22.880 align:middle line:84%
is based on love,
unselfish love.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.295 align:middle line:84%
If a conscious self becomes
exploitative or selfish,

00:31:27.295 --> 00:31:31.580 align:middle line:84%
it could no longer
exist in that harmony.

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:34.335 align:middle line:84%
It needs a field
of activities where

00:31:34.335 --> 00:31:41.390 align:middle line:84%
it can act out its desires to
control, dominate, and exploit

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:43.320 align:middle line:90%
matter and others.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In these denser
physical frequencies

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:46.240 align:middle line:90%
or realities.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:48.880 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And for that purpose,
it needs a vehicle.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And there are different
kinds of vehicles.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.560 align:middle line:90%
There are human vehicles.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.290 align:middle line:90%
They are plant vehicles.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:02.010 align:middle line:90%
There are animal vehicles.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:06.560 align:middle line:84%
According to the state
of consciousness,

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:11.040 align:middle line:84%
it is placed in a
certain vehicle.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And where do those
vehicles come from?

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.912 align:middle line:84%
Well, it comes from higher
intelligences in the cosmos.

00:32:15.912 --> 00:32:17.370 align:middle line:10%
>>CREMO: And it's
worth bringing up

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:19.930 align:middle line:10%
at this point, I think, the
point, because it struck me

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:23.290 align:middle line:10%
in your book, that the
co-founder of the theory

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.120 align:middle line:10%
of evolution with
Darwin-- I mean,

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.450 align:middle line:10%
the way it was ultimately
played out politically,

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:31.710 align:middle line:10%
Wallace-- actually
came to believe

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.030 align:middle line:10%
there is an evolution of sorts.

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:35.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's guided by a
higher intelligence, which

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.400 align:middle line:84%
has come to be, as we were
saying off camera, kind

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.960 align:middle line:84%
of a fusion between
science and religion,

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.309 align:middle line:84%
so that it can live peacefully
together at this point in time.

00:32:43.309 --> 00:32:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:48.105 align:middle line:84%
I think Wallace was an
excellent example of that.

00:32:48.105 --> 00:32:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: He was
able to integrate

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:53.390 align:middle line:84%
his spirituality
and his science.

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And the result is a more
complete and better science.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.436 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:00.436 --> 00:33:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And right now,
they're saying, well,

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.100 align:middle line:90%
show me the physical evidence.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:07.150 align:middle line:84%
So along that line, we
have a few little pieces

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:08.400 align:middle line:90%
that we can talk about.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I just took a few
excerpts from your book

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.930 align:middle line:84%
just to drive home the point
that these bones exist.

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:16.140 align:middle line:90%
This isn't theory.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.860 align:middle line:84%
One of them I found
intriguing, because it's not

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:22.620 align:middle line:84%
far from where I live actually,
is in the California Gold Rush

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.930 align:middle line:84%
territory, Table Mountain,
that particular discovery.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:29.070 align:middle line:84%
If you could talk about that a
bit, because that's quite old.

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:33.740 align:middle line:10%
>>CREMO: That is a
really fascinating case.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.535 align:middle line:10%
As I say, my work starts
with the stones and bones.

00:33:36.535 --> 00:33:37.160 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.485 align:middle line:10%
>>CREMO: But from there,
it goes on to other things.

00:33:39.485 --> 00:33:40.360 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: But an
important first step--

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:43.178 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So in the trenches.

00:33:43.178 --> 00:33:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: --in getting there from
the scientific point of view

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.390 align:middle line:84%
is showing there
is evidence that

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:52.150 align:middle line:84%
contradicts the current
theories of human origins.

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the mid-19th
century, gold

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.470 align:middle line:90%
was discovered in California.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And to get the gold,
miners came to places

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:05.237 align:middle line:84%
like Table Mountain,
which is near Sonora in--

00:34:05.237 --> 00:34:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tuolumne County.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.929 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: --Tuolumne County in
the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And they were digging tunnels
into the sides of that mountain

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:15.560 align:middle line:90%
to get the gold.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And deep inside the
tunnels in the solid rock,

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:24.489 align:middle line:84%
the miners found human
bones and human artifacts.

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:27.949 align:middle line:84%
They found stone
mortars and pestles.

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:30.429 align:middle line:84%
They found obsidian
spear points.

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:33.780 align:middle line:84%
They found human
bones and teeth.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:40.449 align:middle line:84%
These objects were collected
by Dr. J.D. Whitney, who

00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:44.800 align:middle line:84%
was the chief government
geologist of California.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Mount Whitney is
named after him.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:50.110 align:middle line:84%
He was a very
prominent scientist.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And he reported
these discoveries

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:55.690 align:middle line:90%
to the scientific world.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, what makes them
really significant

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:02.450 align:middle line:84%
is they're found in
layers of solid rock

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:10.750 align:middle line:84%
that modern geologists tell us
are about 50 million years old,

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:12.730 align:middle line:84%
which is really
quite extraordinary

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:18.270 align:middle line:84%
because the dominant idea today
is that humans like us came

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:22.610 align:middle line:84%
into existence less
than 200,000 years ago.

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:26.730 align:middle line:84%
So to have this evidence
showing that humans

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:31.810 align:middle line:84%
like us were present
50 million years ago

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:33.864 align:middle line:90%
is really quite astonishing.

00:35:33.864 --> 00:35:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're still looking
for Native American Indian

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:40.390 align:middle line:84%
arrowheads as evidence of
our antiquity from a couple

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:42.367 align:middle line:90%
hundred years ago.

00:35:42.367 --> 00:35:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yeah.

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And this discovery, as
announced by Dr. Whitney,

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:52.230 align:middle line:90%
created some controversy.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And the scientific
community basically

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.760 align:middle line:90%
rejected the discoveries.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
why they rejected it.

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:07.060 align:middle line:84%
There was an anthropologist
named William Holmes, who

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:14.540 align:middle line:84%
worked at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington DC.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote in
one of his reports,

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:23.800 align:middle line:84%
if Dr. Whitney had understood
the theory of human evolution,

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.910 align:middle line:84%
he wouldn't have come
to those conclusions.

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And in other words,
if the facts didn't

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:34.760 align:middle line:84%
support the theory of
evolution with its ideas

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:38.230 align:middle line:84%
of a recent origin
for the human species,

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:40.390 align:middle line:84%
he shouldn't have
published that report.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:45.330 align:middle line:84%
He should've known these things
could not possibly be true.

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, many people think that the
way scientists should operate

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:55.770 align:middle line:84%
is that if facts are discovered
that contradict a theory,

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:59.580 align:middle line:84%
the theory should be modified
to accommodate the facts.

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:03.780 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the way
that it always works.

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, it
most certainly wasn't.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So according to Holmes,
these discoveries

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.679 align:middle line:90%
should not have been reported.

00:37:13.679 --> 00:37:14.345 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:14.345 --> 00:37:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: They should have
simply been forgotten.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
that's what happened.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Now Whitney, he
published this report.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:27.190 align:middle line:84%
It was published by Harvard
University in the year in 1880.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:31.930 align:middle line:84%
But we don't read about
these things in the textbooks

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:39.130 align:middle line:84%
today, because of what I call a
process of knowledge filtration

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:42.510 align:middle line:84%
that operates in the
world of science.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of those
artifacts are still

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.850 align:middle line:84%
in the collection of the
Museum of Anthropology

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:53.740 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
California at Berkeley.

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:54.980 align:middle line:90%
And I've been there.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.660 align:middle line:90%
I've seen them.

00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:00.760 align:middle line:84%
But the average person
who goes to the museum

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.230 align:middle line:84%
would not suspect that
those things are there.

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:06.380 align:middle line:90%
They're not shown to the public.

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:10.810 align:middle line:84%
The average person would have
no idea that they're there.

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what about-- there
was also something in Kentucky

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.081 align:middle line:84%
that harks back to about
300 million years ago.

00:38:16.081 --> 00:38:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's the same as
what we talked about earlier.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't it human
footprints they found?

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:27.710 align:middle line:84%
There was a scientist
working in Kentucky

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:33.560 align:middle line:84%
in the 1930s and
1940s who reported

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:39.270 align:middle line:84%
the existence of
human footprints

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:46.440 align:middle line:84%
in sedimentary formations
about 300 million years old

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.030 align:middle line:90%
in Kentucky.

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of the
skeptics said, well,

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.570 align:middle line:84%
these must've been carved
into the rock somehow.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:56.920 align:middle line:84%
But he did detailed
studies, and he

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:04.010 align:middle line:84%
showed that-- he did
microphotographic studies that

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:10.010 align:middle line:84%
examined the grains
of sand in this rock.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And it showed that
there was compression.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.120 align:middle line:84%
In other words, that
the grains of sand

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:20.240 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of the footprints
were compressed together more

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:26.340 align:middle line:84%
than the grains
of sand at the top

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.280 align:middle line:84%
of the sides of the
footprint, which

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.064 align:middle line:84%
indicated they were
made by pressure--

00:39:30.064 --> 00:39:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: --not by
carving into the rock.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, some-- one of the
skeptical scientists

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:40.510 align:middle line:84%
reported in a
scientific journal.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:45.460 align:middle line:84%
It says, if this
is true, then we

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:48.200 align:middle line:84%
should give up our
professions as scientists

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.255 align:middle line:84%
and all take jobs
as truck drivers.

00:39:50.255 --> 00:39:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, sometimes that
might've been a good idea.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yeah.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:55.730 align:middle line:90%
It might have been.

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:59.290 align:middle line:84%
But yes, that's another case
of archaeological evidence

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:00.930 align:middle line:90%
for extreme human antiquity.

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And here, we're looking at that
300 million year mark again,

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:07.730 align:middle line:84%
same as the two instances
we talked about earlier on.

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's do the reverse of what I
asked you the first time, which

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:13.130 align:middle line:84%
is what was the modern
scientific view of what

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:15.380 align:middle line:84%
was happening on the Earth
300 million years ago.

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:16.680 align:middle line:90%
Now, you already answered that.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's look at what was
happening 300 million years ago

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:23.600 align:middle line:84%
if you go back to the
kalpa or the yuga cycles?

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:29.634 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well, according
to the Vedic cosmology,

00:40:29.634 --> 00:40:37.230 align:middle line:84%
the kalpa is divided into
sub-cycles called Manvantara

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:39.300 align:middle line:90%
periods.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And according to the Veda
cosmological calendar,

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:49.290 align:middle line:84%
we are now in the middle
of the seventh Manvantara

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:53.270 align:middle line:84%
period of the
current kalpa, which

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:56.880 align:middle line:90%
began about 2 billion years ago.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.810 align:middle line:84%
So according to the
Vedic cosmology,

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:05.130 align:middle line:84%
after each Manvantara,
there is a devastation

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:11.370 align:middle line:84%
after which the Earth
has to be repopulated.

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:18.010 align:middle line:84%
So that would mean if we're
in the seventh Manvantara now,

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:23.730 align:middle line:84%
then that means there have
been six devastations spaced

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:27.530 align:middle line:84%
at intervals of about
300 million years--

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: --in the current
kalpa or Day of Brahma.

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's interesting
that according

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:39.800 align:middle line:84%
to modern paleontology, there
have been six major extinction

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:45.490 align:middle line:84%
events in the history of life
on Earth spaced at intervals

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:48.540 align:middle line:84%
of several hundred million
years, the last one being

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.083 align:middle line:84%
the one that wiped
out the dinosaurs.

00:41:50.083 --> 00:41:52.864 align:middle line:90%


00:41:52.864 --> 00:41:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: 300 million
years ago would

00:41:56.210 --> 00:42:00.950 align:middle line:84%
be in the middle of the
sixth Manvantara period

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:04.410 align:middle line:84%
according to the Vedic
cosmological calendar.

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And according to the Puranas,
the Vedic historical text,

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:14.360 align:middle line:84%
there were humans
existing on Earth

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.800 align:middle line:84%
during the sixth
Manvantara period

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.696 align:middle line:84%
and the fifth and the fourth
and the third of the first even.

00:42:19.696 --> 00:42:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is now
taking us back billions

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and billions and
billions of years.

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Hundreds of
millions of years.

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Hundreds of
millions of years.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And even billions.

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:27.723 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yeah.

00:42:27.723 --> 00:42:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And here we go.

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:32.800 align:middle line:84%
So the other number
that keeps coming up--

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.300 align:middle line:84%
and I saw this repeatedly, I've
only pulled one example of it,

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:40.310 align:middle line:84%
the Moulin Quignon jaw,
but it came up repeatedly

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:44.960 align:middle line:84%
in your book-- was a period
of roughly 400,000 years ago.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.800 align:middle line:84%
It seems like a
lot of discoveries

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:50.960 align:middle line:84%
have taken place that have
unearthed remnants of humans

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.807 align:middle line:90%
from 400,000 years ago as well.

00:42:53.807 --> 00:42:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Absolutely.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:58.700 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of discoveries
that date back to that period

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:02.580 align:middle line:84%
between 300,00 and
400,000 years ago.

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.050 align:middle line:84%
The Moulin Quignon
jaw is one of them.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:07.890 align:middle line:84%
That was a discovery
that was made

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:12.340 align:middle line:84%
in the 19th century
in France by one

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:18.370 align:middle line:84%
of the founders of modern
archaeology, Jacques Boucher de

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:19.970 align:middle line:90%
Perthes.

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And he had been
conducting excavations

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:28.930 align:middle line:84%
in the Somme River Valley
in Northeastern France.

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And at this place,
Moulin Quignon,

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:38.350 align:middle line:84%
he uncovered an anatomically
modern human jaw in a formation

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:46.900 align:middle line:84%
that modern geologists tell
us is over 400,000 years old.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the same
formation, he also

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:53.450 align:middle line:84%
found many stone
tools and weapons.

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:57.560 align:middle line:84%
But many scientists
of that time could not

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:04.740 align:middle line:84%
accept that humans existed
so far in the past.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.340 align:middle line:90%
So what they proposed was this.

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Somebody must have gone
to some Roman cemetery

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:17.750 align:middle line:84%
and taken a human jawbone
maybe 2,000 years old,

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:22.500 align:middle line:84%
and then planted it in the
excavation for Boucher de

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.200 align:middle line:90%
Perthes to find.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that's the
explanation for this discovery

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:30.530 align:middle line:84%
that you see in the
modern textbooks.

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:35.420 align:middle line:84%
What you don't see in
the modern textbooks

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:39.760 align:middle line:84%
is that after he heard
these accusations,

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Boucher de Perthes made
additional excavations

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:49.100 align:middle line:84%
into the same formations under
conditions that completely

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:54.240 align:middle line:90%
ruled out this hoax hypothesis.

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.840 align:middle line:84%
The new excavations
were witnessed

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.550 align:middle line:84%
by other professionals,
scientists.

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And in these new
excavations, he excavated

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:09.970 align:middle line:84%
100 additional anatomically
modern human bones and teeth

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:12.380 align:middle line:90%
from the same formations.

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think they
verify the reality

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:19.150 align:middle line:84%
of the original discovery
of the human jaw he

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:21.240 align:middle line:90%
found in those formations.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a discovery
from the 19th century.

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people
might wonder, well,

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:31.140 align:middle line:84%
what about the 20th
century, more recent times.

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:34.500 align:middle line:84%
There have been discoveries
from that same period,

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.780 align:middle line:84%
between 300,000
and 400,000 years,

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:39.780 align:middle line:90%
from more modern scientists.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.020 align:middle line:10%
Virginia Steen-McIntyre,
for example,

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:44.650 align:middle line:10%
is an American geologist.

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:48.650 align:middle line:10%
She was called down
to Mexico to date

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:53.580 align:middle line:10%
an archaeological site at
a place called Hueyatlaco.

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Some American
archaeologists there

00:45:55.890 --> 00:46:00.810 align:middle line:84%
had uncovered human artifacts,
stone tools and weapons.

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
know how old they were.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:07.220 align:middle line:84%
So Virginia Steen-McIntyre
and her colleagues

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.390 align:middle line:90%
went to that place.

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And they used four scientific
methods to date the site.

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And they concluded the
site must be at least

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:24.990 align:middle line:90%
250,000 or 300,000 years old.

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But the archaeologists
couldn't accept that.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:33.280 align:middle line:84%
They said human beings capable
of making these things did not

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:38.130 align:middle line:84%
exist anywhere in the world
at that period of time,

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:42.650 align:middle line:84%
and what to speak of being
present in North America.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:45.980 align:middle line:84%
The current scientific
idea is that there

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:47.990 align:middle line:84%
are no human beings
in North America

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:52.210 align:middle line:84%
any earlier than about
20,000 years ago.

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:53.585 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And here
you're finding

00:46:53.585 --> 00:46:55.270 align:middle line:90%
evidence 300 million years old.

00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: No, no.

00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:57.250 align:middle line:90%
This is 300,000.

00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:59.902 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, but I'm
saying earlier we were talking.

00:46:59.902 --> 00:47:00.860 align:middle line:90%
And a couple of those--

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Oh, the earlier ones.

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sure.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:01.600 align:middle line:90%
50 million--

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --all the way-- yeah.

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: 300 million.

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:03.095 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:03.095 --> 00:47:03.932 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Oh, sure.

00:47:03.932 --> 00:47:05.890 align:middle line:84%
There's hundreds of
discoveries of this nature.

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:08.181 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But again, it seems
that the world of science

00:47:08.181 --> 00:47:10.140 align:middle line:84%
refuses to allow that
to filter through.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And are you saying that even
today, the Moulin Quignon jaw

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:16.790 align:middle line:84%
is still being posed as a
hoax if you were to search it?

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:20.810 align:middle line:84%
If you search the
textbooks of archaeology--

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: --today yes.

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:23.937 align:middle line:84%
It's still being
proposed as a hoax.

00:47:23.937 --> 00:47:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even though
he offered another 100

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:27.380 align:middle line:90%
pieces of evidence plus?

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Yeah, that
part of the story

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:33.577 align:middle line:84%
is omitted from the textbook
accounts in most cases.

00:47:33.577 --> 00:47:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One thing you bring
up in your book about this

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:38.410 align:middle line:84%
is people may
object saying, well,

00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:42.200 align:middle line:84%
how can we take anything
seriously from 150 years ago?

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:45.520 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have the technology
we have today for analysis.

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And you bring up a
very interesting point.

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Well, you could look.

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Darwin's theory comes
from over 150 years ago.

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Newton and his laws of physics
come from further back in time

00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:58.230 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:47:58.230 --> 00:48:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Einstein's theory
of relativity was

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:05.110 align:middle line:84%
proposed well over
100 years ago.

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:08.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't just
say that all science done

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:17.027 align:middle line:84%
before midnight January
1, 1900 is bad science.

00:48:17.027 --> 00:48:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it would
have to play both ways.

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:20.026 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: That's right.

00:48:20.026 --> 00:48:22.350 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
reject all science done

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:25.080 align:middle line:84%
before any particular
date, then you

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:29.144 align:middle line:84%
can't just reject the
discoveries that go against--

00:48:29.144 --> 00:48:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: --what you
now think is true.

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:35.550 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
evenhanded in applying

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:37.195 align:middle line:90%
such a standard like that.

00:48:37.195 --> 00:48:38.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: So I think it's
a very bad argument.

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I'm sure
people watching this

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:46.280 align:middle line:84%
are thinking, yeah,
but they didn't

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:47.500 align:middle line:90%
have the instrumentation.

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's a valid one to bring
up if you're trying to--

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well, that's
one reason why I always

00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:58.050 align:middle line:84%
refer to the modern
geological reports of the ages

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:02.100 align:middle line:84%
of the formations in which
these objects are found.

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.520 align:middle line:90%
Because I think it is important.

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: And that
can't be overlooked.

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very happy that any of
these cases from the earlier

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:15.940 align:middle line:84%
history of archaeology
be reexamined

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:18.070 align:middle line:90%
according to modern techniques.

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Technology
of today, yeah.

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: But I don't think--

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Although that should
and could be done,

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:29.312 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we
can automatically--

00:49:29.312 --> 00:49:30.186 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Invalidate.

00:49:30.186 --> 00:49:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: --dismiss reports.

00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:31.215 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:31.215 --> 00:49:31.714 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:49:31.714 --> 00:49:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Because if you
look at any textbook

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:38.590 align:middle line:84%
of archaeology today,
it includes discoveries

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:42.360 align:middle line:84%
that were made in the
same period of time.

00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, the first
Neanderthal discovery

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:49.960 align:middle line:84%
was made in the
1850s in Germany.

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:58.060 align:middle line:84%
The first Homo erectus discovery
was made in the 1890s in Java.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:02.485 align:middle line:84%
The first Neanderthal
discoveries-- oh, I already

00:50:02.485 --> 00:50:03.110 align:middle line:90%
mentioned that.

00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
mentioned that one.

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: They were made
in Germany in the 1850s.

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And the first
Australopithecus discoveries

00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:13.530 align:middle line:84%
were made in South Africa
early in the 20th century.

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So every current
textbook of archaeology

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:20.440 align:middle line:84%
is full of discoveries
that were made

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.064 align:middle line:90%
from the same period of time.

00:50:22.064 --> 00:50:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:24.105 align:middle line:84%
I just brought
that up, because I

00:50:24.105 --> 00:50:26.860 align:middle line:84%
thought if anybody's
wondering the same,

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:28.900 align:middle line:84%
you have a beautiful
answer for it.

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:30.809 align:middle line:84%
Now, we only have
about five or six

00:50:30.809 --> 00:50:32.225 align:middle line:84%
minutes left in
this conversation.

00:50:32.225 --> 00:50:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get
into the modern use.

00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:38.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've already
looked at the Vedic texts

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and starting to peg
certain periods of history

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.530 align:middle line:84%
to some of the findings that
have happened in archaeology.

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, the whole subject of using
psychic phenomena-- as people

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:51.600 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to
awaken and accept

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:55.080 align:middle line:84%
this aspect of themselves, this
is being used more and more

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:58.790 align:middle line:84%
to start sussing out what
the condition of life was

00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:03.050 align:middle line:84%
and where bones are and what
kind of beings in society

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:04.740 align:middle line:90%
existed at that time.

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:06.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's gaining more credence.

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And you told me off
camera about a woman

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:11.550 align:middle line:90%
who is an archaeologist.

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:12.940 align:middle line:90%
She's very psychic.

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:16.755 align:middle line:84%
And she could start seeing the
complexity around the bones.

00:51:16.755 --> 00:51:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And can you talk about
that for a little bit,

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and its place in the field of
discovery today and science?

00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: It's a
very good question.

00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:30.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm just back from a meeting
of the World Archaeological

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Congress that was held on
the Dead Sea in Jordan.

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of
the world's largest

00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:43.190 align:middle line:84%
international organizations
of archaeologists.

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:47.880 align:middle line:84%
They meet every four years
in a different country.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:52.380 align:middle line:84%
So at this most recent
meeting, I presented a paper.

00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And I chose to present
a paper about how

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:59.650 align:middle line:84%
a prominent
scientist, John Talbot

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Robinson, famous for his
discoveries of the ape man

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Australopithecus
in South Africa,

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:15.400 align:middle line:84%
used a theosophist
psychic in his work

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:22.540 align:middle line:84%
at the Sterkfontein cave
site in South Africa.

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:24.260 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting what happened.

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:27.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, he had
met this psychic

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:32.240 align:middle line:90%
through a contact of his.

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And he thought he might be
helpful for his research.

00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So he brought him to
the Sterkfontein caves.

00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And this man laid down there
and went into a yogic trance.

00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And Robinson would put a
fossil on his forehead,

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:57.370 align:middle line:84%
for example, a tooth
of Australopithecus.

00:52:57.370 --> 00:53:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And this psychic,
this clairvoyant,

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:07.430 align:middle line:84%
would be able to see the
whole creature and what

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:11.270 align:middle line:84%
it was doing millions
of years ago.

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And there were five sessions
like this that took place

00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:18.420 align:middle line:84%
on separate days
on different days

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:23.030 align:middle line:84%
in the Sterkfontein caves
involving dozens of fossils

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:27.150 align:middle line:84%
of many different
species of ape men.

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to
report correctly

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:39.410 align:middle line:84%
the anatomical details of these
creatures and their behavior.

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And it helped Robinson
and his research.

00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So I thought it was
important for archaeologists

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:54.980 align:middle line:84%
to understand that there are
different ways for getting

00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:57.620 align:middle line:90%
knowledge of the past.

00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:01.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one way is
to just take a fossil

00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and study it with different
radiometric dating methods

00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:10.010 align:middle line:84%
and chemical techniques
and physical measurements.

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:13.920 align:middle line:84%
But I thought it was interesting
that a very prominent person,

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:18.690 align:middle line:84%
a very prominent
scientist, had expanded

00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:24.340 align:middle line:84%
his way of doing things
to include a psychic.

00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
it's totally valid.

00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: And there are
other archaeologists

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.770 align:middle line:90%
who have also done that.

00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:33.330 align:middle line:84%
There was an
archaeologist in England

00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:39.230 align:middle line:84%
early in the 20th century
named Frederick Bligh Bond.

00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:44.590 align:middle line:84%
He was excavating the
Glastonbury Cathedral

00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:47.280 align:middle line:90%
in Glastonbury, England.

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:51.860 align:middle line:84%
It had been destroyed during
the reign of King Henry

00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:57.410 align:middle line:84%
VIII in England
hundreds of years ago.

00:54:57.410 --> 00:55:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And he employed a psychic
who had the ability

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.390 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
past intelligences

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:08.874 align:middle line:84%
by a technique called
automatic writing.

00:55:08.874 --> 00:55:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:11.331 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: In other words,
he could establish

00:55:11.331 --> 00:55:13.190 align:middle line:84%
some kind of link
between his consciousness

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:16.910 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness of
these departed personalities.

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:17.417 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:55:17.417 --> 00:55:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Write out--

00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: --record--

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.011 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --what he was seeing.

00:55:20.011 --> 00:55:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: --write out
what they were seeing.

00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And it revealed the location
of an unknown chapel that

00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:32.710 align:middle line:84%
was part of that
cathedral complex.

00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And Frederick Bligh Bond
used this information

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.250 align:middle line:90%
to guide his excavations.

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:42.426 align:middle line:84%
And he confirmed
that it existed.

00:55:42.426 --> 00:55:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: And there are
other archaeologists

00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:49.126 align:middle line:84%
who've also employed these
psychic techniques as well.

00:55:49.126 --> 00:55:50.292 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which makes sense.

00:55:50.292 --> 00:55:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're waking up as
a species by the day.

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:54.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our faculties
are opening up.

00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Many more people are
having these kind

00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:59.260 align:middle line:84%
of precognizant experiences
and many others.

00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:02.380 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense to use
that vast consciousness that

00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:05.210 align:middle line:84%
precedes physicality that
you were talking about

00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:07.580 align:middle line:90%
to piece together who we are.

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And on that note, we're
just about out of time.

00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you so much
for the immense amount of work

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:15.950 align:middle line:84%
you've done to help
bring it to our awareness

00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:18.490 align:middle line:84%
that it's legitimate to
start raising these topics

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:20.705 align:middle line:90%
and having this discussion now.

00:56:20.705 --> 00:56:21.580 align:middle line:90%
Really appreciate it.

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:22.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Michael.

00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:23.786 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Thank you.

00:56:23.786 --> 00:56:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you
have not already

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.820 align:middle line:84%
viewed our first conversation,
you may want to do that.

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:29.360 align:middle line:10%
It gives a radically
different view

00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:32.420 align:middle line:10%
of how science should be used
alongside ancient religious

00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:34.930 align:middle line:10%
doctrine in piecing
together our distant past.

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:36.444 align:middle line:10%
It's highly intriguing.

00:56:36.444 --> 00:56:38.360 align:middle line:10%
