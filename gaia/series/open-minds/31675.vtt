>> Regina Meredith: Millions
of dollars a year are spent

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.992 align:middle line:84%
on readings with psychics
and readers of all stripes,

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:27.795 align:middle line:84%
yet according to Paul O'Brien
we all have the ability

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:30.564 align:middle line:84%
to access information
from the unseen realms.

00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:33.667 align:middle line:84%
The most direct path is through
the use of divination tools.

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:37.204 align:middle line:84%
This includes astrology,
numerology, tarot, I Ching,

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:40.474 align:middle line:84%
and other methods of accessing
unconscious information,

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:43.677 align:middle line:84%
often being directed
by our spirit or soul.

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:45.412 align:middle line:84%
Paul was so intrigued
with divination

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:48.115 align:middle line:84%
that he began exploring its
interface with technology

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:51.652 align:middle line:84%
and became the father of
interactive divination.

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Oh boy, in a big way.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.558 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's heard of
Tarot.com, you're the daddy.

00:00:57.558 --> 00:01:00.861 align:middle line:84%
>> Paul O'Brien: Well, it all
started with I Ching software

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:04.731 align:middle line:84%
and ended being, coming the
largest astrology website.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.834 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah,
I think most, probably most

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:11.172 align:middle line:84%
of our viewers, even back
to AOL when you were dealing

00:01:11.172 --> 00:01:14.441 align:middle line:84%
with Rick Levine, who
is a friend of yours,

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:17.711 align:middle line:84%
and his astrology and other
tools were all made available

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis on AOL.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.683 align:middle line:84%
And you were really instrumental
in that partnership.

00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:23.516 align:middle line:90%
>> Paul O'Brien: Right.

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.052 align:middle line:90%
AOL was one of our big partners.

00:01:25.052 --> 00:01:28.222 align:middle line:84%
We also partnered with
Google and MySpace,

00:01:28.222 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:84%
and it basically led to
millions of people having access

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.161 align:middle line:90%
to these authentic forms

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:37.298 align:middle line:84%
of classical divination
via the internet.

00:01:37.298 --> 00:01:38.966 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: I know,
which is amazing because,

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.968 align:middle line:84%
now if I hadn't known of
this and I were listening

00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:45.673 align:middle line:84%
for the first time, I would
say, "How is that possible?

00:01:45.673 --> 00:01:48.242 align:middle line:84%
" And we're going to get into
it, because this whole thing

00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:52.246 align:middle line:84%
about the human field and
technology interfacing

00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:54.181 align:middle line:84%
with each other, I think
a lot of people would say,

00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:55.482 align:middle line:90%
"Oh how can it possibly work?"

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:58.686 align:middle line:84%
But I've played with this
app that you've created,

00:01:58.686 --> 00:02:00.421 align:middle line:84%
the I Ching app,
and it does work,

00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:02.223 align:middle line:84%
and we'll show that
in a little bit.

00:02:02.223 --> 00:02:04.592 align:middle line:84%
First of all I thought we'd
just start with a primer course

00:02:04.592 --> 00:02:06.927 align:middle line:84%
on divination in
this conversation.

00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:10.664 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what divination is.

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:16.804 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Well, divination is a way
of stimulating the intuition

00:02:16.804 --> 00:02:20.341 align:middle line:84%
to think about problems that
logic can't handle or to deal

00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:22.877 align:middle line:84%
with questions that go
beyond the realm of logic

00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:26.647 align:middle line:84%
to help us think
outside the box.

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:28.749 align:middle line:90%
And this can take various forms.

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:32.253 align:middle line:84%
So the technology
that you use in order

00:02:32.253 --> 00:02:35.556 align:middle line:84%
to deliver a divination
experience is secondary

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:37.358 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that
what you're trying

00:02:37.358 --> 00:02:41.729 align:middle line:84%
to do is stimulate the intuition
using archetypes in order

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:45.332 align:middle line:84%
to answer questions
that logic can't handle.

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:48.202 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And it's not like
this is a new phenomenon.

00:02:48.202 --> 00:02:51.705 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little bit about
some of the original forms of --

00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:53.374 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've heard
of water witches

00:02:53.374 --> 00:03:00.447 align:middle line:84%
and even my father hired a
dousing expert to find his well

00:03:00.447 --> 00:03:02.983 align:middle line:84%
on his property, which they
found the first time out.

00:03:02.983 --> 00:03:04.685 align:middle line:84%
I didn't find that
out for many years,

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:06.287 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't think he
believed in any of that.

00:03:06.287 --> 00:03:08.889 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking to him about
dousing one day and he said,

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.824 align:middle line:84%
"Well, that's how we found
water on the property.

00:03:10.824 --> 00:03:14.361 align:middle line:84%
So this is probably the
most commonly-known one,

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:16.930 align:middle line:84%
but throughout the
ages how did it start?

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.500 align:middle line:84%
What were the tools,
and what were the uses?

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.636 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Well, I don't know a
whole lot about divining rods,

00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:25.572 align:middle line:84%
and finding water
with divining rods,

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:29.243 align:middle line:84%
but divination systems have been
around for thousands of years.

00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:31.045 align:middle line:90%
It goes back a long time.

00:03:31.045 --> 00:03:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Probably the oldest system,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.316 align:middle line:84%
and that's all I'm
really conversant with,

00:03:35.316 --> 00:03:37.584 align:middle line:90%
are the classical systems.

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:39.420 align:middle line:84%
The oldest system is the
I Ching, and that's been

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.921 align:middle line:84%
around three or four
thousand years.

00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:43.457 align:middle line:84%
We're not exactly
sure how old that is.

00:03:43.457 --> 00:03:46.894 align:middle line:84%
Tarot cards have been around
a thousand years perhaps,

00:03:46.894 --> 00:03:49.630 align:middle line:84%
used for divination
maybe 500 years.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.799 align:middle line:84%
Runes have been around
for a thousand years,

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.903 align:middle line:84%
maybe used for divination
for a few hundred years.

00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:59.506 align:middle line:84%
And astrology, of course, nobody
knows how old astrology is.

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:05.145 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to the Middle East,
to the Chaldean Sumerian Empires

00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:08.082 align:middle line:90%
that almost predate history.

00:04:08.082 --> 00:04:13.387 align:middle line:84%
So we've been looking for ways
to read the signs and omens

00:04:13.387 --> 00:04:17.391 align:middle line:84%
of nature and of the
times for a long time,

00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:19.526 align:middle line:84%
because we've had
this need to try

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:84%
to understand how
things work in our lives.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.499 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: To go beyond the
time-space continuum,

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.836 align:middle line:84%
because it's often
very much, not always,

00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:30.304 align:middle line:90%
but it's often future-related.

00:04:30.304 --> 00:04:34.708 align:middle line:84%
And this has been a common,
commonly used modality

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:37.611 align:middle line:84%
for getting information,
even militarily

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:40.748 align:middle line:84%
in strategic situations
in the military,

00:04:40.748 --> 00:04:43.484 align:middle line:84%
throughout the ages,
across the globe.

00:04:43.484 --> 00:04:47.054 align:middle line:84%
These have been used
for military advantage.

00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:53.994 align:middle line:84%
Presidents, kings, leaders,
despots have often consulted

00:04:53.994 --> 00:04:56.563 align:middle line:84%
with these various
experts in these fields.

00:04:56.563 --> 00:04:59.133 align:middle line:84%
It's more common than not
from my understanding.

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:00.534 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Right.

00:05:00.534 --> 00:05:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Every culture, every religion
has incorporated some form

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.407 align:middle line:84%
of divination or some
form of seeking answers

00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:10.644 align:middle line:84%
through the intercession
of some oracle or another.

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:14.148 align:middle line:84%
There's the Oracle at Delphi,
and of course everybody wants

00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:16.116 align:middle line:90%
to know what the future brings.

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:18.318 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can't promise you
that, but there's a lot more

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.521 align:middle line:84%
to divination than
that in the sense

00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:84%
that we can understand patterns,
we can get a sense of the timing

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.195 align:middle line:84%
of things, and of course they
say that timing is everything.

00:05:28.195 --> 00:05:30.831 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times when
these military leaders

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:34.435 align:middle line:84%
and Alexander the Great would
go see the Oracle at Delphi,

00:05:34.435 --> 00:05:37.671 align:middle line:84%
they didn't get so much a
prediction as kind of a riddle

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:42.342 align:middle line:84%
or some indication
of an advisory as to

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.945 align:middle line:84%
when to make the right
move at the right time.

00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:49.049 align:middle line:84%
So this has been a universal
desire up to this day.

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:51.418 align:middle line:84%
It's been going on for
thousands of years.

00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: It can give you --

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.688 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me what
it's really good

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:59.193 align:middle line:84%
at is showing you the dynamic
in play at the moment; although,

00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:00.994 align:middle line:84%
you can also go into
the future with that.

00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:02.229 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Right.

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:84%
You can see the trend lines
and you can get a sense

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.901 align:middle line:84%
of the way the wind is blowing
based on the way things are now.

00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:09.603 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: So let's talk about you.

00:06:09.603 --> 00:06:11.004 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:14.475 align:middle line:84%
When did you first start playing
around with divination tools?

00:06:14.475 --> 00:06:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And I know the I Ching
is really your thing.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.878 align:middle line:90%
You just love that.

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:20.147 align:middle line:84%
You've invested many
years in it.

00:06:20.147 --> 00:06:22.249 align:middle line:84%
And then let's talk about
the other side of your life.

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:25.352 align:middle line:84%
Tell us the story, because it's
really fun and interesting.

00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Well, a long time ago
in a galaxy far, far away,

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.561 align:middle line:84%
I was an undergraduate at UC
Berkley, and I was introduced

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:39.266 align:middle line:84%
to this system, the I
Ching, by this young lady

00:06:39.266 --> 00:06:42.603 align:middle line:84%
who I was really more
interested in than any kind

00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:44.838 align:middle line:84%
of fortune telling game that
she might be showing me.

00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:46.473 align:middle line:90%
But I played along with it,

00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:48.842 align:middle line:84%
and she thought I would
think this was really cool

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:52.079 align:middle line:84%
and so she showed me how
she used it and she asked me

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:53.213 align:middle line:90%
to think of a question

00:06:53.213 --> 00:06:56.183 align:middle line:84%
that I needed some
guidance on or some issue.

00:06:56.183 --> 00:06:57.918 align:middle line:90%
And so I wrote something down

00:06:57.918 --> 00:06:59.586 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't mean
anything to me.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:00.487 align:middle line:90%
I was --

00:07:00.487 --> 00:07:01.788 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Probably thinking of her.

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:04.892 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: I was thinking of her
and I was kind of a young,

00:07:04.892 --> 00:07:07.928 align:middle line:84%
cocky male and I was being a
little bit of a smart aleck,

00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:11.532 align:middle line:84%
and I was kind of internally
making fun of the whole thing.

00:07:11.532 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And so she has me
toss these coins

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.836 align:middle line:90%
and she records the pattern.

00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:18.105 align:middle line:84%
And traditionally when
you do the I Ching,

00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:20.374 align:middle line:90%
you cast three coins six times.

00:07:20.374 --> 00:07:23.043 align:middle line:84%
And then she would draw the six
lines, and then she looked it

00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:29.315 align:middle line:84%
up in this big book she had, and
she opened it to the hexagram

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:32.152 align:middle line:90%
that my pattern indicated.

00:07:32.152 --> 00:07:34.321 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turned out
that the hexagram I got

00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:38.190 align:middle line:84%
that first time was
entitled "youthful folly."

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.128 align:middle line:84%
And the theme of the
hexagram was that the student,

00:07:41.128 --> 00:07:45.666 align:middle line:84%
the young immature student
lacks respect for the teacher.

00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Oh, interesting.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.634 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: But in this case,

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:49.336 align:middle line:84%
the teacher being
the I Ching itself,

00:07:49.336 --> 00:07:52.606 align:middle line:84%
the ancient sage that's
speaking through this oracle.

00:07:52.606 --> 00:07:54.875 align:middle line:90%
And I thought "Oh, wow."

00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:56.443 align:middle line:84%
It didn't even consider
my question

00:07:56.443 --> 00:07:57.911 align:middle line:84%
which really wasn't
a real question.

00:07:57.911 --> 00:07:59.713 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: You didn't have a
legitimate question anyway.

00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:03.016 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Yeah, and it kind
of reflected back at me.

00:08:03.016 --> 00:08:06.219 align:middle line:84%
I was making fun of it
and it made fun of me.

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:07.654 align:middle line:84%
I thought, "Oh, that's
interesting.

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:08.956 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this again."

00:08:08.956 --> 00:08:11.358 align:middle line:84%
Now, this time my attitude
was a little bit different.

00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:15.495 align:middle line:84%
Not more respectful, but this
time instead of making fun

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.631 align:middle line:90%
of it, I was testing it.

00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:19.933 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote down some
other question

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:21.468 align:middle line:90%
that didn't mean anything to me

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:23.670 align:middle line:84%
and I cast the coins
six times...

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.038 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Slow learner.

00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: ...and it comes back with
a hexagram where the text --

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.743 align:middle line:84%
I'll never forget
-- the text said

00:08:29.743 --> 00:08:33.412 align:middle line:84%
"questioning the
sincerity of the speaker."

00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:35.983 align:middle line:90%
"Oh my god, it's testing me."

00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:37.618 align:middle line:84%
So I make fun of it,
it makes fun of me.

00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:39.453 align:middle line:90%
I test it, it tests me.

00:08:39.453 --> 00:08:41.722 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
how this thing works.

00:08:41.722 --> 00:08:44.157 align:middle line:84%
It reflects your energy
and your intention.

00:08:44.157 --> 00:08:46.994 align:middle line:84%
As much as anything
else, it's a mirror.

00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:48.729 align:middle line:84%
And that was my first
introduction

00:08:48.729 --> 00:08:50.697 align:middle line:90%
to divination systems, and since

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:54.201 align:middle line:84%
that time there have been
very few big decisions

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:56.303 align:middle line:84%
that I have been
faced with in my life

00:08:56.303 --> 00:09:00.140 align:middle line:84%
where I haven't consulted the
I Ching and gotten some input

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:84%
from it as one of the
sources of advisement.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:07.114 align:middle line:84%
And then I also became
familiar with astrology,

00:09:07.114 --> 00:09:10.784 align:middle line:84%
which back in the day started
becoming popular in the '70s.

00:09:10.784 --> 00:09:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Tarot cards started
becoming popular in the '70s.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.357 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really get
into that until later,

00:09:17.357 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:90%
but I kind of understood.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.329 align:middle line:90%
These things have a common base.

00:09:22.329 --> 00:09:25.232 align:middle line:84%
They kind of all operate
on the same principles.

00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: That's one
thing I noticed.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.435 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem to
matter which system,

00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:32.005 align:middle line:84%
even some of the lesser-known
like human design or whatnot,

00:09:32.005 --> 00:09:33.407 align:middle line:90%
they all tend to overlay

00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:36.176 align:middle line:84%
and reflect back the same
characteristics, traits,

00:09:36.176 --> 00:09:38.712 align:middle line:90%
principles, timing or whatnot.

00:09:38.712 --> 00:09:40.013 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Right.

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:41.181 align:middle line:84%
So you just have to have a
different set of archetypes.

00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:44.584 align:middle line:84%
You can take a tarot
deck, you've got 78 cards.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:48.322 align:middle line:84%
You take an I Ching system,
you've got 64 hexagrams.

00:09:48.322 --> 00:09:50.457 align:middle line:84%
In numerology, they've
got 22 numbers.

00:09:50.457 --> 00:09:52.459 align:middle line:90%
Some people take that up to 99.

00:09:52.459 --> 00:09:56.496 align:middle line:84%
So... each one of these
things is called an archetype

00:09:56.496 --> 00:09:58.365 align:middle line:84%
or a representative
of an archetype,

00:09:58.365 --> 00:10:00.167 align:middle line:90%
which is a quality of energy.

00:10:00.167 --> 00:10:03.704 align:middle line:84%
So you can divvy up the world
into four types of things:

00:10:03.704 --> 00:10:06.073 align:middle line:90%
air, water, fire, earth.

00:10:06.073 --> 00:10:08.175 align:middle line:84%
Or you can divvy it up
into 12 or whatever.

00:10:08.175 --> 00:10:10.077 align:middle line:90%
So you have a set of archetypes.

00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:13.313 align:middle line:84%
The larger the set of
archetypes, the more specific

00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:15.048 align:middle line:84%
and more precise the
system is going to be.

00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:16.249 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: That makes sense.

00:10:16.249 --> 00:10:17.984 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: So in astrology
you've got tons of stuff.

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:18.985 align:middle line:90%
You've got the planets.

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:19.953 align:middle line:90%
You've got the houses.

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:21.388 align:middle line:90%
You've got the signs.

00:10:21.388 --> 00:10:23.590 align:middle line:84%
That's a very, very
complex system.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.059 align:middle line:84%
You need a computer
for astrology.

00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:27.427 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:29.930 align:middle line:84%
But you had another part of
your life going on because you,

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.100 align:middle line:84%
at Berkley it wasn't really
holding your attention all

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.835 align:middle line:90%
that well, right?

00:10:34.835 --> 00:10:36.136 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Right.

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:37.704 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And so you booked on
down the road and you ended

00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:41.775 align:middle line:84%
up very intrigued with the
budding field of technology

00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:45.812 align:middle line:84%
when the computer
was what, $150,000

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:47.147 align:middle line:90%
and filled up an entire room?

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:47.914 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: That's right.

00:10:47.914 --> 00:10:49.116 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: A miniature version.

00:10:49.116 --> 00:10:51.785 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: It was in the early
'70s, and I had a friend

00:10:51.785 --> 00:10:54.421 align:middle line:84%
who had a job at
a computer center.

00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:55.555 align:middle line:90%
Jeez, what is that?

00:10:55.555 --> 00:10:57.290 align:middle line:90%
He made software.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.692 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:10:58.692 --> 00:11:01.695 align:middle line:84%
And so he would take me there
at night because he had the keys

00:11:01.695 --> 00:11:03.530 align:middle line:84%
to the place and it was a
computer that would take

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.298 align:middle line:90%
up this whole entire room.

00:11:05.298 --> 00:11:08.135 align:middle line:84%
They had less power than
my iPhone does today.

00:11:08.135 --> 00:11:11.104 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a
$150,000 machine.

00:11:11.104 --> 00:11:13.507 align:middle line:84%
And we would go in there late
at night when nobody else was

00:11:13.507 --> 00:11:15.909 align:middle line:84%
around and there was one
little screen the size

00:11:15.909 --> 00:11:19.246 align:middle line:84%
of an oscilloscope and he
had hooked up these joysticks

00:11:19.246 --> 00:11:20.547 align:middle line:90%
and we would play this game.

00:11:20.547 --> 00:11:23.083 align:middle line:84%
And we would play
this game for hours.

00:11:23.083 --> 00:11:25.919 align:middle line:84%
Now, Regina, I'm not
really a computer gamer.

00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:28.321 align:middle line:84%
I've never been much
of a computer gamer,

00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:32.859 align:middle line:84%
but I was so fascinated by
that, because I saw that some

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.561 align:middle line:90%
of these guys at MIT, which is

00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:39.132 align:middle line:84%
where this program had been
developed, had written some code

00:11:39.132 --> 00:11:42.335 align:middle line:84%
and through the agency of
this code that they wrote,

00:11:42.335 --> 00:11:45.505 align:middle line:84%
they delivered this interactive
experience which happened

00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:48.175 align:middle line:90%
to be a game called Space War,

00:11:48.175 --> 00:11:49.843 align:middle line:84%
and it was too little
spaceships.

00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:51.778 align:middle line:84%
But that wasn't really
what excited me.

00:11:51.778 --> 00:11:54.381 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the game per
se, it was the concept

00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:56.917 align:middle line:84%
that you could write code
and deliver an experience.

00:11:56.917 --> 00:12:02.022 align:middle line:84%
And I thought "Wow, there's so
much potential in this field.

00:12:02.022 --> 00:12:05.192 align:middle line:84%
And I started having
visions of multimedia.

00:12:05.192 --> 00:12:07.961 align:middle line:84%
Now, was is back
in the early '70s

00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:10.497 align:middle line:90%
and CD-ROMs were 20 years off.

00:12:10.497 --> 00:12:14.234 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know how
it was going to happen.

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:16.636 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that you
could deliver an experience

00:12:16.636 --> 00:12:21.474 align:middle line:84%
and that it could have graphics
and sounds, that just took me

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:24.778 align:middle line:84%
by surprise and I was
totally fascinated with that.

00:12:24.778 --> 00:12:26.813 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And at that time there
was really nothing else to look

00:12:26.813 --> 00:12:27.814 align:middle line:90%
to that had been developed.

00:12:27.814 --> 00:12:28.915 align:middle line:90%
It hadn't been developed yet.

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:29.883 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: That's right,
that's right.

00:12:29.883 --> 00:12:31.218 align:middle line:84%
There was everything
super high-tech.

00:12:31.218 --> 00:12:32.519 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Okay, so this was
a bona fide download.

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:34.421 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Right, but I did
everything I could to get

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:38.892 align:middle line:84%
into the computer software field
because I was a college dropout,

00:12:38.892 --> 00:12:42.629 align:middle line:84%
and the one skill that I
had was the ability to type.

00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:44.965 align:middle line:84%
So I could type 65
words a minute,

00:12:44.965 --> 00:12:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and I did everything
I could to get a job

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.601 align:middle line:90%
at that computer center.

00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:50.670 align:middle line:84%
I finally landed a
job as a secretary

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.706 align:middle line:84%
and I started my
career in software.

00:12:52.706 --> 00:12:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: I love it.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.775 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Yeah, it's a
pretty good story.

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:59.446 align:middle line:84%
15 years later I was the
Vice President of Marketing

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:02.148 align:middle line:84%
for a high-tech software
company,

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:06.253 align:middle line:84%
and I found myself using the
I Ching more often than usual.

00:13:06.253 --> 00:13:08.855 align:middle line:84%
Now, why? Well, in this
particular company it was

00:13:08.855 --> 00:13:12.292 align:middle line:84%
so dysfunctional and the
office politics were brutal.

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:15.362 align:middle line:84%
And the guy who ran it
was an engineer by trade

00:13:15.362 --> 00:13:17.864 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't really know
how to manage people.

00:13:17.864 --> 00:13:20.901 align:middle line:84%
It was just a horrible
culture, yet there weren't

00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:24.204 align:middle line:84%
that many software marketing
executive positions in Portland

00:13:24.204 --> 00:13:25.538 align:middle line:90%
where I lived at the time.

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:28.174 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really want to leave,
so I was using the I Ching

00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:30.410 align:middle line:90%
to try to keep my balance.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
divination can help us do.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.751 align:middle line:84%
Because in a good set of
archetypes you're going

00:13:37.751 --> 00:13:41.288 align:middle line:84%
to have some that are very
pleasant, like the ones we got

00:13:41.288 --> 00:13:43.156 align:middle line:90%
on the I Ching app today.

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:48.495 align:middle line:84%
But some of them are pleasant
and really delightful.

00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:51.665 align:middle line:84%
And then there are some
that basically counsel you

00:13:51.665 --> 00:13:56.202 align:middle line:84%
to maybe wait a little while,
get a little introspective.

00:13:56.202 --> 00:13:58.672 align:middle line:84%
And then there are others
that are kind of scary

00:13:58.672 --> 00:14:02.108 align:middle line:84%
or they're reflecting
some shadow stuff.

00:14:02.108 --> 00:14:04.244 align:middle line:84%
And there are cards of
tarot, like the death card,

00:14:04.244 --> 00:14:05.378 align:middle line:90%
and people misunderstand that

00:14:05.378 --> 00:14:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and they think it
literally means death.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.317 align:middle line:84%
No, it just means that
something's coming to an end

00:14:10.317 --> 00:14:12.953 align:middle line:84%
and that something's
going to be reborn.

00:14:12.953 --> 00:14:15.956 align:middle line:84%
But in any case, a good system
of archetypes is not going

00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:18.692 align:middle line:90%
to just have all warm fuzzies.

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:21.795 align:middle line:84%
And so it helps us make a
decision because there's a time

00:14:21.795 --> 00:14:25.565 align:middle line:84%
to assert ourselves and
there's a time to run like hell.

00:14:25.565 --> 00:14:28.702 align:middle line:84%
And there's a time to do nothing
and let the dark clouds pass.

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:33.006 align:middle line:84%
So divination systems have this
knowledge, this wisdom built

00:14:33.006 --> 00:14:37.577 align:middle line:84%
into them and they can help
us calibrate our reactions

00:14:37.577 --> 00:14:39.946 align:middle line:84%
and our responses to
the things around us.

00:14:39.946 --> 00:14:42.182 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I was
using the I Ching for in

00:14:42.182 --> 00:14:43.616 align:middle line:90%
that office environment.

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:46.086 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Just trying to survive
it and continue on your path.

00:14:46.086 --> 00:14:48.254 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Yeah, because there were
so many slings and arrows,

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:50.623 align:middle line:84%
there was so much back-biting,
there was just stuff flying

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:55.895 align:middle line:84%
around that was beyond the
ability of my mind to understand

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.865 align:middle line:84%
or logically figure out
what's the best thing to do.

00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:02.135 align:middle line:84%
So I was sort of like
stimulating my intuition

00:15:02.135 --> 00:15:03.970 align:middle line:90%
and taking it from there.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:07.607 align:middle line:90%
And that's when I got the idea

00:15:07.607 --> 00:15:11.144 align:middle line:84%
of inventing divination
software, of the intersection

00:15:11.144 --> 00:15:15.348 align:middle line:84%
between technology and
divination systems.

00:15:15.348 --> 00:15:19.285 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, "Why couldn't
I do this on the computer?'

00:15:19.285 --> 00:15:22.489 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered back to those
original visions that I had.

00:15:22.489 --> 00:15:26.359 align:middle line:84%
In 1989, you know, here
I was using a Macintosh,

00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:27.894 align:middle line:84%
and this was a graphical
computer.

00:15:27.894 --> 00:15:30.263 align:middle line:84%
It was the first
graphical computer.

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:31.998 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea of
putting sounds

00:15:31.998 --> 00:15:34.801 align:middle line:90%
and images on it made sense.

00:15:34.801 --> 00:15:37.971 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there was no
multimedia software at the time

00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:40.707 align:middle line:84%
because CD-ROMs hadn't
been invented yet.

00:15:40.707 --> 00:15:42.809 align:middle line:84%
But I was just so
captivated by the idea

00:15:42.809 --> 00:15:46.579 align:middle line:84%
that I took my life savings
and I hired a programmer

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:49.549 align:middle line:84%
and an artist and actually
created what turned

00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:52.619 align:middle line:84%
out to be one of the
first multimedia titles,

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:55.055 align:middle line:84%
as well as the first
divination software,

00:15:55.055 --> 00:15:57.523 align:middle line:84%
by creating this I Ching
software on two floppy discs,

00:15:57.523 --> 00:15:59.692 align:middle line:84%
so you had to put one
in and take it out

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:00.693 align:middle line:90%
and put the other one in.

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:01.694 align:middle line:84%
You got a little
bit of graphics...

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:03.329 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Seems like
that was forever ago.

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:06.733 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: It was very
primitive, but it was sweet.

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:08.735 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Now, this had to have
been what, the '90s, early --

00:16:08.735 --> 00:16:09.869 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: 1989.

00:16:09.869 --> 00:16:11.171 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: The early, okay.

00:16:11.171 --> 00:16:12.272 align:middle line:90%
So...

00:16:12.272 --> 00:16:14.707 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: So that's why
I'm known as the father

00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:15.542 align:middle line:90%
of interactive divination...

00:16:15.542 --> 00:16:16.476 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: That was a long time ago.

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:17.844 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: because I invented
the genre.

00:16:17.844 --> 00:16:19.112 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know it.

00:16:19.112 --> 00:16:22.015 align:middle line:84%
It was Monte Farber that
called me the father

00:16:22.015 --> 00:16:24.551 align:middle line:84%
of interactive divination
10 years later.

00:16:24.551 --> 00:16:27.053 align:middle line:84%
But he says "Whoa, you were
the first one to ever?"

00:16:27.053 --> 00:16:28.054 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Yeah."

00:16:28.054 --> 00:16:29.155 align:middle line:84%
And he goes "Well,
you're the father

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:30.723 align:middle line:90%
of interactive divination."

00:16:30.723 --> 00:16:33.593 align:middle line:84%
I said "Oh, I never
thought of it that way."

00:16:33.593 --> 00:16:35.628 align:middle line:84%
He says, we should
tell your PR people.

00:16:35.628 --> 00:16:37.564 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't
have any PR people.

00:16:37.564 --> 00:16:39.132 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Well, you should
get some and tell them."

00:16:39.132 --> 00:16:41.034 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: "Get some and tell
them," and you have,

00:16:41.034 --> 00:16:44.337 align:middle line:84%
and people like me
are now starting it.

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Okay. You then, how long
was it before you were able

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.375 align:middle line:84%
to actually create a
really workable system

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:51.411 align:middle line:90%
that the public could access?

00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:52.545 align:middle line:90%
What year...

00:16:52.545 --> 00:16:55.748 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: It took about a
year, and I kept my job.

00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:58.985 align:middle line:84%
I kept doing consulting
for the company

00:16:58.985 --> 00:17:02.155 align:middle line:84%
because when I threatened
to quit,

00:17:02.155 --> 00:17:03.857 align:middle line:90%
it kind of woke the guy up.

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:07.793 align:middle line:84%
And basically the Board of
Directors called me in and said,

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:09.028 align:middle line:90%
"We don't want you to quit.

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:12.232 align:middle line:84%
What's it going to
take for you to stay?"

00:17:12.232 --> 00:17:13.966 align:middle line:90%
So I said, "Can I sleep on it?"

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:19.806 align:middle line:84%
I came back the next day, and
I cast the I Ching that night,

00:17:19.806 --> 00:17:22.742 align:middle line:84%
and it helped me formulate -- I
said, "I think, you know what?

00:17:22.742 --> 00:17:26.279 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask for a 10
percent raise and all this stuff

00:17:26.279 --> 00:17:27.213 align:middle line:90%
that they're going to say no to,

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:29.415 align:middle line:84%
because I want out
of here," right?

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:32.552 align:middle line:84%
So I go back and I showed
them my offer and they said,

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:33.853 align:middle line:90%
"Okay, let's talk about it.?

00:17:33.853 --> 00:17:36.422 align:middle line:84%
And then they called me in,
they said, "We don't want

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:37.690 align:middle line:90%
to give you a 10 percent raise."

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.025 align:middle line:90%
And I thought "Oh, okay."

00:17:39.025 --> 00:17:42.028 align:middle line:84%
And they said, "We want to
give you a 20 percent raise."

00:17:42.028 --> 00:17:45.431 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Oh, really?"

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:48.635 align:middle line:84%
And they said, "Yeah, because
we want you to be happy

00:17:48.635 --> 00:17:50.336 align:middle line:90%
and we want you to stay."

00:17:50.336 --> 00:17:55.441 align:middle line:84%
And I said "Well, I can't be
bought, but I can be rented."

00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:90%
So I stayed for another...

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:58.745 align:middle line:90%
six months.

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:00.079 align:middle line:84%
And during that time I
developed the I Ching,

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:01.548 align:middle line:90%
but I had a problem.

00:18:01.548 --> 00:18:05.251 align:middle line:84%
The problem was that I had about
10 versions of it in book form.

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:07.954 align:middle line:84%
There's about 30 versions
out there right now.

00:18:07.954 --> 00:18:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And I had 10 of them because
I really was devoted to it.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.327 align:middle line:84%
It had become my teacher
since I was a teenager and --

00:18:14.327 --> 00:18:16.362 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't have
the rights to any

00:18:16.362 --> 00:18:18.598 align:middle line:90%
of those in terms of the text.

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:21.968 align:middle line:84%
So my software needed
text, so that inspired me

00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:24.771 align:middle line:84%
to write my own version
of the I Ching.

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:27.574 align:middle line:84%
And I never published
it as a book.

00:18:27.574 --> 00:18:31.311 align:middle line:84%
It always was embedded in the
software, but I wanted a version

00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:35.682 align:middle line:84%
that was not sexist and not
militaristic and more modern

00:18:35.682 --> 00:18:37.917 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit
more lighthearted

00:18:37.917 --> 00:18:39.786 align:middle line:90%
and accessible for people.

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:42.021 align:middle line:84%
So it took about a year
to do the whole thing

00:18:42.021 --> 00:18:43.523 align:middle line:90%
and put it all together.

00:18:43.523 --> 00:18:46.492 align:middle line:84%
And at that point I
thought, "God, this is cool."

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:49.495 align:middle line:84%
I never even considered all
the rational things about,

00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:50.330 align:middle line:90%
is there a market?

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.734 align:middle line:90%
In 1989, there was no market.

00:18:54.734 --> 00:18:57.537 align:middle line:84%
People who knew what the I
Ching was didn't buy software.

00:18:57.537 --> 00:18:59.005 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Uh huh, they had
their book and coins.

00:18:59.005 --> 00:19:00.406 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: They didn't
even like computers.

00:19:00.406 --> 00:19:01.841 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:19:01.841 --> 00:19:02.909 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: And people who bought
software didn't even know what

00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:90%
the I Ching was.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.313 align:middle line:84%
So I had a better
mousetrap that nobody wanted,

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:08.948 align:middle line:84%
but I started the company
anyway because I had

00:19:08.948 --> 00:19:10.850 align:middle line:90%
so much passion for it.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:15.355 align:middle line:84%
I was just doing something I
loved based on two fascinations,

00:19:15.355 --> 00:19:18.124 align:middle line:84%
based on the intersection
of two fascinations

00:19:18.124 --> 00:19:19.926 align:middle line:84%
that I had discovered
when I was young.

00:19:19.926 --> 00:19:21.794 align:middle line:90%
So I did it anyway.

00:19:21.794 --> 00:19:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: That's a totally
blessed life, really.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.332 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people
live their entire lives

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:29.002 align:middle line:84%
and don't find what it
is they truly want to do

00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:30.770 align:middle line:84%
with their time,
energy and devotion.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.806 align:middle line:84%
And you found both
of them early on.

00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And you had an incredibly
successful go of it.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.646 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you had some bumps along
the way, but once you got going,

00:19:39.646 --> 00:19:41.881 align:middle line:84%
an incredibly successful
go of it.

00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:42.849 align:middle line:90%
And --

00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:43.916 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Well, it wasn't
that smooth.

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:44.751 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: No, I know,
there were some bumps.

00:19:44.751 --> 00:19:45.718 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: I mean, I went bankrupt.

00:19:45.718 --> 00:19:46.953 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the company
went bankrupt.

00:19:46.953 --> 00:19:48.087 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: I know.

00:19:48.087 --> 00:19:49.088 align:middle line:84%
You had some bumps, but
you did okay in the end.

00:19:49.088 --> 00:19:49.656 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: But then I
picked it back up again.

00:19:49.656 --> 00:19:51.024 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: You did.

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:54.794 align:middle line:84%
But again, you were guiding
yourself or allowing yourself

00:19:54.794 --> 00:19:57.463 align:middle line:84%
to be guided through the
use of the very tools

00:19:57.463 --> 00:19:58.765 align:middle line:90%
that you were offering people.

00:19:58.765 --> 00:20:00.133 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: I was trusting
my intuition.

00:20:00.133 --> 00:20:06.973 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: How much of the total
really critical decision-making

00:20:06.973 --> 00:20:11.444 align:middle line:84%
that you made along your path
to great success was as a result

00:20:11.444 --> 00:20:15.648 align:middle line:84%
of your relationship with
the I Ching in particular?

00:20:15.648 --> 00:20:17.517 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Well, I asked the I Ching

00:20:17.517 --> 00:20:22.789 align:middle line:84%
if I should make a software
version of the I Ching,

00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:25.958 align:middle line:84%
and I got the hexagram
breakthrough,

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:28.161 align:middle line:90%
which was very encouraging.

00:20:28.161 --> 00:20:31.631 align:middle line:84%
But I never made
decisions based on what --

00:20:31.631 --> 00:20:35.401 align:middle line:84%
you know, and this is what I
have told people over the years

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:38.237 align:middle line:84%
because I built Tarot.com
and we had a tarot,

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:41.507 align:middle line:84%
we added astrology-numerology
to the original I Ching

00:20:41.507 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:84%
that I started with, and
eventually took it all online,

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.412 align:middle line:84%
and that's when things
really started to happen.

00:20:46.412 --> 00:20:50.450 align:middle line:84%
But I've always told people,
"You don't look to these things

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.318 align:middle line:90%
to tell you what to do.

00:20:52.318 --> 00:20:55.455 align:middle line:84%
You look to these things to
support part of your brain,

00:20:55.455 --> 00:20:58.791 align:middle line:84%
to support your right brain,
to support your intuition,

00:20:58.791 --> 00:21:01.094 align:middle line:84%
because at the end of the
day you are responsible

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:02.662 align:middle line:84%
for the decisions
that you make."

00:21:02.662 --> 00:21:04.497 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: You have to
take right action.

00:21:04.497 --> 00:21:05.631 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Right.

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:08.501 align:middle line:84%
And you can't push it
off on somebody else.

00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:12.538 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the issues
I have with the way a lot

00:21:12.538 --> 00:21:13.840 align:middle line:90%
of people use psychics.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.675 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not against psychics.

00:21:15.675 --> 00:21:19.145 align:middle line:84%
Some people are gifted at
the intuitive function,

00:21:19.145 --> 00:21:20.847 align:middle line:84%
more gifted than
the average person.

00:21:20.847 --> 00:21:23.716 align:middle line:84%
But my mission in
creating the software

00:21:23.716 --> 00:21:27.353 align:middle line:84%
and in creating the web site was
to empower the average person

00:21:27.353 --> 00:21:30.423 align:middle line:84%
to tap into their
own psychic ability,

00:21:30.423 --> 00:21:33.126 align:middle line:84%
to stimulate their own intuition
and to become more intuitive

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:35.495 align:middle line:84%
on their own and
take responsibility

00:21:35.495 --> 00:21:37.764 align:middle line:90%
for their own decisions,

00:21:37.764 --> 00:21:39.999 align:middle line:84%
rather than delegating
their decision-making

00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:41.234 align:middle line:90%
to somebody else.

00:21:41.234 --> 00:21:42.869 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes, I totally understand.

00:21:42.869 --> 00:21:45.605 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: And this is a big
theme of mine because a lot

00:21:45.605 --> 00:21:49.509 align:middle line:84%
of people misuse these tools
because they don't want

00:21:49.509 --> 00:21:51.978 align:middle line:84%
to make a decision,
or they go to somebody

00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:54.680 align:middle line:84%
and pay them a hundred bucks
and then they feel obligated

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.283 align:middle line:84%
to believe what they told them
because you don't want to feel

00:21:57.283 --> 00:21:58.785 align:middle line:84%
like you just wasted
a hundred bucks.

00:21:58.785 --> 00:22:00.486 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right, that's true.

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:03.823 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: So it is a high
suggestibility factor

00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:05.158 align:middle line:90%
when you do that.

00:22:05.158 --> 00:22:08.961 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing could be
true of a divination system,

00:22:08.961 --> 00:22:10.997 align:middle line:84%
but there's nobody
in the middle.

00:22:10.997 --> 00:22:12.398 align:middle line:90%
There's no middle man.

00:22:12.398 --> 00:22:17.804 align:middle line:84%
So the whole Zeitgeist of it for
me was this Aquarian Age concept

00:22:17.804 --> 00:22:19.672 align:middle line:90%
that we don't need a middle man.

00:22:19.672 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:90%
We can go direct.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.276 align:middle line:84%
We don't need a priest
and we don't need a guru

00:22:23.276 --> 00:22:25.011 align:middle line:90%
and we don't need a psychic.

00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:28.347 align:middle line:84%
These things might be helpful
if you manage them correctly

00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:31.984 align:middle line:84%
and you take responsibility
for your own decision-making.

00:22:31.984 --> 00:22:35.421 align:middle line:84%
But we have the ability
to go direct, and I wanted

00:22:35.421 --> 00:22:40.159 align:middle line:84%
to use technology to
empower people to do that.

00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:41.494 align:middle line:90%
But people have told me,

00:22:41.494 --> 00:22:43.996 align:middle line:84%
"How can you get a computer
involved with tarot cards?

00:22:43.996 --> 00:22:45.431 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I like to
feel the deck."

00:22:45.431 --> 00:22:47.934 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing people
say now about eBook readers.

00:22:47.934 --> 00:22:51.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, "I want to feel
the book," and I say, "Well,

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:54.006 align:middle line:84%
you know, cardboard's
a technology."

00:22:54.006 --> 00:22:56.843 align:middle line:90%
Dead trees are technology.

00:22:56.843 --> 00:22:59.278 align:middle line:90%
Toxic ink is a technology.

00:22:59.278 --> 00:23:02.381 align:middle line:84%
It's just a different
-- you prefer cardboard,

00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:05.818 align:middle line:84%
you think that cardboard is
a good conductor of energy.

00:23:05.818 --> 00:23:07.987 align:middle line:84%
Now, I understand people
like to play with the cards

00:23:07.987 --> 00:23:09.655 align:middle line:84%
and there's a social
aspect to tarot.

00:23:09.655 --> 00:23:11.357 align:middle line:90%
I have no problem with that.

00:23:11.357 --> 00:23:12.692 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Well, there's
lore around it.

00:23:12.692 --> 00:23:14.627 align:middle line:84%
You have to put your energy
into the cards and so forth.

00:23:14.627 --> 00:23:16.596 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Right, and I'm not
thinking that the cardboard is

00:23:16.596 --> 00:23:20.533 align:middle line:90%
that great a conductor.

00:23:20.533 --> 00:23:23.369 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] Maybe if you
used platinum cards.

00:23:23.369 --> 00:23:24.403 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:26.539 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, point well made.

00:23:26.539 --> 00:23:30.676 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the actual
use of it and what is going on,

00:23:30.676 --> 00:23:33.913 align:middle line:84%
because one thing I've noticed,
it's like, you know, daisies.

00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:35.214 align:middle line:90%
He loves me, he loves me not.

00:23:35.214 --> 00:23:36.582 align:middle line:90%
He loves me, he loves me not.

00:23:36.582 --> 00:23:37.683 align:middle line:90%
Is that --

00:23:37.683 --> 00:23:39.185 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: That's a good
divination system, huh?

00:23:39.185 --> 00:23:42.121 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Well, it's a
primitive one anyway.

00:23:42.121 --> 00:23:47.460 align:middle line:84%
But it seems that
the mindset you go

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.363 align:middle line:84%
in with has everything
to do with results.

00:23:50.363 --> 00:23:53.933 align:middle line:84%
When you go in with
fear and desperation --

00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:56.602 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about that --
versus non-attachment.

00:23:56.602 --> 00:24:00.072 align:middle line:84%
And take some time on that,
because this is a big point.

00:24:00.072 --> 00:24:01.374 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Right.

00:24:01.374 --> 00:24:06.312 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the things
that is a huge benefit

00:24:06.312 --> 00:24:10.550 align:middle line:84%
of using a divination
system or of even going

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:18.824 align:middle line:84%
to a counselor is getting
clear on what your dilemma is

00:24:18.824 --> 00:24:20.860 align:middle line:90%
or what your desire is.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.862 align:middle line:90%
It's knowing what you want.

00:24:22.862 --> 00:24:25.164 align:middle line:84%
The minute that you put
something down on paper,

00:24:25.164 --> 00:24:29.302 align:middle line:84%
like even just writing the
question for an I Ching reading,

00:24:29.302 --> 00:24:33.573 align:middle line:84%
or formulating your
dilemma for a tarot reading,

00:24:33.573 --> 00:24:37.176 align:middle line:84%
just that act alone
gives you a little bit

00:24:37.176 --> 00:24:39.579 align:middle line:90%
of distance from the problem.

00:24:39.579 --> 00:24:42.081 align:middle line:90%
Here's me; here's the issue.

00:24:42.081 --> 00:24:45.551 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: You even have that on the
app itself where you can type in

00:24:45.551 --> 00:24:48.287 align:middle line:84%
and be very clear about
what you're asking.

00:24:48.287 --> 00:24:49.522 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Right.

00:24:49.522 --> 00:24:52.058 align:middle line:84%
And that's to help you
stay focused on this rather

00:24:52.058 --> 00:24:55.428 align:middle line:84%
than be caught up in
your feelings about it.

00:24:55.428 --> 00:24:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, you want to
get a little bit of distance.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:59.865 align:middle line:90%
You want to get less attached.

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:03.569 align:middle line:84%
And then I always
counsel people to start

00:25:03.569 --> 00:25:07.106 align:middle line:84%
with a little affirmation
or meditation or prayer,

00:25:07.106 --> 00:25:11.777 align:middle line:84%
something like, "May I
open my mind to the truth.

00:25:11.777 --> 00:25:17.283 align:middle line:84%
May I only care about learning
what's true in this situation.

00:25:17.283 --> 00:25:21.487 align:middle line:84%
May I let go of my desire
for any particular answer

00:25:21.487 --> 00:25:23.255 align:middle line:90%
or any particular outcome."

00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:26.892 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of a
non-attachment meditation.

00:25:26.892 --> 00:25:29.862 align:middle line:90%
That alone really helps a lot.

00:25:29.862 --> 00:25:31.764 align:middle line:84%
The problem that
we normally have is

00:25:31.764 --> 00:25:33.299 align:middle line:84%
that we have an emotional
reaction

00:25:33.299 --> 00:25:35.568 align:middle line:84%
to something that's bothering
us or something happens

00:25:35.568 --> 00:25:36.702 align:middle line:90%
and we don't understand.

00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:37.637 align:middle line:90%
"Why did that happen?"

00:25:37.637 --> 00:25:39.572 align:middle line:90%
And people go why, why, why?

00:25:39.572 --> 00:25:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we're not meant
to know why right away,

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.445 align:middle line:84%
but we want to know why
because we're afraid

00:25:46.445 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to
spiral downhill.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And so we have these
fear feelings,

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:55.121 align:middle line:84%
and those feelings give rise
to more catastrophic thinking,

00:25:55.121 --> 00:25:58.157 align:middle line:84%
which gives rise to more
fear until we're exhausted

00:25:58.157 --> 00:25:59.692 align:middle line:84%
and we want to just
give our power away,

00:25:59.692 --> 00:26:01.093 align:middle line:84%
and we want to go
pay a hundred bucks

00:26:01.093 --> 00:26:02.795 align:middle line:84%
and tell somebody,
"Fix this for me."

00:26:02.795 --> 00:26:04.363 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Right, "Tell
me what to do."

00:26:04.363 --> 00:26:10.736 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Right, and so it really
behooves us to get more of a...

00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:14.573 align:middle line:84%
non-attached relationship
to our thinking

00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:17.677 align:middle line:84%
and then our feelings have
a chance to simmer down.

00:26:17.677 --> 00:26:20.046 align:middle line:84%
And then we can get
into the mind space

00:26:20.046 --> 00:26:22.648 align:middle line:84%
where we're receptive,
where we're receptive

00:26:22.648 --> 00:26:25.651 align:middle line:84%
to good advice or, we're
receptive to inspiration,

00:26:25.651 --> 00:26:28.554 align:middle line:84%
or we're receptive
to signals that want

00:26:28.554 --> 00:26:30.556 align:middle line:90%
to come to our intuition.

00:26:30.556 --> 00:26:32.058 align:middle line:90%
And that's not so easy.

00:26:32.058 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:84%
When we're wrapped up and
emotionally involved...

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.461 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: It's not easy.

00:26:35.461 --> 00:26:36.729 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: When we're in
an emotional reaction,

00:26:36.729 --> 00:26:39.131 align:middle line:84%
that is the worst time
to make a decision.

00:26:39.131 --> 00:26:40.833 align:middle line:90%
I created this rule.

00:26:40.833 --> 00:26:45.104 align:middle line:84%
I call it O'Brien's
rule, which is actually

00:26:45.104 --> 00:26:46.339 align:middle line:90%
in the next book I'm writing,

00:26:46.339 --> 00:26:48.340 align:middle line:84%
which is Great Decisions,
Perfect Timing.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.909 align:middle line:90%
It's about decision-making.

00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:52.611 align:middle line:84%
It's about the function
of divination.

00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:55.815 align:middle line:84%
And the rule is, the
stronger the emotion,

00:26:55.815 --> 00:26:57.450 align:middle line:90%
the less you can trust it.

00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:58.784 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Absolutely.

00:26:58.784 --> 00:27:01.187 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in my mind's eye I
can see someone sitting there

00:27:01.187 --> 00:27:04.223 align:middle line:84%
with a broken heart and a quart
of ice cream shaking the app

00:27:04.223 --> 00:27:05.991 align:middle line:90%
like crazy trying to --

00:27:05.991 --> 00:27:08.194 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to get
truthful information

00:27:08.194 --> 00:27:09.528 align:middle line:90%
under those conditions.

00:27:09.528 --> 00:27:12.431 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: You know, I knew somebody
who was, she was a singer,

00:27:12.431 --> 00:27:18.304 align:middle line:84%
an opera singer, and a prima
donna of the nth degree.

00:27:18.304 --> 00:27:22.108 align:middle line:84%
Do you know the expression
drama queen, right?

00:27:22.108 --> 00:27:25.211 align:middle line:84%
Do you know the expression
histrionic personality disorder?

00:27:25.211 --> 00:27:29.682 align:middle line:84%
Well, in any case, I
said to her, "Maria --

00:27:29.682 --> 00:27:31.083 align:middle line:90%
" that's not her real name --

00:27:31.083 --> 00:27:37.723 align:middle line:84%
"Maria, the strength of the
feeling does not correlate

00:27:37.723 --> 00:27:40.726 align:middle line:84%
with the accuracy of
your interpretation.

00:27:40.726 --> 00:27:42.595 align:middle line:84%
The stronger the feeling,
the less you can trust it."

00:27:42.595 --> 00:27:46.332 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Just because you
feel something really strongly

00:27:46.332 --> 00:27:47.767 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make it true.

00:27:47.767 --> 00:27:50.035 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make it a
good basis for action."

00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:51.137 align:middle line:90%
And this came as a shock to her.

00:27:51.137 --> 00:27:52.605 align:middle line:84%
It really was a surprising
thing.

00:27:52.605 --> 00:27:54.640 align:middle line:84%
She actually stopped
and thought about it.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.108 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Because her
whole lens was drama.

00:27:56.108 --> 00:27:57.409 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Right, exactly.

00:27:57.409 --> 00:28:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So we want to get --
we want to develop more

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.015 align:middle line:84%
of a non-attached relationship
to our thoughts and feelings.

00:28:03.015 --> 00:28:05.417 align:middle line:84%
This is what meditation
practice helps us do,

00:28:05.417 --> 00:28:07.553 align:middle line:84%
and I think of divination
actually as a type

00:28:07.553 --> 00:28:09.588 align:middle line:90%
of meditation practice.

00:28:09.588 --> 00:28:11.757 align:middle line:84%
You know, they say that
meditation is listening to God.

00:28:11.757 --> 00:28:13.759 align:middle line:84%
They say that prayer
is talking to God.

00:28:13.759 --> 00:28:15.761 align:middle line:84%
Divination is kind
of a two-way channel.

00:28:15.761 --> 00:28:18.164 align:middle line:84%
To do a tarot card
reading or I Ching reading,

00:28:18.164 --> 00:28:21.667 align:middle line:84%
you're basically putting
some query out there

00:28:21.667 --> 00:28:23.836 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting
some information back.

00:28:23.836 --> 00:28:28.974 align:middle line:84%
You're accessing the universal
consciousness, and then by dent

00:28:28.974 --> 00:28:32.478 align:middle line:84%
of the cards that turn up or
the hexagram that you get,

00:28:32.478 --> 00:28:33.813 align:middle line:84%
you're getting some
information back.

00:28:33.813 --> 00:28:36.882 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of a
two-way form of prayer.

00:28:36.882 --> 00:28:39.685 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: So if you do it in that
way, you take the responsibility

00:28:39.685 --> 00:28:43.956 align:middle line:84%
to distance yourself a bit,
be clear on the question

00:28:43.956 --> 00:28:47.259 align:middle line:84%
or the situation that you're
talking about, in that sense,

00:28:47.259 --> 00:28:50.529 align:middle line:84%
then, you have to be
also brave enough to look

00:28:50.529 --> 00:28:52.164 align:middle line:90%
at the cards for what they say.

00:28:52.164 --> 00:28:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, some of
them are "Run like hell."

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.401 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Right.

00:28:55.401 --> 00:28:56.669 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are -- no
matter how eager you are,

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.673 align:middle line:84%
no matter if they're saying,
"We need an answer tomorrow,"

00:29:00.673 --> 00:29:02.675 align:middle line:90%
and the cards say wait...

00:29:02.675 --> 00:29:03.676 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Yeah.

00:29:03.676 --> 00:29:05.077 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the things I love

00:29:05.077 --> 00:29:08.180 align:middle line:84%
about a good divination system,
rather than one that's full

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.449 align:middle line:84%
of warm fuzzies, and
there are decks like that.

00:29:10.449 --> 00:29:13.919 align:middle line:84%
There's so many decks that
people are inventing every year

00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:16.722 align:middle line:84%
and some of them don't have
a balanced set of archetypes

00:29:16.722 --> 00:29:20.559 align:middle line:84%
because every single one of them
is what I call a warm fuzzy.

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:23.629 align:middle line:84%
With a good divination set
of archetypes, like tarot

00:29:23.629 --> 00:29:25.564 align:middle line:84%
or I Ching, you've got
some of these shadow cards

00:29:25.564 --> 00:29:28.200 align:middle line:84%
so those can reflect the whole
picture and give you kind

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.268 align:middle line:90%
of a more objective thing,

00:29:29.268 --> 00:29:30.936 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes you
don't want to see it.

00:29:30.936 --> 00:29:32.304 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you don't
want to hear it.

00:29:32.304 --> 00:29:35.174 align:middle line:84%
But a good divination system
doesn't really give a darn

00:29:35.174 --> 00:29:38.611 align:middle line:84%
about your ego or about
your ego's agenda.

00:29:38.611 --> 00:29:42.648 align:middle line:84%
It's basically about reflecting
the energies that you're

00:29:42.648 --> 00:29:46.318 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of, both
inside yourself and outside

00:29:46.318 --> 00:29:48.354 align:middle line:84%
of yourself, in a
more objective way.

00:29:48.354 --> 00:29:51.323 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason, that's
the best reason to do it,

00:29:51.323 --> 00:29:52.691 align:middle line:90%
is not to reinforce -- you know,

00:29:52.691 --> 00:29:55.127 align:middle line:84%
we had so many people,
at Tarot.com,

00:29:55.127 --> 00:29:58.163 align:middle line:84%
we had customers that were
just using it all the time,

00:29:58.163 --> 00:29:59.632 align:middle line:90%
and I was conflicted.

00:29:59.632 --> 00:30:01.166 align:middle line:90%
As a businessman I loved it.

00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:03.068 align:middle line:90%
It was just more business.

00:30:03.068 --> 00:30:05.471 align:middle line:84%
But as somebody who cares
about people I thought,

00:30:05.471 --> 00:30:07.873 align:middle line:84%
"Wait a minute, you're
using this too much."

00:30:07.873 --> 00:30:09.108 align:middle line:90%
We had to cut some people off,

00:30:09.108 --> 00:30:13.545 align:middle line:84%
basically because they were
spending too much money,

00:30:13.545 --> 00:30:16.215 align:middle line:84%
which was a hard thing
for a businessman to do.

00:30:16.215 --> 00:30:20.986 align:middle line:84%
But they were doing it to just
-- any little decision they had

00:30:20.986 --> 00:30:23.188 align:middle line:84%
to make or whatever, they
were using it to justify

00:30:23.188 --> 00:30:24.523 align:middle line:90%
and they just kept doing it

00:30:24.523 --> 00:30:26.225 align:middle line:84%
until they got the
answer they wanted.

00:30:26.225 --> 00:30:27.493 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes, exactly.

00:30:27.493 --> 00:30:28.727 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: So it really wasn't
doing what it was intended

00:30:28.727 --> 00:30:30.362 align:middle line:90%
to do for them.

00:30:30.362 --> 00:30:32.331 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: When you were talking
about going into the psyche

00:30:32.331 --> 00:30:36.068 align:middle line:84%
on a deeper level, Carl
Jung was very conversant

00:30:36.068 --> 00:30:39.371 align:middle line:84%
and had great respect
for divination.

00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:41.907 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can talk, lay that
foundation for us a bit.

00:30:41.907 --> 00:30:45.044 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Well, he became
fascinated by the I Ching,

00:30:45.044 --> 00:30:47.980 align:middle line:84%
and he also studied
astrology and tarot.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:52.551 align:middle line:84%
And more than anybody, he
defined how these things work.

00:30:52.551 --> 00:30:56.021 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about this
in all of my books,

00:30:56.021 --> 00:30:59.725 align:middle line:84%
but the book Divination: Sacred
Tools for Reading the Mind

00:30:59.725 --> 00:31:01.260 align:middle line:90%
of God, which is right here,

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:84%
that talks about Carl Jung's
research and the principles

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.832 align:middle line:84%
that he came up with,
and so does --

00:31:06.832 --> 00:31:10.436 align:middle line:84%
The Visionary I Ching has some
introductory chapters on that,

00:31:10.436 --> 00:31:12.438 align:middle line:90%
and that's an eBook or an app.

00:31:12.438 --> 00:31:14.873 align:middle line:84%
And then the new book I'm
writing, Great Decisions,

00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:18.811 align:middle line:84%
it's all about -- I'd say
that my mission in life is

00:31:18.811 --> 00:31:23.349 align:middle line:84%
to understand and explain
the more esoteric discoveries

00:31:23.349 --> 00:31:28.053 align:middle line:84%
of Carl Jung and help people
learn how to leverage them.

00:31:28.053 --> 00:31:30.923 align:middle line:84%
Okay, it's one thing to
know about synchronicity

00:31:30.923 --> 00:31:33.859 align:middle line:84%
and archetypes and the
collective unconscious.

00:31:33.859 --> 00:31:35.494 align:middle line:90%
It's another thing to know

00:31:35.494 --> 00:31:37.997 align:middle line:84%
that you can actually
use these things.

00:31:37.997 --> 00:31:42.434 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of a step
beyond where Carl Jung went,

00:31:42.434 --> 00:31:43.535 align:middle line:90%
but a lot of the stuff

00:31:43.535 --> 00:31:47.039 align:middle line:84%
in the New Age movement
is related to that.

00:31:47.039 --> 00:31:48.374 align:middle line:90%
So speaking of divination,

00:31:48.374 --> 00:31:52.077 align:middle line:84%
he came up with these
ideas called synchronicity,

00:31:52.077 --> 00:31:56.148 align:middle line:84%
the synchronicity
principle, archetypes,

00:31:56.148 --> 00:31:57.583 align:middle line:90%
and the collective unconscious.

00:31:57.583 --> 00:32:02.054 align:middle line:84%
And the way they really
define how these things work.

00:32:02.054 --> 00:32:03.789 align:middle line:84%
The archetypes I
mentioned earlier.

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:05.791 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've got
78 archetypes in tarot.

00:32:05.791 --> 00:32:08.093 align:middle line:84%
Each card represents a
different quality of energy,

00:32:08.093 --> 00:32:10.696 align:middle line:84%
a different human
dynamic, a different aspect

00:32:10.696 --> 00:32:14.099 align:middle line:84%
of the personality, a
different way things can go.

00:32:14.099 --> 00:32:15.200 align:middle line:90%
That's archetypes.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.803 align:middle line:84%
It's a power -- these
are universal, too.

00:32:17.803 --> 00:32:20.305 align:middle line:84%
He studied different cultures
and different religions

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:24.309 align:middle line:84%
and different sets of
mythologies and people's dreams

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:25.677 align:middle line:84%
from cultures all
over the world.

00:32:25.677 --> 00:32:29.481 align:middle line:84%
And he found that symbols, that
there are symbols that come

00:32:29.481 --> 00:32:33.619 align:middle line:84%
up in dreams and in
mythology that are universal,

00:32:33.619 --> 00:32:35.821 align:middle line:90%
that are cross-cultural.

00:32:35.821 --> 00:32:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And so he came up
with the concept

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:39.958 align:middle line:90%
of the collective unconscious.

00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:44.363 align:middle line:84%
That we all share in this
resource or all have access

00:32:44.363 --> 00:32:47.099 align:middle line:84%
to this resource where
these things live,

00:32:47.099 --> 00:32:52.938 align:middle line:84%
and that we can go there and
the tool that helps us tune

00:32:52.938 --> 00:32:57.309 align:middle line:84%
in is the intuition,
the sixth sense.

00:32:57.309 --> 00:33:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Synchronicity principle states
that everything is connected

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.882 align:middle line:84%
to everything else, and
that everything is connected

00:33:03.882 --> 00:33:06.618 align:middle line:90%
in time as well as in space.

00:33:06.618 --> 00:33:09.088 align:middle line:84%
Now, in physics, in subatomic
physics, they've proven

00:33:09.088 --> 00:33:12.491 align:middle line:84%
that everything is connected to
everything else; but in science,

00:33:12.491 --> 00:33:16.128 align:middle line:84%
in Western science, we don't
consider the dimension of time.

00:33:16.128 --> 00:33:18.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's assumed that
if you do this experiment

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:23.068 align:middle line:84%
on Tuesday morning and you do
that same controlled experiment

00:33:23.068 --> 00:33:25.704 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the night
on Sunday, you're going

00:33:25.704 --> 00:33:27.473 align:middle line:90%
to get exactly the same result.

00:33:27.473 --> 00:33:29.942 align:middle line:84%
The timing is not going
to affect anything.

00:33:29.942 --> 00:33:32.578 align:middle line:84%
And that's maybe true
in the limited sphere

00:33:32.578 --> 00:33:37.449 align:middle line:84%
of physical matter, which is
what science usually is paying

00:33:37.449 --> 00:33:38.550 align:middle line:90%
attention to.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.486 align:middle line:84%
But the ancient sages,
they were interested

00:33:40.486 --> 00:33:42.020 align:middle line:90%
in a different kind of question.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.722 align:middle line:84%
They were specifically
interested in,

00:33:43.722 --> 00:33:46.525 align:middle line:84%
how do things go
together in time?

00:33:46.525 --> 00:33:49.862 align:middle line:84%
Which is related to every
timing question that there is.

00:33:49.862 --> 00:33:52.931 align:middle line:84%
It's related to, "When
should I get married,"

00:33:52.931 --> 00:33:55.734 align:middle line:84%
or "make my next move
in this negotiation?"

00:33:55.734 --> 00:34:00.405 align:middle line:84%
Or there's all kinds of issues
that are related to timing

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:05.644 align:middle line:84%
and social issues
and political issues

00:34:05.644 --> 00:34:07.479 align:middle line:84%
that are related
to that question.

00:34:07.479 --> 00:34:11.216 align:middle line:84%
So the synchronicity principle
says that everything is related

00:34:11.216 --> 00:34:12.551 align:middle line:84%
to everything else
that's happening

00:34:12.551 --> 00:34:14.753 align:middle line:90%
at the same moment in time.

00:34:14.753 --> 00:34:17.956 align:middle line:84%
So that if you look at a
map of a moment in time,

00:34:17.956 --> 00:34:21.459 align:middle line:84%
which is really what the
horoscope wheel is --

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:27.099 align:middle line:84%
that's a snapshot from the
place you were born looking

00:34:27.099 --> 00:34:28.300 align:middle line:90%
at the sky.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:33.171 align:middle line:84%
It's a 180-degree round
circle snapshot of the sky

00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:36.809 align:middle line:84%
at that moment, if you
could see the planets.

00:34:36.809 --> 00:34:39.211 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously in the
daytime you can't see them.

00:34:39.211 --> 00:34:40.612 align:middle line:90%
But that's what --

00:34:40.612 --> 00:34:44.883 align:middle line:84%
that astrology chart actually
is an astronomical photograph

00:34:44.883 --> 00:34:48.954 align:middle line:84%
of the sky at a moment in time
from a particular place in time.

00:34:48.954 --> 00:34:51.490 align:middle line:84%
You can take that mapping
and you can read it,

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:54.726 align:middle line:84%
if you know how, and that's
what astrology is all about.

00:34:54.726 --> 00:34:56.895 align:middle line:84%
If you do an I Ching
reading, boom:

00:34:56.895 --> 00:34:58.664 align:middle line:84%
the way the coins
land is related

00:34:58.664 --> 00:35:00.098 align:middle line:84%
to everything else
that's happening

00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:02.434 align:middle line:84%
at that moment or
during that time.

00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:05.537 align:middle line:84%
And if you're focused on a
question, if you're meditating,

00:35:05.537 --> 00:35:09.208 align:middle line:84%
like I was saying before,
if you have defined an issue

00:35:09.208 --> 00:35:13.378 align:middle line:84%
or a question or a dilemma,
and you stay meditating

00:35:13.378 --> 00:35:15.747 align:middle line:84%
on that while you cast
the coins, you're going

00:35:15.747 --> 00:35:18.283 align:middle line:84%
to get a pattern
that presumably,

00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:20.185 align:middle line:84%
according to the
synchronicity principle,

00:35:20.185 --> 00:35:22.854 align:middle line:84%
is related to what you
were thinking about,

00:35:22.854 --> 00:35:24.856 align:middle line:84%
since you were the
one casting the coins.

00:35:24.856 --> 00:35:27.759 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with the cards:
the cards that you pull

00:35:27.759 --> 00:35:30.896 align:middle line:84%
when you're focused -- if you're
not focused, you're just going

00:35:30.896 --> 00:35:32.364 align:middle line:84%
to kind of get a
general reflection.

00:35:32.364 --> 00:35:33.732 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:35:33.732 --> 00:35:36.068 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people use tarot
cards just to meditate.

00:35:36.068 --> 00:35:37.236 align:middle line:90%
They'll pull a card every day,

00:35:37.236 --> 00:35:39.638 align:middle line:84%
or they'll cast the I
Ching every day just

00:35:39.638 --> 00:35:41.506 align:middle line:84%
to give themselves
something to think about,

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:42.808 align:middle line:90%
because every single one

00:35:42.808 --> 00:35:46.211 align:middle line:84%
of those 78 archetypes is
inside of you all the time.

00:35:46.211 --> 00:35:49.047 align:middle line:84%
It's just which one needs
to be called up now?

00:35:49.047 --> 00:35:52.017 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a question, you
can use a divination system

00:35:52.017 --> 00:35:54.753 align:middle line:84%
to call up archetypes
that are going

00:35:54.753 --> 00:35:56.989 align:middle line:84%
to give you a message
that's going

00:35:56.989 --> 00:36:00.792 align:middle line:84%
to help you deal
with that dilemma.

00:36:00.792 --> 00:36:04.529 align:middle line:84%
So Carl Jung, he explained
it all with synchronicity

00:36:04.529 --> 00:36:07.766 align:middle line:84%
and archetypes and the
collective unconscious.

00:36:07.766 --> 00:36:10.535 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going -- what
I'm doing is I'm trying

00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:14.006 align:middle line:84%
to help people learn how to use
synchronicity and archetypes

00:36:14.006 --> 00:36:15.207 align:middle line:90%
to make better decisions,

00:36:15.207 --> 00:36:17.476 align:middle line:84%
whether they use
divination or not.

00:36:17.476 --> 00:36:21.346 align:middle line:84%
So in my new book, which is
coming out in six months,

00:36:21.346 --> 00:36:25.517 align:middle line:84%
Great Decisions, Perfect Timing,
I've got about seven pillars

00:36:25.517 --> 00:36:28.453 align:middle line:84%
of visionary decision making
and divination is one of them.

00:36:28.453 --> 00:36:30.055 align:middle line:90%
But you don't have to use it.

00:36:30.055 --> 00:36:32.024 align:middle line:84%
There are other things
you can do,

00:36:32.024 --> 00:36:33.358 align:middle line:90%
but that's another conversation.

00:36:33.358 --> 00:36:34.726 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes, it is.

00:36:34.726 --> 00:36:37.129 align:middle line:84%
When the book is released, we'll
come back and do this again.

00:36:37.129 --> 00:36:40.632 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
area that gets,

00:36:40.632 --> 00:36:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I think is muddied all the
time and that has to do

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:49.107 align:middle line:84%
with an egoic desire
or an immature desire

00:36:49.107 --> 00:36:51.910 align:middle line:90%
versus the soul's desire.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:56.682 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times people
cannot separate which one it is.

00:36:56.682 --> 00:36:58.617 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that for a bit:

00:36:58.617 --> 00:37:02.854 align:middle line:84%
how you get into more alignment
with the soul's desire than kind

00:37:02.854 --> 00:37:04.690 align:middle line:90%
of a quick fix of the ego.

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:06.091 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Right.

00:37:06.091 --> 00:37:10.629 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think it has a lot to do
with developing the intuition,

00:37:10.629 --> 00:37:15.133 align:middle line:84%
and that's what divination
helps,

00:37:15.133 --> 00:37:18.136 align:middle line:84%
is one tool for helping
us to do.

00:37:18.136 --> 00:37:27.212 align:middle line:84%
The ego basically operates from
a delusionary point of view.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:32.217 align:middle line:84%
The egocentric point of view
kind of goes like this: "Okay,

00:37:32.217 --> 00:37:36.288 align:middle line:84%
rationally I know I'm not
the center of the universe.

00:37:36.288 --> 00:37:40.025 align:middle line:84%
But I might as well be,
as far as I'm concerned."

00:37:40.025 --> 00:37:45.097 align:middle line:84%
So we put so much stock and we
take everything so personally

00:37:45.097 --> 00:37:47.132 align:middle line:90%
because of that attitude.

00:37:47.132 --> 00:37:49.701 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of hard -- I'm not
trying to put anybody down,

00:37:49.701 --> 00:37:51.136 align:middle line:90%
this is the human condition.

00:37:51.136 --> 00:37:54.473 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're here
to learn how to overcome.

00:37:54.473 --> 00:37:57.976 align:middle line:84%
And so the egocentric
point of view is going

00:37:57.976 --> 00:38:01.646 align:middle line:84%
to take a very small-minded
approach to things.

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:07.319 align:middle line:84%
We can get beyond that
by using the sixth sense,

00:38:07.319 --> 00:38:10.322 align:middle line:84%
which is what they've called the
intuition for a thousand years,

00:38:10.322 --> 00:38:13.458 align:middle line:84%
and the sixth sense can
get us out of our own way

00:38:13.458 --> 00:38:16.461 align:middle line:84%
and can get us out of
our mind and help us tap

00:38:16.461 --> 00:38:18.830 align:middle line:84%
into that collective
unconscious and help us tap

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:22.467 align:middle line:84%
into the spiritual realm or the
realm of infinite intelligence

00:38:22.467 --> 00:38:24.102 align:middle line:90%
or whatever we want to call it.

00:38:24.102 --> 00:38:26.705 align:middle line:84%
This has been written up
in so many different ways.

00:38:26.705 --> 00:38:29.908 align:middle line:84%
Napolean Hill called it
infinite intelligence.

00:38:29.908 --> 00:38:33.011 align:middle line:84%
Ralph Waldo Emerson
called it infinite mind,

00:38:33.011 --> 00:38:34.846 align:middle line:84%
or there were all these
things it was called.

00:38:34.846 --> 00:38:38.116 align:middle line:84%
And we can tap into that, but
we can't tap into that as long

00:38:38.116 --> 00:38:40.552 align:middle line:84%
as we're trying to
defend ourselves,

00:38:40.552 --> 00:38:43.221 align:middle line:84%
as long as we're trying to
protect what we think we have

00:38:43.221 --> 00:38:47.092 align:middle line:84%
or what we think we're entitled
to, which is the ego's job.

00:38:47.092 --> 00:38:50.028 align:middle line:84%
So I think the ego
is very important,

00:38:50.028 --> 00:38:52.964 align:middle line:84%
but it's not meant
to run the show.

00:38:52.964 --> 00:38:56.601 align:middle line:84%
It's a lieutenant,
not a general.

00:38:56.601 --> 00:39:00.072 align:middle line:84%
The ego deals in the dualistic
realm, the realm of subject

00:39:00.072 --> 00:39:03.175 align:middle line:84%
and object, and it gets
things done and it takes care

00:39:03.175 --> 00:39:06.311 align:middle line:84%
of business and it pays
the bills and it's a very,

00:39:06.311 --> 00:39:08.880 align:middle line:84%
very important part
of who we are.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.016 align:middle line:84%
It's a functional
part of who we are.

00:39:11.016 --> 00:39:16.555 align:middle line:84%
It's only when it usurps power
and when we give power to it

00:39:16.555 --> 00:39:19.324 align:middle line:84%
that it starts causing
all kinds of problems.

00:39:19.324 --> 00:39:24.229 align:middle line:84%
And it basically kind of goes
like this: the ego says, "Well,

00:39:24.229 --> 00:39:26.665 align:middle line:84%
it's a dangerous world,
and people are trying

00:39:26.665 --> 00:39:31.303 align:middle line:84%
to take advantage of you,
and there's a lot of things

00:39:31.303 --> 00:39:35.340 align:middle line:84%
to be afraid of or
feel guilty about,

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.910 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to
take care of it.

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:41.346 align:middle line:84%
Trust me, I'm going
to control things.

00:39:41.346 --> 00:39:43.048 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get things
under control and I'm going

00:39:43.048 --> 00:39:45.784 align:middle line:84%
to take care of it," When really
it's the ego that's making us

00:39:45.784 --> 00:39:47.752 align:middle line:90%
afraid and guilty to begin with.

00:39:47.752 --> 00:39:48.987 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of a scam.

00:39:48.987 --> 00:39:50.322 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah, definitely.

00:39:50.322 --> 00:39:52.524 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Now, the intuition is
the way to get out of that,

00:39:52.524 --> 00:39:53.625 align:middle line:90%
but it's pretty hard to get

00:39:53.625 --> 00:39:55.961 align:middle line:84%
out of the intuition
if you're stirred up.

00:39:55.961 --> 00:39:57.796 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about that earlier.

00:39:57.796 --> 00:40:00.265 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a state
of emotional reaction,

00:40:00.265 --> 00:40:02.300 align:middle line:84%
which you're going to be
if you're defensive --

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:05.270 align:middle line:84%
you know, the ego's function
is to defend the boundaries.

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:06.972 align:middle line:90%
Okay, that's good.

00:40:06.972 --> 00:40:08.340 align:middle line:90%
That's useful.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.108 align:middle line:90%
We need to do that sometimes.

00:40:10.108 --> 00:40:11.576 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's very important.

00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:13.945 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the subject's got
to defend against the object

00:40:13.945 --> 00:40:16.381 align:middle line:84%
because the object's
attacking it or whatever.

00:40:16.381 --> 00:40:19.484 align:middle line:84%
There are dangers in life and
the ego defends the boundaries.

00:40:19.484 --> 00:40:21.987 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to
grow and expand

00:40:21.987 --> 00:40:25.323 align:middle line:84%
and start manifesting
things creatively,

00:40:25.323 --> 00:40:27.192 align:middle line:84%
you've got to be able
to transcend that,

00:40:27.192 --> 00:40:30.328 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the sixth
sense, the intuition, comes in.

00:40:30.328 --> 00:40:34.132 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
the intuitive sense,

00:40:34.132 --> 00:40:38.770 align:middle line:84%
the sixth sense, is so much more
delicate than the other five.

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:39.538 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Exactly.

00:40:39.538 --> 00:40:40.805 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:40:40.805 --> 00:40:42.674 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: I like to use the
analogy -- okay, here's my hand.

00:40:42.674 --> 00:40:44.643 align:middle line:84%
Let's say the palm of
my hand is the mind

00:40:44.643 --> 00:40:49.147 align:middle line:84%
and these five fingers are
antennae, huge antennae.

00:40:49.147 --> 00:40:52.617 align:middle line:84%
They're the five senses,
especially the visual one.

00:40:52.617 --> 00:40:55.353 align:middle line:84%
You know, the visual cortex
takes up half your brain.

00:40:55.353 --> 00:40:56.655 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's powerful.

00:40:56.655 --> 00:40:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting
all these signals

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:00.926 align:middle line:84%
from the five senses
all the time,

00:41:00.926 --> 00:41:02.761 align:middle line:84%
and then we've got
the clattering of --

00:41:02.761 --> 00:41:05.030 align:middle line:84%
the internal clattering
of the mind itself.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:06.932 align:middle line:84%
Okay, that's a lot
of noise going on.

00:41:06.932 --> 00:41:08.066 align:middle line:90%
Then there's this tiny,

00:41:08.066 --> 00:41:11.369 align:middle line:84%
dinky little sixth
antenna that's calibrated

00:41:11.369 --> 00:41:15.507 align:middle line:84%
to a very subtle fine signal,
and it's easily drowned

00:41:15.507 --> 00:41:17.609 align:middle line:90%
out by all this noise.

00:41:17.609 --> 00:41:19.578 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we've got
to get some detachment.

00:41:19.578 --> 00:41:21.012 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get
some non-attachment.

00:41:21.012 --> 00:41:24.049 align:middle line:84%
We've got, we need some help,
whether we use meditation

00:41:24.049 --> 00:41:28.353 align:middle line:84%
or whether we use divination or
whether we channel archetypes,

00:41:28.353 --> 00:41:31.790 align:middle line:84%
we've got to clear
the channel for this.

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think you were
referring to by the spirit realm

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.628 align:middle line:90%
and getting in touch with that.

00:41:36.628 --> 00:41:39.464 align:middle line:84%
And when we can do that, then
the ego gets calibrated to that.

00:41:39.464 --> 00:41:41.566 align:middle line:84%
So if the ego's calling the
shots, we have a problem.

00:41:41.566 --> 00:41:43.768 align:middle line:84%
But if the ego can
start taking direction

00:41:43.768 --> 00:41:47.439 align:middle line:84%
from the spiritual
self, which is...

00:41:47.439 --> 00:41:52.244 align:middle line:84%
aided and abetted by
listening to this antenna,

00:41:52.244 --> 00:41:55.013 align:middle line:84%
then everything's going
to work really well.

00:41:55.013 --> 00:41:57.849 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Most people don't have
an experience yet, though,

00:41:57.849 --> 00:42:00.652 align:middle line:84%
of knowing that it's
going to be okay.

00:42:00.652 --> 00:42:05.657 align:middle line:84%
Your intuition, your being is
perfectly equipped to make sure

00:42:05.657 --> 00:42:08.526 align:middle line:84%
that everything goes
just as it needs to.

00:42:08.526 --> 00:42:10.195 align:middle line:90%
And without that -- I mean,

00:42:10.195 --> 00:42:12.597 align:middle line:84%
people who are very
strongly based in any

00:42:12.597 --> 00:42:16.401 align:middle line:84%
of the world's religions
maybe have more of that going

00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:18.136 align:middle line:84%
in saying, "No, I've just
turned it over to God.

00:42:18.136 --> 00:42:19.437 align:middle line:90%
Everything's going to be okay.

00:42:19.437 --> 00:42:22.674 align:middle line:84%
I just wait for my
instruction, my knowingness

00:42:22.674 --> 00:42:24.075 align:middle line:90%
to happen through God."

00:42:24.075 --> 00:42:26.611 align:middle line:84%
And so it's put in
a religious context.

00:42:26.611 --> 00:42:28.580 align:middle line:84%
It's taking the burden
off the ego.

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:31.683 align:middle line:84%
But for the average person,
how do you go from the one

00:42:31.683 --> 00:42:33.818 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't have, say,
a traditional background

00:42:33.818 --> 00:42:37.789 align:middle line:84%
in religion and faith to
developing faith in self enough

00:42:37.789 --> 00:42:41.760 align:middle line:84%
where you can relax and quiet
down the other five senses?

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.861 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Right.

00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:46.164 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of good
things in religion.

00:42:46.164 --> 00:42:50.201 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of good
practices in all the religions,

00:42:50.201 --> 00:42:54.472 align:middle line:84%
and they all share a
lot of common things.

00:42:54.472 --> 00:42:57.342 align:middle line:84%
Where I have a problem
with religion is

00:42:57.342 --> 00:43:00.478 align:middle line:90%
when it infantilizes people.

00:43:00.478 --> 00:43:02.347 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, I
think it's very important

00:43:02.347 --> 00:43:04.482 align:middle line:90%
to develop a strong ego.

00:43:04.482 --> 00:43:08.953 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to talk
down about the ego.

00:43:08.953 --> 00:43:12.857 align:middle line:84%
The only problem is when the
ego is controlling things.

00:43:12.857 --> 00:43:14.559 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very important
to have a strong ego,

00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:17.629 align:middle line:84%
because how can you
really let go of an ego

00:43:17.629 --> 00:43:19.698 align:middle line:90%
if you haven't developed it yet?

00:43:19.698 --> 00:43:22.667 align:middle line:84%
How can you let go of something
you don't have a hold of?

00:43:22.667 --> 00:43:24.969 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important to
go through the whole cycle.

00:43:24.969 --> 00:43:27.672 align:middle line:84%
You've got to leave the
Garden of Eden and you've got

00:43:27.672 --> 00:43:29.507 align:middle line:84%
to start making decisions
for yourself.

00:43:29.507 --> 00:43:32.977 align:middle line:84%
So if I was to use
religious terminology,

00:43:32.977 --> 00:43:36.581 align:middle line:84%
I'd say that God wants you to
be a grown-up and God wants you

00:43:36.581 --> 00:43:41.653 align:middle line:84%
to co-create with the divine
intelligence, not to be just

00:43:41.653 --> 00:43:43.521 align:middle line:84%
like a child and do
what you're told.

00:43:43.521 --> 00:43:44.889 align:middle line:90%
Who's telling you anyway?

00:43:44.889 --> 00:43:48.026 align:middle line:84%
It's some priest or
minister or some middle man.

00:43:48.026 --> 00:43:51.329 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: But on the planet that's
kind of what the dilemma is.

00:43:51.329 --> 00:43:54.799 align:middle line:84%
You have people who have no
faith in anything and thus live

00:43:54.799 --> 00:43:58.403 align:middle line:84%
by fear and ego, and you
have this faith, as you say,

00:43:58.403 --> 00:43:59.704 align:middle line:90%
that's somewhat immature.

00:43:59.704 --> 00:44:01.106 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Right, exactly.

00:44:01.106 --> 00:44:03.074 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And so you want to find
that really perfect middle zone.

00:44:03.074 --> 00:44:08.346 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the ego, the ego
is an aspect of self.

00:44:08.346 --> 00:44:12.617 align:middle line:84%
When you take it with the big
E, it is the sum of everything

00:44:12.617 --> 00:44:15.487 align:middle line:84%
that we have created and
expresses itself outward.

00:44:15.487 --> 00:44:17.622 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that is part of the ego.

00:44:17.622 --> 00:44:19.257 align:middle line:84%
And so I understand
what you're saying.

00:44:19.257 --> 00:44:21.960 align:middle line:84%
But the negative part of ego,
which is the fearful part

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:24.796 align:middle line:84%
that is trying to take
control and squeezing

00:44:24.796 --> 00:44:28.566 align:middle line:84%
out any other input, that
little place in there,

00:44:28.566 --> 00:44:31.636 align:middle line:84%
how do people come to
become comfortable there

00:44:31.636 --> 00:44:34.939 align:middle line:84%
to relax a little bit so they
can even look at the cards?

00:44:34.939 --> 00:44:36.007 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Right, yeah.

00:44:36.007 --> 00:44:37.609 align:middle line:90%
I think faith is very important,

00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:40.011 align:middle line:84%
but I would define
faith differently

00:44:40.011 --> 00:44:41.579 align:middle line:90%
than it's commonly defined.

00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:44.716 align:middle line:84%
To me, faith is not
about your beliefs.

00:44:44.716 --> 00:44:46.017 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: No, not at all.

00:44:46.017 --> 00:44:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: To me, faith
is about confidence.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.657 align:middle line:84%
And confidence comes from
the Latin, "confideo."

00:44:52.657 --> 00:44:56.261 align:middle line:84%
"Fideo" means to believe,
and "con" means within,

00:44:56.261 --> 00:44:57.595 align:middle line:90%
so to "believe in yourself."

00:44:57.595 --> 00:44:59.097 align:middle line:90%
That's what confidence means.

00:44:59.097 --> 00:45:03.134 align:middle line:84%
So I think if you have
faith in your ability to tap

00:45:03.134 --> 00:45:06.771 align:middle line:84%
into the spiritual realm,
using your intuition,

00:45:06.771 --> 00:45:09.674 align:middle line:84%
and you have faith in
your own resourcefulness,

00:45:09.674 --> 00:45:13.311 align:middle line:84%
and you have faith in the
resources that are available

00:45:13.311 --> 00:45:16.381 align:middle line:84%
to you coming from the
spiritual realm, you don't have

00:45:16.381 --> 00:45:18.082 align:middle line:90%
to have it all figured out.

00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:23.021 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to -- it doesn't
really matter what you believe

00:45:23.021 --> 00:45:26.591 align:middle line:84%
just as long as you
believe in yourself.

00:45:26.591 --> 00:45:29.694 align:middle line:84%
In other words, in your own
-- and so that way you evolve

00:45:29.694 --> 00:45:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and that way you
become a better person,

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:35.166 align:middle line:90%
you become a bigger person.

00:45:35.166 --> 00:45:38.469 align:middle line:84%
So it's what we're here
to do and it's not easy.

00:45:38.469 --> 00:45:39.237 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Absolutely.

00:45:39.237 --> 00:45:40.572 align:middle line:90%
Well, I wanted to bring it

00:45:40.572 --> 00:45:43.608 align:middle line:84%
up because most people are
pinging off of one or the other.

00:45:43.608 --> 00:45:44.809 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Right.

00:45:44.809 --> 00:45:46.244 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't
have a lot of confidence.

00:45:46.244 --> 00:45:48.947 align:middle line:84%
I don't think, as
far as beliefs go,

00:45:48.947 --> 00:45:50.982 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you should
believe in anything

00:45:50.982 --> 00:45:52.617 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't make sense to you.

00:45:52.617 --> 00:45:56.087 align:middle line:84%
But it might not make
-- logic is not enough.

00:45:56.087 --> 00:45:58.489 align:middle line:90%
It might make intuitive sense.

00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:01.092 align:middle line:84%
Like for instance, I
believe in reincarnation.

00:46:01.092 --> 00:46:02.360 align:middle line:90%
I can't prove it.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.629 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to have
an argument about it.

00:46:04.629 --> 00:46:08.233 align:middle line:84%
But I believe it because it
makes intuitive sense to me.

00:46:08.233 --> 00:46:09.868 align:middle line:90%
But that's just me.

00:46:09.868 --> 00:46:12.937 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else it might not
make intuitive sense to them,

00:46:12.937 --> 00:46:16.541 align:middle line:84%
but for the most part, people
who disbelieve it disbelieve it

00:46:16.541 --> 00:46:18.543 align:middle line:84%
because they're belief
system doesn't allow for it

00:46:18.543 --> 00:46:21.246 align:middle line:84%
or because their orthodoxy
has said "No, no, no."

00:46:21.246 --> 00:46:24.048 align:middle line:84%
They say the same thing about
divination and it's so ironic.

00:46:24.048 --> 00:46:27.285 align:middle line:84%
All of the major religions had
reincarnation, or I don't know

00:46:27.285 --> 00:46:30.388 align:middle line:84%
about Islam, but the others all
had reincarnation at some point

00:46:30.388 --> 00:46:32.423 align:middle line:84%
and then it got stamped
out by the orthodoxy.

00:46:32.423 --> 00:46:33.658 align:middle line:90%
Same thing as divination.

00:46:33.658 --> 00:46:36.961 align:middle line:84%
There was divination
in the Jewish religion.

00:46:36.961 --> 00:46:38.997 align:middle line:84%
There is divination
all through the Bible.

00:46:38.997 --> 00:46:41.232 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: I was going to ask
you that a little bit ago.

00:46:41.232 --> 00:46:44.802 align:middle line:84%
Mention a couple of places
where it's mentioned.

00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:47.005 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Well, I don't have
the chapter and verse,

00:46:47.005 --> 00:46:50.441 align:middle line:84%
but in the book Divination,
I've got a whole appendix there,

00:46:50.441 --> 00:46:53.811 align:middle line:84%
every verse in the Bible
that mentions divination.

00:46:53.811 --> 00:47:00.051 align:middle line:84%
And God's more for
it than against it!

00:47:00.051 --> 00:47:03.922 align:middle line:84%
There's many more verses where
he's praising the astrologers

00:47:03.922 --> 00:47:05.857 align:middle line:84%
or the diviners or he's
actually asking them

00:47:05.857 --> 00:47:07.625 align:middle line:90%
to use the divination system.

00:47:07.625 --> 00:47:12.730 align:middle line:84%
The Jews had a divination
system called Urim and Thummim,

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:14.532 align:middle line:90%
and it was kind of these dice --

00:47:14.532 --> 00:47:18.002 align:middle line:84%
we're not sure, but they were
these dice or runes or something

00:47:18.002 --> 00:47:20.772 align:middle line:84%
like that kept in the
breastplate of the high priest,

00:47:20.772 --> 00:47:22.206 align:middle line:84%
and if there was a
major decision --

00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:24.943 align:middle line:84%
and there's many verses in
the Bible where God says,

00:47:24.943 --> 00:47:26.978 align:middle line:84%
"Use the Urim and
Thummim to figure

00:47:26.978 --> 00:47:29.414 align:middle line:84%
out who the next general should
be," and stuff like that.

00:47:29.414 --> 00:47:32.984 align:middle line:84%
So he actually tells them to use
divination to make a decision.

00:47:32.984 --> 00:47:35.553 align:middle line:84%
And they cast lots, in the
New Testament they cast lots

00:47:35.553 --> 00:47:37.922 align:middle line:84%
to replace Judas with
another disciple.

00:47:37.922 --> 00:47:39.524 align:middle line:84%
Casting lots is a
form of divination.

00:47:39.524 --> 00:47:42.193 align:middle line:84%
Flipping a coin is a
form of divination.

00:47:42.193 --> 00:47:43.594 align:middle line:90%
But they cast lots, believing

00:47:43.594 --> 00:47:46.431 align:middle line:84%
that the way the lots landed
was the way God wanted them

00:47:46.431 --> 00:47:48.466 align:middle line:90%
to land; that's divination.

00:47:48.466 --> 00:47:51.936 align:middle line:84%
So there's, it's a real
interesting study that we went

00:47:51.936 --> 00:47:53.838 align:middle line:90%
through to isolate every verse

00:47:53.838 --> 00:47:56.975 align:middle line:84%
that mentions diviners,
prophets...

00:47:56.975 --> 00:48:00.778 align:middle line:90%
and astrology in the Bible.

00:48:00.778 --> 00:48:04.916 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, in Leviticus
God's pretty ticked off

00:48:04.916 --> 00:48:06.351 align:middle line:90%
at the astrologers.

00:48:06.351 --> 00:48:11.155 align:middle line:84%
But who knows what point in
history that was and who --

00:48:11.155 --> 00:48:12.357 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a
lot of other cases

00:48:12.357 --> 00:48:13.691 align:middle line:90%
where He says, "Call them in."

00:48:13.691 --> 00:48:15.960 align:middle line:90%
And so it's very interesting.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:19.464 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: It is, and yet the
religion that had once accepted

00:48:19.464 --> 00:48:23.101 align:middle line:84%
that and espoused the use of it
then later came to condemn it,

00:48:23.101 --> 00:48:26.604 align:middle line:84%
and really we have been
living in the backlash of that

00:48:26.604 --> 00:48:28.272 align:middle line:84%
for the last several
hundred years,

00:48:28.272 --> 00:48:31.175 align:middle line:84%
where it became something
used by witches and kooks

00:48:31.175 --> 00:48:32.910 align:middle line:90%
and frauds and the like.

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:35.713 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Right, right,
because religion became

00:48:35.713 --> 00:48:39.817 align:middle line:84%
institutionalized,
it was politicized,

00:48:39.817 --> 00:48:42.754 align:middle line:84%
it was all about
controlling the people.

00:48:42.754 --> 00:48:44.889 align:middle line:84%
You know, even the
formation of the books

00:48:44.889 --> 00:48:50.395 align:middle line:84%
of the Bible is a case study
in the politics of religion.

00:48:50.395 --> 00:48:53.865 align:middle line:84%
You know, I went to
Catholic school for 13 years.

00:48:53.865 --> 00:48:59.404 align:middle line:84%
I was taught all about the Bible
and religion and, of course,

00:48:59.404 --> 00:49:02.306 align:middle line:84%
the Catholic Church is
just, it is the source

00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:05.743 align:middle line:84%
of all the Christian
sects, the Protestants,

00:49:05.743 --> 00:49:07.612 align:middle line:90%
etcetera, all came from that.

00:49:07.612 --> 00:49:09.580 align:middle line:90%
And so the way that --

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.850 align:middle line:84%
but I never learned
in Catholic school,

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:14.252 align:middle line:90%
and I took religion classes.

00:49:14.252 --> 00:49:18.089 align:middle line:84%
I had to. I never learned
about the history of the church

00:49:18.089 --> 00:49:21.426 align:middle line:84%
or the history of the Bible,
other than Jesus said "Peter,

00:49:21.426 --> 00:49:26.064 align:middle line:84%
you're my rock," and it's like
Jesus invented the church,

00:49:26.064 --> 00:49:31.903 align:middle line:84%
but really until 325 AD there
was no consolidated Roman

00:49:31.903 --> 00:49:34.839 align:middle line:84%
Catholic Church, and
there was no Bible

00:49:34.839 --> 00:49:38.309 align:middle line:84%
and those books got voted
on at the Council of Nicea

00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:41.979 align:middle line:84%
in the 300s, and there
was a lot of candidates

00:49:41.979 --> 00:49:43.748 align:middle line:84%
for different canons
in the Bible

00:49:43.748 --> 00:49:44.949 align:middle line:90%
that were actually destroyed

00:49:44.949 --> 00:49:46.851 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
make the cut.

00:49:46.851 --> 00:49:49.220 align:middle line:90%
Like, for instance, Revelations.

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:50.655 align:middle line:84%
The Revelations that
we have now,

00:49:50.655 --> 00:49:53.357 align:middle line:90%
the Revelations of John -- wow.

00:49:53.357 --> 00:49:57.361 align:middle line:90%
That is one crazy book.

00:49:57.361 --> 00:50:00.231 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nobody's ever been
able to really interpret it

00:50:00.231 --> 00:50:02.834 align:middle line:90%
until the 19th century, and kind

00:50:02.834 --> 00:50:05.269 align:middle line:84%
of this one fundamentalist
sect came

00:50:05.269 --> 00:50:07.171 align:middle line:84%
up with a way of
interpreting it,

00:50:07.171 --> 00:50:10.508 align:middle line:84%
which has been carried
forward in recent times

00:50:10.508 --> 00:50:12.944 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we have this
whole Left Behind series

00:50:12.944 --> 00:50:15.913 align:middle line:84%
of books which has got all
these horrible predictions

00:50:15.913 --> 00:50:17.315 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:50:17.315 --> 00:50:19.684 align:middle line:84%
All these horrible predictions
of how your neighbors are going

00:50:19.684 --> 00:50:21.519 align:middle line:84%
to be left behind and
they're going to be --

00:50:21.519 --> 00:50:24.455 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is going to come
back as a raging warrior

00:50:24.455 --> 00:50:27.425 align:middle line:84%
in a fiery chariot and
he's going to smite people.

00:50:27.425 --> 00:50:30.461 align:middle line:84%
You know, that doesn't seem
in character for Jesus to me.

00:50:30.461 --> 00:50:33.397 align:middle line:84%
But the point I was trying to
make is that back in the day,

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:38.002 align:middle line:84%
in the 300s, there was the
Apocalypse of Saint Peter,

00:50:38.002 --> 00:50:42.673 align:middle line:84%
and they chose the
Apocalypse of Saint John

00:50:42.673 --> 00:50:45.042 align:middle line:84%
over the Apocalypse
of Saint Peter.

00:50:45.042 --> 00:50:47.712 align:middle line:84%
The Apocalypse of Saint Peter
is a very different story.

00:50:47.712 --> 00:50:53.818 align:middle line:84%
In that one, at the end of
time, at the end of the world,

00:50:53.818 --> 00:50:58.589 align:middle line:84%
the people in heaven ask
God if He, they entreat God

00:50:58.589 --> 00:51:01.926 align:middle line:84%
to forgive the people in hell
so that we can all be together

00:51:01.926 --> 00:51:06.797 align:middle line:84%
in heaven and God says,
"Okay," and it's a happy ending.

00:51:06.797 --> 00:51:07.899 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one
they destroyed.

00:51:07.899 --> 00:51:09.233 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: That didn't make the cut

00:51:09.233 --> 00:51:12.236 align:middle line:84%
and where it seemed there might
be some need of the Church

00:51:12.236 --> 00:51:14.172 align:middle line:84%
that had to be met
in the selections

00:51:14.172 --> 00:51:15.106 align:middle line:84%
of what was going
to make the cut.

00:51:15.106 --> 00:51:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: It occurs to me --

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.009 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Certainly triumphed
over the needs of the people.

00:51:18.009 --> 00:51:22.647 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Yeah, we don't really
know the, how that debate went.

00:51:22.647 --> 00:51:26.817 align:middle line:84%
But after it got destroyed, in
fact, nobody knew it existed

00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:29.554 align:middle line:84%
until it turned up in
some of these scrolls

00:51:29.554 --> 00:51:31.589 align:middle line:90%
that they found in Egypt.

00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:34.458 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it was the Dead
Sea Scrolls or there was a bunch

00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:37.795 align:middle line:84%
of scrolls they found within
the last hundred years

00:51:37.795 --> 00:51:39.997 align:middle line:90%
and they found it.

00:51:39.997 --> 00:51:41.766 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazing.

00:51:41.766 --> 00:51:43.134 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Indeed.

00:51:43.134 --> 00:51:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into some practical
parts of the divination now.

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:50.675 align:middle line:84%
How does a person then
pose the question?

00:51:50.675 --> 00:51:53.578 align:middle line:84%
Just some really basics now
if people are intrigued enough

00:51:53.578 --> 00:51:55.546 align:middle line:84%
to pull out their old
tarot deck they got

00:51:55.546 --> 00:51:58.015 align:middle line:84%
for their birthday a couple
of years ago or whatnot.

00:51:58.015 --> 00:51:59.784 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:51:59.784 --> 00:52:01.018 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Yeah, yeah.

00:52:01.018 --> 00:52:02.853 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a very
important question, Regina,

00:52:02.853 --> 00:52:05.256 align:middle line:84%
and I'm glad you brought
that up, because a lot

00:52:05.256 --> 00:52:08.292 align:middle line:84%
of times people will ask
the wrong kind of question.

00:52:08.292 --> 00:52:12.296 align:middle line:84%
And it's like I say: "You
wouldn't ask the plumber

00:52:12.296 --> 00:52:15.132 align:middle line:90%
for investment advice.

00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:17.335 align:middle line:84%
And you wouldn't ask
your investment advisor

00:52:17.335 --> 00:52:19.237 align:middle line:90%
for mechanical advice."

00:52:19.237 --> 00:52:20.771 align:middle line:84%
You've got to ask the
right kind of question

00:52:20.771 --> 00:52:22.440 align:middle line:90%
for the right kind of resource.

00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:24.809 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to a divination
system like the I Ching

00:52:24.809 --> 00:52:28.012 align:middle line:84%
or tarot cards, you
want to phrase your --

00:52:28.012 --> 00:52:31.015 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to ask a
question that's asking for data,

00:52:31.015 --> 00:52:33.618 align:middle line:84%
like "Where should
I go to lunch,"

00:52:33.618 --> 00:52:35.953 align:middle line:90%
or "What's the meaning of life?"

00:52:35.953 --> 00:52:40.424 align:middle line:84%
You ask a question that's going
to give you some kind of advice

00:52:40.424 --> 00:52:43.527 align:middle line:84%
and some kind of
insight and maybe an idea

00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:45.696 align:middle line:90%
of the way things are headed.

00:52:45.696 --> 00:52:48.232 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want to ask a
question about what's going

00:52:48.232 --> 00:52:50.601 align:middle line:84%
to happen in the future because
that's another question asking

00:52:50.601 --> 00:52:51.602 align:middle line:90%
for data.

00:52:51.602 --> 00:52:53.404 align:middle line:90%
And you still have free will.

00:52:53.404 --> 00:52:55.773 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen in the
future depends on what you do.

00:52:55.773 --> 00:52:58.242 align:middle line:84%
So what you're trying to do
is stimulate your intuition

00:52:58.242 --> 00:53:00.845 align:middle line:84%
to make a better decision
in the present moment.

00:53:00.845 --> 00:53:03.447 align:middle line:84%
So the typical kind of
question that I advise people

00:53:03.447 --> 00:53:10.521 align:middle line:84%
to use would be what's the best
approach to take vis-a-vis x?

00:53:10.521 --> 00:53:13.157 align:middle line:90%
It could be a person's name.

00:53:13.157 --> 00:53:14.959 align:middle line:90%
It could be my relationship.

00:53:14.959 --> 00:53:17.795 align:middle line:90%
It could be asking for a raise.

00:53:17.795 --> 00:53:21.832 align:middle line:84%
So what's the best approach
to take toward asking

00:53:21.832 --> 00:53:24.068 align:middle line:90%
for a raise right now?

00:53:24.068 --> 00:53:27.738 align:middle line:84%
And you might get a response
that says, "Don't go there."

00:53:27.738 --> 00:53:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Or you might get a
response that indicates --

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.009 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to tell you
that flat out, but you have to,

00:53:32.009 --> 00:53:33.044 align:middle line:84%
then you have to
interpret the cards.

00:53:33.044 --> 00:53:36.047 align:middle line:84%
So the real -- or
the I Ching reading.

00:53:36.047 --> 00:53:39.216 align:middle line:84%
So the real power of a
divination reading is not

00:53:39.216 --> 00:53:42.520 align:middle line:84%
in the literal words
that it tells you.

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:46.057 align:middle line:84%
It's the reading between
the lines filtered

00:53:46.057 --> 00:53:48.459 align:middle line:90%
by the question that you asked.

00:53:48.459 --> 00:53:50.194 align:middle line:84%
So if you ask an
inappropriate question,

00:53:50.194 --> 00:53:52.697 align:middle line:84%
you've got a filter that's
not going to work very well,

00:53:52.697 --> 00:53:54.999 align:middle line:90%
and you're liable to be misled

00:53:54.999 --> 00:53:58.336 align:middle line:84%
or misinterpret what
it's trying to tell you.

00:53:58.336 --> 00:54:00.338 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: What if you then
get the information,

00:54:00.338 --> 00:54:03.974 align:middle line:84%
you've asked it wisely, you've
taken a little distance from it,

00:54:03.974 --> 00:54:07.511 align:middle line:84%
and you don't like what it
says so you just reject it?

00:54:07.511 --> 00:54:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you try
to throw the coins

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:12.149 align:middle line:90%
or lay the cards out again.

00:54:12.149 --> 00:54:15.419 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is that doing to
your relationship with yourself

00:54:15.419 --> 00:54:16.287 align:middle line:90%
and your own intuitive forces?

00:54:16.287 --> 00:54:17.755 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Well, I mean, that's okay.

00:54:17.755 --> 00:54:19.056 align:middle line:90%
You can do whatever you want.

00:54:19.056 --> 00:54:23.227 align:middle line:84%
It's going to reflect
back relative to the level

00:54:23.227 --> 00:54:26.297 align:middle line:84%
of your seriousness and
sincerity and your intention,

00:54:26.297 --> 00:54:28.899 align:middle line:84%
like my original
story indicated.

00:54:28.899 --> 00:54:33.838 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't take it
seriously, you're not going

00:54:33.838 --> 00:54:35.573 align:middle line:90%
to get a serious answer.

00:54:35.573 --> 00:54:37.842 align:middle line:84%
If you get an answer that you
don't like, my recommendation is

00:54:37.842 --> 00:54:41.879 align:middle line:84%
that you take a day or two
and just sort of like see if,

00:54:41.879 --> 00:54:44.582 align:middle line:90%
and play with it, toy with it.

00:54:44.582 --> 00:54:45.883 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:54:45.883 --> 00:54:48.018 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Take it seriously;
give it some gravitas.

00:54:48.018 --> 00:54:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Yeah, sleep on it

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:53.424 align:middle line:84%
and consider whether
there's an aspect of it

00:54:53.424 --> 00:54:56.961 align:middle line:84%
that you're not seeing clearly
because of your attachment

00:54:56.961 --> 00:54:59.163 align:middle line:90%
to what you wanted to hear.

00:54:59.163 --> 00:55:01.899 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Because it seems that
if you're one of these people

00:55:01.899 --> 00:55:05.870 align:middle line:84%
that are tossing the coins every
few moments that ultimately,

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:07.972 align:middle line:84%
that kind of connection
is really not going

00:55:07.972 --> 00:55:09.073 align:middle line:90%
to be enhanced...

00:55:09.073 --> 00:55:10.975 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Yeah, it's not
going to be meaningful.

00:55:10.975 --> 00:55:12.376 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: It won't be
meaningful at all to you.

00:55:12.376 --> 00:55:15.746 align:middle line:84%
And you also say that at this
point in time, we really need

00:55:15.746 --> 00:55:18.716 align:middle line:84%
to have clearer and
better decision-making.

00:55:18.716 --> 00:55:21.285 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Oh, more than ever, yeah.

00:55:21.285 --> 00:55:26.891 align:middle line:84%
Because we live in a chaotic,
increasingly chaotic world.

00:55:26.891 --> 00:55:28.726 align:middle line:84%
We've got so many
decisions to make.

00:55:28.726 --> 00:55:34.999 align:middle line:84%
We have to make more important
personal decisions in a year

00:55:34.999 --> 00:55:37.601 align:middle line:84%
than our grandparents probably
had to make in 10 years.

00:55:37.601 --> 00:55:39.103 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have the mobility.

00:55:39.103 --> 00:55:41.138 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
all the information.

00:55:41.138 --> 00:55:44.074 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have the urgency,
and things didn't seem

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:45.676 align:middle line:90%
to be changing as fast.

00:55:45.676 --> 00:55:50.514 align:middle line:84%
We have this accelerating rate
of change that's getting worse.

00:55:50.514 --> 00:55:52.883 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to slow down.

00:55:52.883 --> 00:55:56.487 align:middle line:84%
So we have to, we need all
the help that we can get

00:55:56.487 --> 00:56:00.291 align:middle line:84%
to make decisions, and
in fact in some areas --

00:56:00.291 --> 00:56:03.127 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we --
decision-making is so important.

00:56:03.127 --> 00:56:07.998 align:middle line:84%
That's why we reward politicians
and CEOs with so much power

00:56:07.998 --> 00:56:10.100 align:middle line:90%
and wealth to make them for us.

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:12.436 align:middle line:84%
To make them for society because
it's such an important --

00:56:12.436 --> 00:56:14.104 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Well, that's gotten
us somewhere, hasn't it?

00:56:14.104 --> 00:56:15.606 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Well yeah, they're
not doing very good.

00:56:15.606 --> 00:56:18.776 align:middle line:84%
I think they should
be using the I Ching.

00:56:18.776 --> 00:56:21.378 align:middle line:84%
But, so decision-making
is incredibly important

00:56:21.378 --> 00:56:25.716 align:middle line:84%
and we're dealing with more,
with a faster rate of change

00:56:25.716 --> 00:56:28.352 align:middle line:84%
and more things that
can go wrong,

00:56:28.352 --> 00:56:30.588 align:middle line:90%
and there's more at stake.

00:56:30.588 --> 00:56:35.826 align:middle line:84%
The whole survival of the planet
is at stake on some levels.

00:56:35.826 --> 00:56:37.495 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's critically
important

00:56:37.495 --> 00:56:39.029 align:middle line:84%
that we learn how
to do this better.

00:56:39.029 --> 00:56:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: So it seems that makes
it much more efficient because,

00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:46.504 align:middle line:84%
as you say, these decisions are
coming at us by the moment now.

00:56:46.504 --> 00:56:48.672 align:middle line:84%
I mean, small decisions
to large.

00:56:48.672 --> 00:56:49.807 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: There's too
many choices, too.

00:56:49.807 --> 00:56:51.275 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: As you say, the
mobility and everything,

00:56:51.275 --> 00:56:53.210 align:middle line:84%
the chance to connect
and move around,

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:55.646 align:middle line:84%
to make different
kinds of decisions.

00:56:55.646 --> 00:56:59.016 align:middle line:84%
It seems like if you have
some form of divination,

00:56:59.016 --> 00:57:01.819 align:middle line:84%
it just makes it efficient
so we don't go into a pattern

00:57:01.819 --> 00:57:04.688 align:middle line:84%
of avoidance; because
overwhelm creates avoidance

00:57:04.688 --> 00:57:05.890 align:middle line:90%
for the most part, right?

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:07.725 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Right, exactly.

00:57:07.725 --> 00:57:09.994 align:middle line:84%
You can get into a
state of paralysis

00:57:09.994 --> 00:57:12.696 align:middle line:84%
where you don't do
anything at all.

00:57:12.696 --> 00:57:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's like --
there's two ways that...

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.903 align:middle line:90%
people, the two most common ways

00:57:18.903 --> 00:57:21.939 align:middle line:84%
that people make bad decision
is either they're too emotional

00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:25.209 align:middle line:90%
or they're overly analytical.

00:57:25.209 --> 00:57:27.611 align:middle line:90%
Now the overly analytical types,

00:57:27.611 --> 00:57:30.214 align:middle line:84%
they'll just keep waiting
for more information.

00:57:30.214 --> 00:57:32.316 align:middle line:84%
And if there's a
window of opportunity --

00:57:32.316 --> 00:57:34.485 align:middle line:84%
and these windows of opportunity
change faster now, too.

00:57:34.485 --> 00:57:35.753 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right, they're opening

00:57:35.753 --> 00:57:37.154 align:middle line:84%
and closing while they're
still analyzing the data.

00:57:37.154 --> 00:57:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Exactly, and so they'll
miss the window of opportunity

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and then they need to start over
and get even more information.

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:47.731 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, we have to strike
while the iron is hot.

00:57:47.731 --> 00:57:49.133 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And as a result
of all that,

00:57:49.133 --> 00:57:53.137 align:middle line:84%
you say that divination is more
popular than it's ever been.

00:57:53.137 --> 00:57:54.371 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: Yeah, I think that's why.

00:57:54.371 --> 00:57:56.340 align:middle line:84%
I think it's because people
are looking for meaning

00:57:56.340 --> 00:58:00.177 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking for help in
this area of knowing what to do.

00:58:00.177 --> 00:58:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is that we're
moving from what's called

00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:07.051 align:middle line:84%
in astrology the Piscean Age
into the Aquarian Age, okay?

00:58:07.051 --> 00:58:12.756 align:middle line:84%
And so in the Piscean Age it was
all about devotion and about --

00:58:12.756 --> 00:58:15.793 align:middle line:84%
which supported hierarchy
because it really wasn't

00:58:15.793 --> 00:58:17.394 align:middle line:90%
about being intellectual.

00:58:17.394 --> 00:58:20.798 align:middle line:84%
It was more about
heartfelt devotion and...

00:58:20.798 --> 00:58:23.567 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: To something
exterior to you.

00:58:23.567 --> 00:58:27.805 align:middle line:84%
>>PO: Right, and so what you
believed was you basically were

00:58:27.805 --> 00:58:30.874 align:middle line:84%
told what to believe because
it didn't seem as important

00:58:30.874 --> 00:58:34.945 align:middle line:84%
as how you felt in
your devotional nature.

00:58:34.945 --> 00:58:35.746 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: That's changed.

00:58:35.746 --> 00:58:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>PO: That's changing.

00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:38.015 align:middle line:84%
Now we're entering
the Age of Aquarius.

00:58:38.015 --> 00:58:40.718 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius is a more
intellectual sign.

00:58:40.718 --> 00:58:43.220 align:middle line:84%
It's dwelling in
the world of ideas,

00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:47.891 align:middle line:84%
and it's more equalitarian,
too, and more humanitarian.

00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:50.461 align:middle line:84%
So it's got a flatter
structure to everything whereas

00:58:50.461 --> 00:58:53.864 align:middle line:84%
in the last 2,000 years we've
had hierarchical structures

00:58:53.864 --> 00:58:56.100 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to church and
government and business;

00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:57.835 align:middle line:84%
and now we're seeing
this flattening thing.

00:58:57.835 --> 00:59:00.237 align:middle line:84%
And I like to think
that divination is a way

00:59:00.237 --> 00:59:03.540 align:middle line:84%
of flattening things on the
spiritual and religious front,

00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:06.110 align:middle line:84%
because it gives
you direct access.

00:59:06.110 --> 00:59:08.379 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go
through the hierarchy

00:59:08.379 --> 00:59:11.215 align:middle line:84%
and be judged by
what you believe.

00:59:11.215 --> 00:59:12.583 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:59:12.583 --> 00:59:15.019 align:middle line:84%
And on that note, we're going
to be discovering some more

00:59:15.019 --> 00:59:17.221 align:middle line:84%
about all of the
different systems.

00:59:17.221 --> 00:59:20.290 align:middle line:84%
I thank you for this, and we
will continue our conversation.

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:22.926 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be continuing
by going deeper into the value

00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:25.863 align:middle line:84%
of each of the disciplines,
and it's up to us to discover

00:59:25.863 --> 00:59:27.598 align:middle line:90%
which one works best for us.

00:59:27.598 --> 00:59:31.301 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
