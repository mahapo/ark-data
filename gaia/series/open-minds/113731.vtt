00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:30.450 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Certainly one
of the most profound landmarks

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.650 align:middle line:10%
in our lives is that
of becoming a parent.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And we've all heard
the comment, you

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:84%
should have to get a
license to have a kid,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.920 align:middle line:84%
when witnessing
unconscious parenting.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.030 align:middle line:84%
While licensing might
not go down well,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.740 align:middle line:90%
a little education should.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.277 align:middle line:84%
How many of our world's
woes would be healed just

00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:46.860 align:middle line:84%
through the process
of bringing people

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:84%
into the world in
a conscious way,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.890 align:middle line:84%
helping them live
a conscious life?

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Toward that end, we're speaking
with Catherine Shainberg today.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Catherine.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.220 align:middle line:84%
You've made a life out
of helping people birth

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.321 align:middle line:90%
their children consciously.

00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CATHERINE SHAINBERG:
I've made part of my life

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.929 align:middle line:90%
out of doing that.

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you have
a 40-year history so far

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:90%
of helping people in general.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's give a little
bit of your background

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.962 align:middle line:84%
so our audience can
get to know you a bit.

00:01:11.962 --> 00:01:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: All right.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:10%
So I am an art historian,
but I'm also a psychologist.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:10%
But I really am
much more than that.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.450 align:middle line:10%
I don't do therapy.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.710 align:middle line:10%
I really teach people how to
plunge into their subconscious

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:10%
and understand
what are the deeper

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.170 align:middle line:10%
motivations in their lives.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.670 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious is
what moves the body

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and helps the body to
adjust to the environment.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.040 align:middle line:84%
So I work with the
subconscious and with dreaming.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I work with visualization
and with imagery.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.550 align:middle line:84%
These are different processes
that we can talk about

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.772 align:middle line:84%
if you want when we talk
about the birthing issues.

00:01:53.772 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
we'll get into that.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And your degree, your
PhD, is in psychology.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.180 align:middle line:84%
What made you go this
direction into the world

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.500 align:middle line:90%
of imagery and dreaming?

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: I've
always been an imager.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.190 align:middle line:90%
I've always been a dreamer.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually searching
for the outer manifestations

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.010 align:middle line:90%
of what I was doing.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.030 align:middle line:84%
How images move people
was my interest.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.854 align:middle line:84%
I went into art history
because paintings--

00:02:20.854 --> 00:02:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, your natural
connection with imagery

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.996 align:middle line:90%
makes total sense.

00:02:23.996 --> 00:02:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Exactly.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.250 align:middle line:84%
But what I was really,
really interested

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.390 align:middle line:84%
in-- if I, let's
say, took a Matisse

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and took away the
lemon in the Matisse,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.530 align:middle line:84%
it would affect a
person's perceptions

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.920 align:middle line:90%
and change the person's being.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, yes.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.631 align:middle line:90%
That's very clever.

00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: And so that
really, really interested me.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know how
I could really apply that.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let me
ask you a question.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
have an answer to that.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.020 align:middle line:84%
It's not anything
that you've written

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:90%
about that I am aware of.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.220 align:middle line:84%
As an art historian, did
you ever witness various art

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.270 align:middle line:84%
throughout the ages that had
to do with the birthing process

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.060 align:middle line:84%
and notice some really
critical differences of how

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.210 align:middle line:84%
things were handled in ancient
times, or in the past, to now?

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Practically nothing
on the birthing experience.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.293 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I was wondering.

00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:15.190 align:middle line:90%
I can't think of it.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.773 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: No,
there's practically--

00:03:16.773 --> 00:03:18.770 align:middle line:84%
there are lots of
mothers and child's.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.825 align:middle line:90%
Of course, the Madonna--

00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:21.325 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
religious iconography.

00:03:21.325 --> 00:03:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Yes, the
religious iconography.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But no, there's
nothing about birthing.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And birthing really
was the domain of women

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.110 align:middle line:90%
until maybe the 16th century.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So men
weren't allowed in.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.374 align:middle line:84%
The artists of the day,
which were dominantly male,

00:03:36.374 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:84%
were not really allowed to
even witness the process.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Not at all.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.242 align:middle line:90%
It was really a private--

00:03:40.242 --> 00:03:42.283 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's really
not a lot of history.

00:03:42.283 --> 00:03:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: --mystery
of the women.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.753 align:middle line:84%
So it's really what's
been handed down

00:03:45.753 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:90%
through wives' tales and lore.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Right.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to make
a little note here

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't planning
on asking about this,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.200 align:middle line:90%
but it's popping to mind.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.881 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what you do when
you're working with people--

00:03:59.881 --> 00:04:02.130 align:middle line:84%
let's just get a little
background before the birthing

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.020 align:middle line:84%
These same techniques can
work in someone's life

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:84%
for enhancing their performance
in sports, for their challenges

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.000 align:middle line:90%
with finances or money.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.160 align:middle line:84%
These are broad-based
techniques really,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.974 align:middle line:84%
even though we're
applying them now

00:04:18.974 --> 00:04:20.640 align:middle line:84%
into the birthing
process because you've

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:90%
done so much in this area.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG:
Everybody has a mind

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:84%
that creates images, and
has a mind, of course,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.840 align:middle line:90%
that creates words.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
language in the brain

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.360 align:middle line:90%
that is the language of images.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:84%
That is you
experiencing the world,

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and you reflected back into
yourself through images.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.210 align:middle line:84%
These images are very
powerful, and we've

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.500 align:middle line:90%
lost contact with them.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Now it's beginning to be of
interest to psychologists,

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and sports psychologists
use it all the time

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Olympic athletes are trained
to practice, let's say,

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.490 align:middle line:90%
their ski descent.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.600 align:middle line:84%
If they do that-- let's say
I'm skiing down the slope.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm activating micro
movements in the body.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.060 align:middle line:90%
This is how my body moves.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I see an apple, and without even
being aware or conscious of it,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.510 align:middle line:84%
my mind has gone,
apple, hand, take.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, you
start maybe salivating.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: I wanted actually
to give that as an example.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.660 align:middle line:84%
For example, you can imagine
that you're in your kitchen

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:90%
and you cut a lemon in two.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.922 align:middle line:84%
If you imagine
that, what happens?

00:05:42.922 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you
start salivating.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: You
start salivating.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.165 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also
you might have

00:05:47.165 --> 00:05:51.470 align:middle line:84%
an upliftment of energy just
from imagining the scent.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Absolutely.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's through the senses
that we activate the body.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to talk about
a larger aspect of the body.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.750 align:middle line:84%
But the senses are the ones
that give the imaginal will

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.820 align:middle line:90%
inside of you its directions.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:84%
So if I cut the lemon in
my imagination, I smell it.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.410 align:middle line:84%
It starts salivating
inside of me.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.530 align:middle line:84%
This means that I can,
if I have precise images,

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:84%
move anything I want
to move in the body.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and affect
your external world.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.020 align:middle line:84%
I was watching a really
silly movie recently,

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.600 align:middle line:84%
one of those where you
just want to go brain dead.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.510 align:middle line:90%
And in it, monks were bowling.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Tibetan monks were
at a bowling alley.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And their competition
were some very aggressive

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.740 align:middle line:84%
American males--
you know, jocks.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And the monks closed their eyes,
stood at the front of the lane,

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.980 align:middle line:84%
and just imagined the
ball going into the pins,

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.179 align:middle line:90%
of course, and bowling.

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And it would take
a circuitous route,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:84%
but they always ended up
knocking down all the pins,

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.300 align:middle line:90%
getting a streak.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I wonder if
that's something that actually

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:84%
came from a real experience
that the director or the writer

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.580 align:middle line:84%
was tapping into,
because these are

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.800 align:middle line:90%
the things we're capable of.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Absolutely.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have
an old book called

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.410 align:middle line:90%
"The Art of Zen Archery."

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's
right, a very good book.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.846 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: And
the way it's done

00:07:23.846 --> 00:07:25.750 align:middle line:84%
is you visualize
your arrow going

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.350 align:middle line:90%
into the center of the target.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.190 align:middle line:90%
You close your eyes.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.197 align:middle line:90%
You pull the arrow.

00:07:30.197 --> 00:07:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and this has been
around for quite a long time.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.890 align:middle line:84%
But how many of us
actually do that?

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.602 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Thousands of years.

00:07:36.602 --> 00:07:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thousands of years.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But today, even
though we've had,

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.860 align:middle line:84%
what, 30, 40-year
run at it now for all

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.410 align:middle line:84%
of these concepts in the
new thinking movement,

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.420 align:middle line:84%
we still don't take
advantage of it.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Well,
because first we've

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.120 align:middle line:84%
had the scientific revolution,
which kind of pulled people

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.270 align:middle line:90%
away from how you use images.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.900 align:middle line:84%
It was known in the past
how you used images.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.790 align:middle line:84%
But also because
many people have used

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.690 align:middle line:90%
what I call visualizations.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.450 align:middle line:84%
They're very simple
storytelling lines.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:11.550 align:middle line:90%
You go down the path.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:12.390 align:middle line:90%
You turn right.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.270 align:middle line:90%
You're going to see this.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:84%
But really the
power of image comes

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.240 align:middle line:84%
from giving it
just a little jolt

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.440 align:middle line:84%
so that the body will move
the way it needs to move,

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.484 align:middle line:84%
not the way you have
decided to make it move.

00:08:28.484 --> 00:08:30.567 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it has
its own intelligence that

00:08:30.567 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:90%
knows how to best do that.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: It has its own
alignment and intelligence.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.737 align:middle line:84%
And each one of us is
slightly different.

00:08:36.737 --> 00:08:38.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, I have a question.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.612 align:middle line:84%
Have you come across people who
have no ability to visualize?

00:08:41.612 --> 00:08:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Yes.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then what?

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.462 align:middle line:90%
How do you work with them?

00:08:44.462 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Well,
there are little

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.920 align:middle line:84%
exercises that I give them
that are very, very simple.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.170 align:middle line:90%
99% of them can do it.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:58.510 align:middle line:84%
I've met one or two
who really could not.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:84%
But they dream at night, so
I'd point that out to them.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.174 align:middle line:90%
It's like an intellectual block.

00:09:03.174 --> 00:09:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's also
what I was going to say.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it has to be a block.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.631 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Yes.

00:09:07.631 --> 00:09:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so--

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: And I
just wanted to say--

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: The
way that you really

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.420 align:middle line:84%
work with people like that
is you have five senses.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.400 align:middle line:90%
There may be another road.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:84%
We use the sight because
it's the most complete

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.370 align:middle line:90%
of our senses.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.420 align:middle line:90%
It incorporates the other four.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:84%
But I could use touch for
them, or smell, or sound.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that will change
something for them

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.870 align:middle line:84%
because their access
to the subconscious

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.040 align:middle line:84%
may be through,
let's say, sound.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is well-known
in the field of hypnotherapy.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.361 align:middle line:84%
When you're trying
to guide a person,

00:09:46.361 --> 00:09:48.520 align:middle line:84%
it might be they're
totally kinesthetic.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.160 align:middle line:90%
They can't see.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.250 align:middle line:90%
They can't hear.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.696 align:middle line:84%
But they can feel everything
going on and gain information.

00:09:53.696 --> 00:09:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Exactly.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Accurate information
through the process

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.300 align:middle line:90%
of just feeling.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: And it's very
important to hear the word

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:05.680 align:middle line:84%
"in-for-mation" because
it's form, it's pattern,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.630 align:middle line:90%
that the brain is interested in.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.700 align:middle line:90%
That's how it makes meaning.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:84%
So if I touch this
cup, it's round.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And this creates
information inside of me.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So through the anthroposophical
movement and others,

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.800 align:middle line:84%
lots of experimentation have
been done in color labs.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And labs were
using simple forms.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:90%
And what they do to the mind.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And one of the protocols
in the Waldorf education,

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.880 align:middle line:84%
for example, that I
always appreciated

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.580 align:middle line:90%
is with little children.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Until the age of something
like 8 or 9, 10 years old,

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.600 align:middle line:84%
all of the corners
are cut off the paper.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a
rounded field for them

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.830 align:middle line:90%
to create in on that paper.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:84%
So conceptually, why
would you suppose--

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.300 align:middle line:84%
what kind of difference
would that make to a child?

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Well,
if it's rounded,

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:84%
they have an experience
of what rounded means.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.650 align:middle line:84%
It's much more receptive,
the rounded space,

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.330 align:middle line:84%
because there are many,
many, many more points.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.615 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if it's a straight
line, it's much more cutting.

00:11:16.615 --> 00:11:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, right angles.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Right angles
will be more cutting.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know why the Waldorf
people have chosen to do that.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.720 align:middle line:84%
But I would imagine that it's
to harmonize their space.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
because also Steiner

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.940 align:middle line:84%
was not into right
angles in his buildings.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.430 align:middle line:84%
He had interlocking domes that
appeared to be free standing.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.350 align:middle line:90%
It burned down, but interesting.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.890 align:middle line:84%
But again, the whole notion
of being in spaces that

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.250 align:middle line:84%
expand consciousness
versus experimentation.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.060 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can do this.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Just look at a blue square
versus a blue circle,

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.520 align:middle line:84%
and we have a very
different impact in our mind

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.120 align:middle line:90%
and how it feels in the body.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Well,
actually I teach that.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.260 align:middle line:10%
I teach what I call
morphology, which

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.220 align:middle line:10%
is the shape of the human body.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And we inhabit the
simple shapes of nature.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:12.910 align:middle line:84%
We inhabit squares, rectangles,
circles, ovals, like an egg.

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And this means that the one
who inhabits, let's say,

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:20.640 align:middle line:84%
the egg-shaped face has
a different experience

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.920 align:middle line:84%
of life than the one who's going
to inhabit the square shape.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Because if you put
yourself in a square shape,

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.990 align:middle line:84%
you'll see everything is a
little hard, a little harsh.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:38.030 align:middle line:84%
If you're in the egg shape,
you have a much softer

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.610 align:middle line:90%
relationship.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So for example, what
we call the Venus type

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.140 align:middle line:90%
inhabits an egg shape.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And she's sweet, and loves
beauty, and is feminine.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the square
shape is very--

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More Mars.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: More masculine.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:02.370 align:middle line:10%
Maybe if it's a little bit more
rectangular, it'll be a Mars.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a more
aggressive side to the line.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
If you think of a
line, it cuts through.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.650 align:middle line:84%
If you think of a
curve, it envelops.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.505 align:middle line:90%
And it touches a lot of things.

00:13:15.505 --> 00:13:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
interesting because you're

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.490 align:middle line:84%
dealing with all types
in the birthing process,

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:20.790 align:middle line:90%
all different kinds of mothers.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Absolutely.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.581 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you
would have to approach

00:13:23.581 --> 00:13:26.866 align:middle line:84%
the woman with a more square-set
face versus an oval shape

00:13:26.866 --> 00:13:28.240 align:middle line:84%
very differently,
I would assume.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Totally.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So the birth professionals
who've studied with me

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:37.200 align:middle line:84%
have studied this so that they
know who they're talking to.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're able to talk to
that woman in a way which

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.590 align:middle line:90%
fits her morphology.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.180 align:middle line:84%
That makes it much
easier for the woman

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:50.644 align:middle line:84%
to begin to process
what's going through her.

00:13:50.644 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's talk
about you personally.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.790 align:middle line:84%
You ended up on this
path rather unexpectedly

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:57.520 align:middle line:90%
when you went in for an exam.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And here you are at
41, pregnant, right?

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Well, I've
always done the imagery.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And I studied with a
very great woman teacher

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:14.940 align:middle line:84%
in Israel, one of the few women
Kabbalists in the Jewish world.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.760 align:middle line:90%
And she was teaching that.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was led to her
by dreaming, really.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:22.990 align:middle line:90%
I left everything I was doing.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:25.450 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to be in Harvard,
and I ended up in Israel,

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.460 align:middle line:90%
studying with her.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.390 align:middle line:90%
So I was meant to do this work.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:35.540 align:middle line:84%
When I got pregnant
at 41, I had not

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.590 align:middle line:84%
expected that,
although I had always

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.900 align:middle line:90%
heard my son calling to me.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I'd heard the child
calling, Mom, Mom,

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.740 align:middle line:90%
when are you going to be ready?

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.100 align:middle line:90%
In dreams or in waking?

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: In
dreams and in waking.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:90%
He was always in the background.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.630 align:middle line:84%
I always knew it was a boy,
and I always heard him calling.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And I felt maybe life has
decided to change that.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.870 align:middle line:90%
But it was still there.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:09.510 align:middle line:84%
So I was surprised and not
surprised when he did come.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And I applied all of my work
first to the conception,

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:22.400 align:middle line:84%
because I asked the question
before I was pregnant.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.830 align:middle line:90%
I felt, I'm 41.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.190 align:middle line:90%
It's time to ask this question.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Do I really want a child?

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.440 align:middle line:90%
My husband was a little older.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:90%
He'd had another family.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.580 align:middle line:90%
It was an iffy question.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, bringing a lot of
energy into a settled kind

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:40.425 align:middle line:90%
of life, so to speak.

00:15:40.425 --> 00:15:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Exactly.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:90%
And so I asked the question.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And I created
actually an exercise

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:84%
that I have in my book on how
to ask a question every day

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:57.330 align:middle line:84%
until you get a question in
your mind, the right question.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Very important because
the right question is

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.470 align:middle line:90%
what triggers the subconscious.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.680 align:middle line:10%
So if I ask the
subconscious, well,

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.915 align:middle line:10%
what do you think about
that, the subconscious

00:16:08.915 --> 00:16:10.635 align:middle line:10%
is not going to move.

00:16:10.635 --> 00:16:13.340 align:middle line:84%
I have to find the
right question.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.680 align:middle line:90%
It's like fishing.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I have to throw the
line in the right place

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.380 align:middle line:90%
to get the right kind of fish.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So I was fishing into my
subconscious to find out.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And the question that came to
me after every night closing

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:84%
my eyes for a minute
and asking, what

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:34.820 align:middle line:84%
is the right question about
this, I heard in French-- I'm

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.550 align:middle line:84%
French-- [SPEAKING FRENCH],
which means,

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.090 align:middle line:90%
will a child pop out of nowhere?

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And three weeks
later, I was pregnant.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.249 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:16:44.249 --> 00:16:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: I was
not only pregnant,

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:51.530 align:middle line:84%
but I had contraception that
should have stopped this.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your son
was determined.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: He was
determined to come.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And the question had
provoked the body.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.720 align:middle line:90%
And we were talking off-camera.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.630 align:middle line:84%
In a similar
situation, I was told

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.740 align:middle line:84%
from the time I was a
little girl I would never

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.329 align:middle line:90%
conceive or have children.

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And yet, for 12 years,
I had dreams of my son.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.599 align:middle line:84%
And the same scenario over
and over, to the point

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:17.420 align:middle line:90%
where I'd wake up.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.410 align:middle line:90%
I'd pinch myself.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:22.260 align:middle line:84%
In the dream, I would
believe I had awakened,

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.220 align:middle line:90%
and I'd pinch myself.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.220 align:middle line:90%
Ah, it's real this time.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes there'd
be layers and layers down

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.725 align:middle line:84%
in the dream before
I'd actually wake up.

00:17:29.725 --> 00:17:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'd done that
a couple times,

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.420 align:middle line:84%
saying, no, you
were tricked before.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.520 align:middle line:84%
You were actually
asleep, not awake.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And so when he came
into the world,

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:42.570 align:middle line:84%
he was exactly as I had
seen all of those years.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was as easy-- odd,
but as easy a birth--

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:84%
as I had seen in my
dreams over and over.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: The subconscious
lives in a no-time space.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Einstein talks about
the space-time.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.680 align:middle line:90%
It's a no-time space.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.120 align:middle line:90%
And therefore it knows.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.640 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the body is
much vaster than the limits

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.640 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.630 align:middle line:90%
And it knows.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.120 align:middle line:90%
It knows its future.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:90%
So it can see very clearly.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.790 align:middle line:84%
If we are clear inside,
if we are connected,

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:27.786 align:middle line:84%
it'll show us very clearly
what is supposed to happen.

00:18:27.786 --> 00:18:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you had
a visionary experience.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Once you decided to take this
whole area on in your career,

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.405 align:middle line:84%
you had a visionary
experience as you

00:18:34.405 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:84%
were about to
inaugurate some doulas.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Well, what
happened was I had my son.

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.856 align:middle line:90%
Everything happened the way I--

00:18:42.856 --> 00:18:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You saw it would.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: I saw it would.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:50.520 align:middle line:84%
He came out exactly the
way as your son did.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.610 align:middle line:90%


00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Many years later,
one of my students

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:59.930 align:middle line:84%
who was a doula, a woman who
accompanies women at birth--

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.180 align:middle line:90%
not a midwife, but a doula.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain the
difference between the two.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: The
midwife is medically

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:12.520 align:middle line:84%
allowed to facilitate the
birth, to be there at the birth.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.660 align:middle line:84%
The doula is a woman who
accompanies the mother

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:22.910 align:middle line:84%
to help her through the process
of birthing in a supportive

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:23.410 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But isn't
actually involved

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.560 align:middle line:84%
in bringing the body
of the baby out.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: No, and doesn't
do any of the manipulations.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a doula is
what we used to have.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.120 align:middle line:84%
We used to be surrounded
by the neighbors.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.890 align:middle line:90%
They'd come in.

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:40.832 align:middle line:84%
And they knew, well, certain
herbs would help with dilation,

00:19:40.832 --> 00:19:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and certain massages would
help the mother's back pain

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So they knew that, and
that's what the doula does.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so continue.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.374 align:middle line:84%
So there was a doula
in the group, and--

00:19:52.374 --> 00:19:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: There
was a doula who

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:56.955 align:middle line:90%
was my student, Claudia Raiken.

00:19:56.955 --> 00:19:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's a picture of
her in the book, actually.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me,
would you do this?

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.260 align:middle line:84%
If I put together a group
of birth professionals,

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.306 align:middle line:84%
would you use
imagery for birthing?

00:20:11.306 --> 00:20:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
have to think about it,

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:17.570 align:middle line:84%
because I had only done
that for my own son

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and for a few students
here and there.

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'll think
about it during the weekend.

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:27.005 align:middle line:84%
And that weekend, I
went off to an auction.

00:20:27.005 --> 00:20:28.710 align:middle line:90%
It was quite by chance.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I got to the auction, and quite
by chance-- I sat through it.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And there was there
a big African doll

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.470 align:middle line:90%
that I thought was very ugly.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:44.420 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason,
in my dreaming awake,

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.810 align:middle line:84%
she kept on waving at
me, buy me, buy me.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I finally
bought her for nothing,

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:84%
for $20, took her home,
put in her my entrance.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
next day a friend

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.530 align:middle line:90%
came by with an African dealer.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.577 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:21:05.577 --> 00:21:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: This just happened.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:90%
It was completely by chance.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.030 align:middle line:90%
And he completely flipped.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.990 align:middle line:84%
He said, you've
got a spirit doll.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:19.930 align:middle line:84%
You've got a
fertility doll that is

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:25.900 align:middle line:84%
given from mother to daughter
to help with a good birth.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How perfect is that?

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: How perfect.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.840 align:middle line:84%
The universe was talking to
me, you've got to do this.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
you were working,

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:84%
as we go into now the
birthing part itself,

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.230 align:middle line:84%
with a group of women
for seven years.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.939 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Yes.

00:21:41.939 --> 00:21:43.355 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
met once a week.

00:21:43.355 --> 00:21:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
how you gathered them

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle line:84%
together, and the nature of that
group, and what you produced?

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Well,
the group was gathered

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.310 align:middle line:84%
by Claudia Raiken,
the doula who had

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:90%
asked me to put this together.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
birth professionals.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.540 align:middle line:84%
One was a psychologist who
dealt with conception issues.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:09.320 align:middle line:84%
One was another who dealt
with loss after birth.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And the others
were all doulas who

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:16.160 align:middle line:84%
were deeply involved
in the birth process,

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.670 align:middle line:84%
and being doulas for
20 years, some of them.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And so they came and would
tell me what they needed.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Oh, what do we do if
there's high blood pressure?

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.650 align:middle line:90%
What do we do if there's edema?

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.180 align:middle line:84%
What do we do for
morning sickness?

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.590 align:middle line:84%
So what do we do if
the mother's terrified?

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Is there some way
to calm her fears

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and bring her into
a better space?

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
imagery exercises

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:58.690 align:middle line:84%
that I create are very,
very short, a few seconds

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.220 align:middle line:90%
for the induction.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And the result is
like the subconscious

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:07.790 align:middle line:84%
jumps up and shows
them images that

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.830 align:middle line:90%
clear what they need to clear.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's done
to elicit their own.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Rather than telling them,
this is how it goes,

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.690 align:middle line:84%
this is what your
image should be,

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:20.590 align:middle line:84%
to elicit their own imagery,
their own innate intelligence.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Absolutely.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's the key to what I do.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are some exercises,
especially when we deal

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.190 align:middle line:90%
directly with a physical issue.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Then we may find that this
exercise always works.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.700 align:middle line:84%
For example, how does one
bring down the placenta

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.790 align:middle line:90%
that's not coming down?

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Is there a storyline exercise
that's going to bring it down?

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:51.200 align:middle line:84%
We had this very
interesting event,

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.320 align:middle line:84%
because I had just
written the exercise

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.880 align:middle line:84%
and given it to them,
when a woman called

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:02.650 align:middle line:84%
from Germany, saying,
the midwife is hysteric.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:05.310 align:middle line:84%
More than half an
hour has passed by.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.290 align:middle line:90%
The placenta's not coming down.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:09.540 align:middle line:90%
What should we do?

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And so again, it was
Claudia Raiken this time.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.530 align:middle line:90%
She was on the phone.

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And she said, we've never
tried it, but here it goes.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And she hung up, and
then she was terrified.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And she couldn't reach me, so
she called the other doulas.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.210 align:middle line:90%
What should we do?

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Called back the
woman in Germany.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:32.391 align:middle line:84%
And the woman said, no
worries, the placenta came down

00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:32.890 align:middle line:90%
immediately.

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just fine,
just by that thinking,

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.732 align:middle line:90%
putting it out there.

00:24:35.732 --> 00:24:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: The image.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The image.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Just the image.

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:39.995 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
that's interesting.

00:24:39.995 --> 00:24:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And I had forgotten
about this until just now

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.910 align:middle line:90%
in this conversation.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I used to be
present at the birth of babies,

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.170 align:middle line:90%
but I did something different.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:53.530 align:middle line:84%
I worked with their
feet, almost massaging

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:57.180 align:middle line:84%
with the rhythm of
the contractions,

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.520 align:middle line:84%
because I knew about
things like color therapy

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.210 align:middle line:90%
and how to work with the mind.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:04.470 align:middle line:84%
What I was doing
was imaging color,

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:08.120 align:middle line:84%
where I would have the colors
of blue and soft violets

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.400 align:middle line:84%
around the head to calm the
mind if they were in fear.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I would have
yellow in the belly

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.930 align:middle line:84%
to start creating the
energizing contractions.

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.920 align:middle line:90%
But that happened the hard way.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.380 align:middle line:84%
I had put blue and violet
all through their body, when

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:84%
they started freaking out,
and it's getting intense,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.830 align:middle line:90%
and the contractions stopped.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.160 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, OK,
split the mind.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Split the head from
the body in this way.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, the
mind would be calm,

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and the body would pick their
contractions back up again.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.990 align:middle line:90%
And it was just using color.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:44.817 align:middle line:84%
But obviously I was also seeing
an end result behind the color.

00:25:44.817 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Yes, you must have.

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's probably
what was making the difference.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: No, colors
are very, very powerful

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.245 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:25:51.245 --> 00:25:52.161 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:25:52.161 --> 00:25:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: And
we use color a lot,

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:57.460 align:middle line:84%
but always connected
with images.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.470 align:middle line:84%
For example, if we have
a panicky labor room--

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:05.295 align:middle line:84%
the doctors are going cuckoo,
and the nurses are not calm,

00:26:05.295 --> 00:26:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and so forth-- we fill
the room with blue light.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, blue.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: And it
immediately calms everything.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.490 align:middle line:90%
It really does.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.110 align:middle line:84%
It really helps
the mother a lot.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Yeah.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:15.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:15.485 --> 00:26:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: And then
for exactly the opening,

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:23.970 align:middle line:84%
we have the drop of oil, where
the oil goes down into the body

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:26.910 align:middle line:90%
and starts opening up.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:30.020 align:middle line:90%
And everything flows easily.

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:35.650 align:middle line:84%
The baby can slip out
with the golden oil.

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what are
some of the most common areas

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:44.960 align:middle line:84%
that the people that you have
trained and educated encounter?

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And you can maybe give us an
example of a couple people, how

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.800 align:middle line:90%
they worked through it.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Like you were just
talking about,

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.610 align:middle line:84%
about the blue energy,
a couple more examples

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:57.100 align:middle line:84%
of common problems we encounter
with a woman in labor.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.869 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: In labor
or in pregnancy?

00:26:58.869 --> 00:26:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In labor.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:00.660 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about labor.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.300 align:middle line:90%
And we'll go back.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.758 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back
to the beginning,

00:27:02.758 --> 00:27:05.034 align:middle line:84%
pre-conception, later, kind
of backing into it a bit.

00:27:05.034 --> 00:27:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: OK.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, in labor, for
example, since they're all

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:84%
wearing the monitoring
belt, which constricts them

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and which often
shows little changes

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:27.270 align:middle line:84%
in the baby's heart, which
create panicky situation,

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:32.600 align:middle line:84%
but are not necessarily as
dangerous as the monitoring

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.370 align:middle line:90%
machine is showing us.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So for example, this happened
in one of the births.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:44.820 align:middle line:84%
The doctor goes panicky because
the baby's heart is changing.

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And so the doula
said, close your eyes.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:48.690 align:middle line:90%
Return back.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Go back down and
look at your baby.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.810 align:middle line:90%
Talk to your baby.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:58.592 align:middle line:84%
Immediately the heartbeat
returned to normal,

00:27:58.592 --> 00:27:59.300 align:middle line:90%
ran smooth again.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:27:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:00.729 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Yeah.

00:28:00.729 --> 00:28:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So things like that, we remind
because we train the mother.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:09.490 align:middle line:84%
If we're lucky, we get
her before conception.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:10.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go back to
that part of the journey.

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:17.330 align:middle line:84%
What about another rather common
one, where the baby's just not

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.120 align:middle line:90%
dropping?

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Well,
we had that case.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:26.020 align:middle line:84%
That was a very astonishing
case of a young woman.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.660 align:middle line:90%
They had found some meconium.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:32.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
this dangerous poison

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:38.030 align:middle line:84%
that could really hurt the
baby, and they wanted to induce.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted it immediately,
and she wanted a natural birth.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So it happened to be when
I was giving them the class

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.820 align:middle line:90%
that the call came in.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.310 align:middle line:90%
We all did the exercise.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:57.870 align:middle line:84%
We taught the mother, the young
woman, to do the exercise.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:59.500 align:middle line:90%
Everybody did the exercise.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And that baby dropped
on the instant

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:07.437 align:middle line:84%
and was born naturally, to the
total amazement of the doctors.

00:29:07.437 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: So
this is possible.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I know it sounds
crazy, but it's not.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:16.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, no,
it's not at all crazy.

00:29:16.555 --> 00:29:18.519 align:middle line:84%
These are principles
in the universe.

00:29:18.519 --> 00:29:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Right.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:23.240 align:middle line:84%
If you use the images
correctly, the body

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:27.910 align:middle line:84%
responds, because the
body's language is images.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:84%
The body picks up the world
through form-- information.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And so if we talk to it
in form it understands,

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:40.690 align:middle line:84%
oh, you're asking
me to move this way.

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And so we asked her to open
and open and open and open.

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Baby dropped and was born
normally in the next two hours.

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Perfect.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go back
to pre-conception.

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:56.890 align:middle line:84%
As you said, you like it
when you can get someone

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.250 align:middle line:90%
before conception.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And talk about the
process of pre-conception

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and then getting through that
delicate first trimester.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: OK.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:10.700 align:middle line:10%
Well, why is it so important
to go before conception?

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't need to
be an accidental conception.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.180 align:middle line:90%
It does happen in many cases.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:24.810 align:middle line:90%
But let's say you plant a seed.

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:26.640 align:middle line:84%
If you really think
about your seed,

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and water it carefully, and
really attend to its needs,

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.110 align:middle line:84%
and make sure it has enough
light, and not too much,

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and it's not dry,
and it's not too wet,

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:38.420 align:middle line:90%
you have a better plant.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same here.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:45.410 align:middle line:84%
If your intent is clear
and your desire is clear,

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:51.270 align:middle line:84%
you're giving that soul, that
child who's going to come in,

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:53.850 align:middle line:90%
a much better chance at life.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:31:00.030 align:middle line:84%
You are going from an
unconscious conception

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.180 align:middle line:90%
to a conscious conception.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:07.790 align:middle line:84%
You are bringing
consciousness into the mix.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness is the
most powerful force on earth.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.030 align:middle line:84%
If I want to create
a company, I have

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:22.140 align:middle line:84%
to consciously plant a seed
and start making my plans.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And if I lose interest, that
company's not going to work.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:31.210 align:middle line:84%
But if I keep on really
paying attention and putting

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:36.090 align:middle line:84%
all of my intent into
it, I have a chance.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:38.435 align:middle line:90%
It's the same with a baby.

00:31:38.435 --> 00:31:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
things you mentioned

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:44.560 align:middle line:84%
earlier, which is so
important, is having it

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.650 align:middle line:84%
not just a one-way
street where you're

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:49.190 align:middle line:84%
putting your desires
in for what you wish

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.850 align:middle line:90%
to see develop in that child.

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:55.330 align:middle line:84%
But you find a way to go
into a field of receptivity

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.380 align:middle line:84%
where you can see what
that being is wishing

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:02.624 align:middle line:84%
to experience through you, that
body, this family, that life.

00:32:02.624 --> 00:32:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Oh, absolutely.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so when you're doing
this conscious work,

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:13.550 align:middle line:84%
you can actually-- we call
it calling forth the soul.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:16.950 align:middle line:84%
We actually talk to
this soul that you

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:19.210 align:middle line:84%
have heard calling,
that I heard calling,

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:21.190 align:middle line:90%
that many women hear calling.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:22.980 align:middle line:90%
We talk to that soul.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.700 align:middle line:84%
What do I need to do
to be ready for you?

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
I need to change?

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And very often the
child will say something

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:34.260 align:middle line:90%
like, stop working so much, Mom.

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:36.780 align:middle line:90%


00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Get more relaxed, Mom.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:41.050 align:middle line:90%
Talk to Dad.

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:42.790 align:middle line:90%
He's got a problem.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.730 align:middle line:84%
It's so funny, what
we get to hear.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And what is really
interesting is

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:54.330 align:middle line:84%
that when the woman hears
this, she's able, really,

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:56.100 align:middle line:90%
to work in that direction.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Or she's able to
talk to her husband.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Or something shifts because
she's experienced it.

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:02.510 align:middle line:90%
She's seen it.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now
I have a question.

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.090 align:middle line:90%
We're going back to typography.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:11.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a woman with
firmer, square features,

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:15.450 align:middle line:84%
do they tend to sometimes be
maybe less receptive, but more

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:16.742 align:middle line:90%
wanting to project their ideas?

00:33:16.742 --> 00:33:17.741 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Absolutely.

00:33:17.741 --> 00:33:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are
generalizations.

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:20.330 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: This is true.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Yeah.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:27.730 align:middle line:84%
So there are ways to
speak to people like that,

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:30.960 align:middle line:90%
to help them to get softer.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a process
of-- all creativity

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.860 align:middle line:84%
is a process of
surrendering, really.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very true.

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: So if I
want to lay an egg,

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:45.740 align:middle line:84%
if I'm the hen
laying an egg, I have

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.290 align:middle line:90%
to relax and let it happen.

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.790 align:middle line:84%
If I want to create,
it's not going

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:56.660 align:middle line:84%
to happen by willfully-- no
creativity happens that way.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:04.370 align:middle line:84%
It just pops out of nowhere as
an insight, a surprising event.

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And so receptivity
is an enormous aspect

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:16.096 align:middle line:84%
here of the work that's done
to help women get pregnant.

00:34:16.096 --> 00:34:16.679 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:19.155 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about that
pre-conception state.

00:34:19.155 --> 00:34:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're in
a world that is--

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:24.739 align:middle line:84%
I think stress is the most
ordinary state of being now,

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:28.929 align:middle line:84%
to be stressed out, to be
worried over finances and such.

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:33.050 align:middle line:84%
What has that done globally
to the birth rates and such

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:34.389 align:middle line:90%
in the Western world?

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: They've
gone down, down, down.

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:40.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, while we have an
overpopulation in the world--

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:42.550 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of a contradiction.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.880 align:middle line:84%
In countries like
the United States

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.380 align:middle line:84%
or in France or the
European countries--

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Even Italy.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.593 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: The birth rates
have gone down, down, down.

00:34:51.593 --> 00:34:54.179 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're so
low that we do not

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:56.840 align:middle line:84%
know if we're going to
have enough people to run

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.805 align:middle line:90%
the country.

00:34:57.805 --> 00:34:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they're
below replacement levels.

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Because they're
below replacement levels, yeah.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And do you think
that's directly related

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:06.030 align:middle line:84%
to the amount of
stress we're under?

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:08.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, financial stress
alone, it's like, jeez,

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.160 align:middle line:84%
can I take the time off
to even have a baby?

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.747 align:middle line:84%
If we have a baby, can
we afford to have a baby?

00:35:13.747 --> 00:35:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Well,
it's not only that.

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Do I want to bring a baby
into this crazy, crazy world?

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:20.990 align:middle line:90%
How dangerous it is.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And the men and the
women are deeply

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.530 align:middle line:84%
concerned about the future,
especially the young people

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:30.170 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:31.860 align:middle line:90%
Will I have a job?

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.650 align:middle line:90%
Will I be able to afford this?

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, to
support a family.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:36.524 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: To
support a family.

00:35:36.524 --> 00:35:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Will I be able to help a
child through whatever's

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.890 align:middle line:90%
going to come in the world?

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:44.127 align:middle line:90%
It's so uncertain.

00:35:44.127 --> 00:35:45.460 align:middle line:90%
The world is so uncertain today.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it
seems to be kind

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.740 align:middle line:84%
of an organic cyclical
thing in a certain sense.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:53.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, now the world--
the biggest issue,

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:56.150 align:middle line:84%
according to some--
not all, but some--

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:59.060 align:middle line:84%
is the notion of
future overpopulation

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.310 align:middle line:90%
that the planet can't sustain.

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:02.351 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are a lot
of arguments within that,

00:36:02.351 --> 00:36:05.110 align:middle line:84%
which is, if you're trashing
the planet and doing everything

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:06.660 align:middle line:90%
incorrectly, no, it can't.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.140 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing
things in harmony,

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.390 align:middle line:84%
yeah, maybe it could
sustain even more people.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:middle line:84%
But because of that kind of
general-- what is the word

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking for?

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Like the milieu of the
times and the belief,

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.510 align:middle line:84%
the mass belief that it's
overpopulated, might that not

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.190 align:middle line:84%
be a natural response
to it, is we're

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:26.710 align:middle line:90%
just having less children?

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: I think so.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Psychologically
we're responding.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.151 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: It's not
only psychologically,

00:36:31.151 --> 00:36:32.020 align:middle line:90%
it's biologically.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.692 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Biologically, exactly.

00:36:33.692 --> 00:36:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: So we
have less people

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:40.850 align:middle line:84%
who set up in partnerships
where they could have children,

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:47.020 align:middle line:84%
especially in Europe and
in the United States.

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:53.030 align:middle line:84%
So yes, absolutely any
stress will affect--

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
ability to conceive.

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: But it's
not only those stresses.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.820 align:middle line:84%
But let's say a woman
has had three abortions.

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and now
wants to have a baby.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: And now
wants to have a baby.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of work that
needs-- I mean, a lot of work.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:12.720 align:middle line:84%
We do it in one exercise, and
it is very, very effective.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.600 align:middle line:84%
We help them to clear out
the guilt and the difficulty

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.730 align:middle line:84%
with the souls that have
left, and that they could not

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:22.640 align:middle line:90%
have for one reason or another.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.330 align:middle line:90%
We deal with that.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.750 align:middle line:90%
They may have had miscarriages.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.350 align:middle line:90%
How do we deal with that?

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:31.550 align:middle line:90%
We work on all those levels.

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And then there's another
level that is so important,

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:38.610 align:middle line:90%
is the ancestral storyline.

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:44.860 align:middle line:10%
Grandma, great-grandma,
everybody's had a bad labor.

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to have a bad
labor because it runs down

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:48.470 align:middle line:90%
the family.

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:50.560 align:middle line:90%
Can we change that path?

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, definitely we can.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.754 align:middle line:84%
And we need to from the
very, very beginning.

00:37:55.754 --> 00:37:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot of
times a woman will say,

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:01.130 align:middle line:84%
oh, I lost the baby, and
I had dreamt of that soul,

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:03.910 align:middle line:84%
and they were supposed
to come to me.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:07.944 align:middle line:84%
But a soul can choose
to come later and again.

00:38:07.944 --> 00:38:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Oh, absolutely.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, the same
soul has multiple opportunities

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:13.037 align:middle line:90%
in that sense.

00:38:13.037 --> 00:38:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as though
we have to worry

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.020 align:middle line:84%
that we've deprived
a soul of a vehicle,

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.860 align:middle line:84%
because there is a sort
of order and perfection

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.146 align:middle line:90%
in the larger picture.

00:38:21.146 --> 00:38:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And they'll come if
they need to again,

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:23.460 align:middle line:90%
if you're to be pregnant again.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: We
actually ask them.

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
invite them back.

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:27.746 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: We
actually ask them.

00:38:27.746 --> 00:38:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, very good.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Are you
going to come back?

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And Mom, if you do
this, I'll come back.

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:39.319 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, you define the body
far beyond the physical.

00:38:39.319 --> 00:38:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where
we're getting more

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.440 align:middle line:84%
into the multi-dimensional
aspect of ourselves

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.900 align:middle line:90%
and bringing life in.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.362 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that for a bit?

00:38:46.362 --> 00:38:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Yes.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I talk body, I'm
really talking not only,

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.830 align:middle line:90%
this is my physical boundaries.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:55.310 align:middle line:84%
But if I sit in those
physical boundaries,

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:57.370 align:middle line:90%
they start to expand.

00:38:57.370 --> 00:39:01.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, because of my
senses, I can expand

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.640 align:middle line:90%
to the ends of the world.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.775 align:middle line:90%
I can visualize China.

00:39:05.775 --> 00:39:08.430 align:middle line:90%


00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:11.680 align:middle line:84%
From New York, I'll be in
China at the same time.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.800 align:middle line:84%
I've already expanded
my boundaries.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:19.780 align:middle line:84%
I can see the galaxies,
and so I'm expanding that.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:26.155 align:middle line:84%
My senses will go as far
as I want to expand them.

00:39:26.155 --> 00:39:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And so in that
sense, my boundaries

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:33.780 align:middle line:90%
are not at all what we imagine.

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:37.130 align:middle line:84%
They are in the physical
sense if I get cut.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:39.720 align:middle line:84%
But I can close a
cut much, much faster

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:44.770 align:middle line:84%
if I understand that the
physical body is connected

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:46.085 align:middle line:90%
to a much larger body.

00:39:46.085 --> 00:39:49.510 align:middle line:90%


00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:52.540 align:middle line:84%
It's also connected
to the emotions,

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:55.680 align:middle line:84%
because all emotions
move the body.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.810 align:middle line:84%
So the moment I start
working on the emotions,

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:03.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm also bringing a
larger concept of body

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.800 align:middle line:90%
into the picture.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And for example,
we have an exercise

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.960 align:middle line:90%
called emptying your handbag.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.360 align:middle line:90%
Very powerful.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.700 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing more than
going to the beach

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and emptying the handbag
of everything that

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:23.620 align:middle line:84%
is not absolutely
necessary to my survival.

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.923 align:middle line:90%
We had a call from Australia.

00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And this midwife
called and said,

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.720 align:middle line:84%
I had this
extraordinary experience

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:36.050 align:middle line:84%
with a woman who
could not have sex.

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:37.466 align:middle line:90%
Too tight.

00:40:37.466 --> 00:40:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And so we did all
the manipulations,

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:42.530 align:middle line:90%
and nothing was working.

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And as a last resort, I
taught her this exercise,

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.645 align:middle line:90%
which I thought was ridiculous.

00:40:47.645 --> 00:40:48.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Like you said,
last-ditch effort.

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:50.020 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.311 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Last-ditch effort.

00:40:51.311 --> 00:40:54.542 align:middle line:84%
And immediately this
woman opened up.

00:40:54.542 --> 00:40:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:59.390 align:middle line:84%
So what is it psychologically
in this handbag that's too full?

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Which I think most women
can relate to metaphorically

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:03.220 align:middle line:90%
and literally.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:06.335 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Well, I don't
know what it was personally

00:41:06.335 --> 00:41:06.960 align:middle line:90%
for that woman.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.001 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But in general.

00:41:08.001 --> 00:41:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: But in general,
the moment she had gotten rid

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:17.397 align:middle line:84%
of every emotional block,
if you want, every image--

00:41:17.397 --> 00:41:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Symbolized by
all the junk in her purse.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.854 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: It's
not symbolized.

00:41:20.854 --> 00:41:23.090 align:middle line:90%
It really is there.

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
mean, if you have like,

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:29.600 align:middle line:84%
oh, I don't know, a half-used
pack of gum, old receipts,

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.010 align:middle line:84%
and all this lying around
in the bottom of the bag,

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:34.662 align:middle line:84%
those are symbols for carrying
junk forward, aren't they?

00:41:34.662 --> 00:41:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: I never
called them symbols.

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, what
do you call that?

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: These
are real images.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And they really stick your
body into a bad place.

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:44.953 align:middle line:90%
All right, that's literal.

00:41:44.953 --> 00:41:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: So we
literally throw them out

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:50.870 align:middle line:90%
in the imaginal work.

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:52.390 align:middle line:90%
And then your bag is empty.

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:53.900 align:middle line:90%
We wash the bag.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:55.220 align:middle line:90%
We turn it inside out.

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:56.770 align:middle line:90%
We clear it out.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:02.330 align:middle line:84%
We keep whatever it is the lady
wants to keep-- her key, her--

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't that a
great exercise for anybody?

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Anybody, yeah.

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
I can feel when

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:09.250 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about it what
a lovely experience that would

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:09.490 align:middle line:90%
be.

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:10.198 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Yes.

00:42:10.198 --> 00:42:13.250 align:middle line:84%
They usually walk away
feeling totally relieved.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And it can affect the
emotions, the mental mind.

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:22.900 align:middle line:90%
It can affect their spirit.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:26.210 align:middle line:84%
But it also affects the
physical, as I just told you.

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love this exercise.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.860 align:middle line:84%
I have a group of
women that come over.

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:32.120 align:middle line:90%
I call it the Sedona Tea Party.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's literally we just get
together and share information

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.810 align:middle line:90%
and have tea.

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:38.312 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share that
with them next time.

00:42:38.312 --> 00:42:39.020 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: It's in the book.

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:40.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's beautiful.

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:41.834 align:middle line:90%
I saw it.

00:42:41.834 --> 00:42:43.250 align:middle line:84%
I was just kind
of, at that point,

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:45.670 align:middle line:84%
skimming through
the exercise part.

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:48.090 align:middle line:84%
But as we're talking
about it, I really

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:49.940 align:middle line:90%
feel the potency of that.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: And there are
tapes, so it is on the tapes.

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:54.250 align:middle line:90%
You can hear it.

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:56.169 align:middle line:84%
Often it's much
easier to do exercises

00:42:56.169 --> 00:42:57.960 align:middle line:84%
when you hear them than
when you read them.

00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was listening
to it while I was driving.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:00.820 align:middle line:90%
It was really stupid.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.910 align:middle line:84%
It said right up front,
do not listen to this tape

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:05.350 align:middle line:84%
while you're driving, so of
course I'm listening to it.

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's OK, I
can stay with her.

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:09.004 align:middle line:90%
Now, what about men?

00:43:09.004 --> 00:43:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about
that for a moment.

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:11.690 align:middle line:90%
What if you have a man?

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:13.050 align:middle line:90%
They don't have a purse.

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:13.935 align:middle line:90%
What do they empty?

00:43:13.935 --> 00:43:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Well,
their wallets.

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:16.809 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Their
pockets and wallets.

00:43:16.809 --> 00:43:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Wallets are
very meaningful symbolically

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.520 align:middle line:90%
to a man.

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Empty the wallet of
what you don't need.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.550 align:middle line:84%
But there is a whole
chapter, by the way--

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:29.780 align:middle line:90%
and it was much longer.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I had to cut it for the
publishers-- on exercises

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.140 align:middle line:90%
for the father.

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And the father
often feels left out

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:44.180 align:middle line:84%
because he's no longer
the center of attention.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:48.270 align:middle line:84%
In a couple, he expects
this immediate attention

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:50.300 align:middle line:90%
from his companion.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.690 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't have that anymore.

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.690 align:middle line:84%
She is being asked
to look within,

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:57.510 align:middle line:84%
and I want to talk to you
about that in a moment.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:03.600 align:middle line:84%
But he needs to connect to her
and to connect to the baby.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And there are exercises
that the fathers do.

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:12.017 align:middle line:84%
And every father who's
done it has loved it.

00:44:12.017 --> 00:44:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: So they really
connect to their wife,

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.340 align:middle line:84%
help to support the
baby in imagination,

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:22.591 align:middle line:90%
and talk to the baby.

00:44:22.591 --> 00:44:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about the woman

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:25.760 align:middle line:84%
going within that you
wanted to go back to.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.468 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Yes.

00:44:26.468 --> 00:44:28.650 align:middle line:84%
This is the most
important exercise

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:33.290 align:middle line:84%
in pregnancy, which
is, you close your eyes

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:36.730 align:middle line:90%
and you go down into the womb.

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Many of these women
don't do that.

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:44.370 align:middle line:84%
I had a heartbreaking
email from a woman

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:49.530 align:middle line:84%
from Hong Kong who said to me,
I really want to thank you.

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Three weeks before I gave
birth, I saw your exercise.

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I went down and
looked at the baby.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.230 align:middle line:90%
I had never done that.

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:02.460 align:middle line:84%
I had never felt any
connection to my baby.

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:06.830 align:middle line:90%
And my baby was born, and died.

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:08.730 align:middle line:90%
But now I know how to do it.

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So next time, I'll
be there for him.

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:12.870 align:middle line:90%
It was heartbreaking.

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:14.744 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the women
taking their attention

00:45:14.744 --> 00:45:17.260 align:middle line:84%
inward and away from their
partner is not only natural,

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:17.904 align:middle line:90%
it's necessary.

00:45:17.904 --> 00:45:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: It's necessary.

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:21.470 align:middle line:84%
But if the partner
does it with them,

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:24.840 align:middle line:84%
then they are connected,
deeply connected.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And the father's voice,
the father's presence,

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:33.840 align:middle line:84%
will be just as
powerful to the baby.

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Because the baby, when it's
born, it looks at its mother

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:37.430 align:middle line:90%
immediately.

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Even if there are
10 faces there,

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:42.210 align:middle line:90%
it'll look at its mother.

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And if the father's
done the work,

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:47.172 align:middle line:84%
it'll hear and look at
the father, hear the voice

00:45:47.172 --> 00:45:48.130 align:middle line:90%
and look at the father.

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is probably
the most grown-up moment

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:54.620 align:middle line:84%
in a man's life, where he
has to truly be selfless.

00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Yes.

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And all of these processes
teach the parents

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:02.700 align:middle line:84%
to learn to be parents,
which is selfless,

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.530 align:middle line:90%
a very difficult thing to do.

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:08.440 align:middle line:84%
But what I did want to tell you
about this exercise, the most

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.690 align:middle line:84%
important thing
about the exercise,

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:14.100 align:middle line:90%
is the mother looks at her baby.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And if it's the week in which
the heart is beginning to form,

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:26.470 align:middle line:84%
she visualizes that
heart forming perfectly.

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:29.920 align:middle line:84%
If it's the fingers
growing, she visualizes

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.720 align:middle line:90%
the fingers growing perfectly.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So she is constantly
bringing her attention

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:39.140 align:middle line:84%
and her consciousness, which is
the great power of creativity

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:40.330 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you use it
right, your baby

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:49.216 align:middle line:90%
is going to really develop well.

00:46:49.216 --> 00:46:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.798 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Now,
we have had cases

00:46:51.798 --> 00:46:54.360 align:middle line:84%
in which baby wasn't
developing well

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and in which the visualizations
from one sonogram to the other

00:46:58.110 --> 00:46:59.499 align:middle line:90%
changed the situation.

00:46:59.499 --> 00:47:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes total sense.

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Right.

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:04.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
if our own soul can

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:08.760 align:middle line:84%
have an impact on the little
developing fetus for what

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.104 align:middle line:84%
it wants to experience
through that body,

00:47:11.104 --> 00:47:12.770 align:middle line:84%
why shouldn't the
mother's consciousness

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:14.210 align:middle line:90%
have that as well?

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Well, the
mother's consciousness

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:20.950 align:middle line:84%
is actually, through the
energy of consciousness,

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:25.320 align:middle line:84%
connected to the conscious
unfolding of the baby.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.450 align:middle line:90%
And we can correct--

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:29.087 align:middle line:90%


00:47:29.087 --> 00:47:30.545 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The myriad
of things that

00:47:30.545 --> 00:47:31.794 align:middle line:90%
look like they're going wrong.

00:47:31.794 --> 00:47:34.284 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Yeah,
physical things

00:47:34.284 --> 00:47:35.700 align:middle line:84%
that could go wrong
with the baby.

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.241 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful to
be able to act that consciously

00:47:38.241 --> 00:47:39.752 align:middle line:90%
with the developing fetus.

00:47:39.752 --> 00:47:40.460 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: We had a
case-- this was twins.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor
said to the mother,

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:50.420 align:middle line:90%
this twin is going to die.

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.890 align:middle line:84%
So we went back
in and we looked.

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And what was wrong was that
the umbilical cord wasn't

00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:59.560 align:middle line:90%
large enough for this baby.

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.100 align:middle line:90%
We enlarged it.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And two weeks later, this
baby was doing as well

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:07.900 align:middle line:90%
as the other one.

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:12.226 align:middle line:84%
And both twins were born
normally and are thriving.

00:48:12.226 --> 00:48:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is something we need

00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:15.890 align:middle line:90%
to make the point of right now.

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:18.380 align:middle line:84%
This is not an
extraordinary skill set.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:20.339 align:middle line:84%
This is the power every
single human being has.

00:48:20.339 --> 00:48:21.338 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Absolutely.

00:48:21.338 --> 00:48:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All they have to
do is, with clarity and love,

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:24.976 align:middle line:90%
focus their intention.

00:48:24.976 --> 00:48:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Exactly.

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's all.

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Yeah.

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I
give exercises here.

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:36.830 align:middle line:84%
But I tell every mother, if you
have your own images, that's

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:38.045 align:middle line:90%
even better.

00:48:38.045 --> 00:48:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to get to another
nuance of that in a moment.

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:43.920 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about the situation

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.990 align:middle line:84%
where the baby continues to
develop, what they would say,

00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:49.590 align:middle line:90%
abnormally.

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:51.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a point
of consciousness,

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I think, too that might
be difficult for a mother

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:56.310 align:middle line:84%
or parent to
understand, that that's

00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:59.450 align:middle line:84%
that child's creation
and path for what

00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:00.881 align:middle line:90%
they need in this incarnation.

00:49:00.881 --> 00:49:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Absolutely.

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not to
take responsibility

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:06.016 align:middle line:84%
if it continues developing
in a certain way.

00:49:06.016 --> 00:49:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Well, there
again that connection

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:12.250 align:middle line:84%
of the baby and the mother
is very, very, very helpful.

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They can see why,
the why back to the mother.

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Yes, and they talk,
or they show in images, Mom,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.280 align:middle line:84%
this is the reason I came here
for five weeks or 10 weeks,

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.930 align:middle line:90%
and because.

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:28.110 align:middle line:90%
And they'll show the reason.

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And then the mother
is much more able,

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:35.370 align:middle line:84%
because she has experienced
it, to let that baby go.

00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:39.990 align:middle line:84%
OK, now what about the world's
different religious practices

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:41.080 align:middle line:90%
and visualizations?

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Do you find that, say, you
have a different experience

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.640 align:middle line:84%
from one woman to
another, depending

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.344 align:middle line:90%
on their religious background?

00:49:48.344 --> 00:49:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: No.

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they're
creating their own thing.

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.840 align:middle line:84%
You're not putting
images in their heads.

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Not at all.

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.240 align:middle line:90%
But I'm very careful.

00:49:55.240 --> 00:50:00.870 align:middle line:84%
For example, I won't
use Mary with a Muslim.

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:02.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes, right, exactly.

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: I'm very careful to
always know their background so

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:09.680 align:middle line:84%
that the language that
we use is a language that

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:14.070 align:middle line:90%
corresponds to their culture.

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:18.750 align:middle line:84%
It's very important because if
not, it's going to make them--

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:23.170 align:middle line:84%
I remember a case of a woman
who had terrible imagery.

00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that if I didn't
get her out of this--

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:29.890 align:middle line:84%
she had post-traumatic stress,
and there was blood everywhere.

00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:30.910 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere.

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:33.260 align:middle line:90%
I knew she was Jewish.

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.950 align:middle line:90%
It was pouring blood everywhere.

00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, well,
you're not the only Jew

00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:41.950 align:middle line:90%
who crossed the Red Sea.

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And she went right through
into the Holy Land.

00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And I had thought if I
didn't get her through that,

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:51.710 align:middle line:90%
she would die in the office.

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:55.460 align:middle line:90%
The cultural belief--

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: The cultural
belief was so strong.

00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:02.929 align:middle line:84%
She crossed the Red Sea, but
she crossed into the Holy Land.

00:51:02.929 --> 00:51:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
have to be on your feet

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:05.810 align:middle line:90%
when this is happening.

00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about something
that we talked a little bit

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:10.010 align:middle line:90%
about off-camera.

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:13.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most women today,
or a lot of women today,

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:15.620 align:middle line:84%
ideally would like
to have a home birth.

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And in certain countries--
I think in your book

00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:20.820 align:middle line:84%
it said something like
2/3 of births in Holland

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:21.850 align:middle line:90%
are home births.

00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Well, yeah,
they have a fantastic system.

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.856 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
means they must

00:51:25.856 --> 00:51:27.887 align:middle line:84%
have highly-trained
midwives, and a lot of them

00:51:27.887 --> 00:51:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: They have a system.

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're a tiny
country, a small country,

00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:37.150 align:middle line:84%
in which it's easy to move
the mother to a hospital

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:38.270 align:middle line:90%
if need be.

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And what they have is they
have a good communication

00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:44.140 align:middle line:90%
between doctor and midwife.

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:47.620 align:middle line:84%
It is understood that
most women give birth

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:50.370 align:middle line:90%
at home with a midwife.

00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:52.230 align:middle line:90%
But they have a doctor.

00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So if need be, they're
transferred to the hospital

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:56.980 align:middle line:90%
immediately.

00:51:56.980 --> 00:52:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But in the States, I think the
best solution is a birthing

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:05.097 align:middle line:90%
center in a hospital.

00:52:05.097 --> 00:52:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And why is that?

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of women
hearing this would say, what?

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:09.870 align:middle line:90%
I want to have a home birth.

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:11.520 align:middle line:90%
What about the water birth?

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:12.471 align:middle line:90%
I want a water birth?

00:52:12.471 --> 00:52:13.220 align:middle line:90%
Which makes sense.

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Well, they can
have it in a birthing center.

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about what

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:18.060 align:middle line:84%
you mean by birthing
centers, what they're like.

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Well, if they're
really good birthing centers,

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.510 align:middle line:90%
they have the midwives.

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:24.770 align:middle line:90%
They have the pools.

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:26.560 align:middle line:90%
They have the soft lights.

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:30.096 align:middle line:84%
They have everything you want
for what you would expect,

00:52:30.096 --> 00:52:31.220 align:middle line:90%
like, say, in a home birth.

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:34.040 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes it's
difficult to put a pool in.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.799 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, true.

00:52:35.799 --> 00:52:37.090 align:middle line:90%
A bathtub will have to suffice.

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: And then they
have, next door, the hospital.

00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:43.759 align:middle line:90%
So it covers both sides.

00:52:43.759 --> 00:52:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But why do you
say in the United States

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.970 align:middle line:84%
you think that's
more preferable?

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Because the
culture in the United States

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:51.840 align:middle line:90%
is medical.

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:55.626 align:middle line:84%
People, women, go
to the doctors.

00:52:55.626 --> 00:52:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And if the doctor says
you've got to do that,

00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:58.940 align:middle line:90%
that's what they do.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:00.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's become so medicalized--

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's our cultural
belief that has created that.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:02.949 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Yeah.

00:53:02.949 --> 00:53:07.330 align:middle line:84%
It's so medicalized, much,
much more than it should be.

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:10.780 align:middle line:84%
It's now, you're an ill
person coming to the hospital

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:11.420 align:middle line:90%
to have a baby.

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:16.270 align:middle line:90%


00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:21.085 align:middle line:84%
Midwives who actually
support home births

00:53:21.085 --> 00:53:23.290 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of difficulty.

00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:24.530 align:middle line:90%
They are ostracized.

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:25.950 align:middle line:90%
They don't find a doctor.

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:30.520 align:middle line:84%
They can't find the avenue into
a hospital if they need it.

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:34.850 align:middle line:84%
A friend recently
had a baby, and I

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:36.880 align:middle line:84%
wondered about a couple
things that went on.

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.380 align:middle line:84%
There was a situation
that probably

00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:41.595 align:middle line:84%
should have required going
to the hospital, actually.

00:53:41.595 --> 00:53:45.570 align:middle line:90%


00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:50.460 align:middle line:84%
The midwives here often will
get into such a strong stance,

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:54.150 align:middle line:84%
which is, we'll do everything
to avoid the hospital,

00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:56.630 align:middle line:84%
to the point where it goes
a little too far sometimes.

00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:58.900 align:middle line:90%
And a woman can go into danger.

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:01.330 align:middle line:90%
Her baby can go into danger.

00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: If the midwife
hasn't got a good relationship

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:08.024 align:middle line:84%
to a doctor and a hospital,
it's not a good situation.

00:54:08.024 --> 00:54:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
what we need to look

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:10.820 align:middle line:90%
for if we want a midwife.

00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Absolutely.

00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One who
is very flexible,

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:14.910 align:middle line:90%
depending on the situation.

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:16.620 align:middle line:90%
And the doctor can--

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: And she's
got a good relationship

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:20.347 align:middle line:90%
to a doctor and a hospital.

00:54:20.347 --> 00:54:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent.

00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:22.110 align:middle line:90%
That's very good advice.

00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:23.734 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: And, of
course, she should

00:54:23.734 --> 00:54:25.350 align:middle line:90%
have learned Dream Birth.

00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:26.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:26.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because sometimes
your best-laid plans--

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:32.480 align:middle line:84%
and the woman I'm speaking
of is the picture of health.

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:33.384 align:middle line:90%
It was so funny.

00:54:33.384 --> 00:54:35.300 align:middle line:84%
The day the baby was
due-- it was a week late.

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:37.460 align:middle line:90%
It came a week late.

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:41.690 align:middle line:84%
She was sitting
cross-legged on the floor,

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:43.550 align:middle line:84%
hopped up, and leaped
across the room.

00:54:43.550 --> 00:54:44.850 align:middle line:90%
She'd been on a hike that day.

00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:47.610 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, as though she had
no extra weight on her body

00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:50.330 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever, just leaping along.

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:52.759 align:middle line:84%
And so you would
expect maybe that might

00:54:52.759 --> 00:54:54.550 align:middle line:84%
be a little easier
birth, but it turned out

00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:56.850 align:middle line:84%
to be a very
difficult situation.

00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And getting the mind
out of that place,

00:54:58.550 --> 00:55:00.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm having this perfect
birth-- and she's

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:03.080 align:middle line:90%
quite a conscious woman.

00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.100 align:middle line:90%
Best-laid plans, as they say.

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: It's actually
women who want a natural birth,

00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:12.370 align:middle line:90%
and for some reason cannot.

00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:14.040 align:middle line:90%
They get very sad.

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.250 align:middle line:84%
They have a hard
time afterwards.

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And we have to remind them
always, the body knows best.

00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:22.780 align:middle line:90%
And your baby knows best.

00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:27.420 align:middle line:84%
You have to-- the
only important thing

00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:28.760 align:middle line:90%
is your baby's born healthy.

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the
only important thing,

00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:31.530 align:middle line:90%
you're both safe.

00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And you have exercises
in there for that,

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:38.390 align:middle line:84%
also for general postpartum
blues for mothers as well,

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:40.440 align:middle line:84%
and how to start dealing
with the separation

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.040 align:middle line:90%
and this new responsibility.

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have done your
work here in this book.

00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:49.032 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of very
beautiful and useful exercises.

00:55:49.032 --> 00:55:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: I hope so.

00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.890 align:middle line:90%
We have many more.

00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's a good start.

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Yeah, we
have many more in there.

00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:57.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's for the trained
birth professionals

00:55:57.670 --> 00:56:01.160 align:middle line:84%
to use them, because
these are ones

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:03.810 align:middle line:90%
that can be done by anybody.

00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:06.726 align:middle line:84%
And so those are the ones
that I put in the exercises.

00:56:06.726 --> 00:56:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's look
at the opposite lens.

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.224 align:middle line:84%
Here we have women--
we've been talking

00:56:10.224 --> 00:56:13.340 align:middle line:84%
about women who want to
communicate, do this naturally.

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you have,
some would say,

00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:17.540 align:middle line:84%
a very unconscious
medical industry

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:21.520 align:middle line:84%
where the doctor suggests a
cesarean because he doesn't

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:22.780 align:middle line:90%
want to work that weekend.

00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Right.

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Comments?

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: It's very common.

00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:30.157 align:middle line:90%
30% of births are cesareans.

00:56:30.157 --> 00:56:31.240 align:middle line:90%
It's not the exact number.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the latest number is.

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:33.985 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
should realistically

00:56:33.985 --> 00:56:37.530 align:middle line:84%
be the number for people who
have genuine medical emergency?

00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: 12% maybe, 15% max.

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
rest is elective.

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Yeah.

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:46.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are women
who say, I want a cesarean.

00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:47.480 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:47.880 align:middle line:90%
I want--

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't want the pain.

00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: We do not fight.

00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:59.050 align:middle line:84%
We always explore with the
woman what she really wants.

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:00.530 align:middle line:90%
I had a student like that.

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Her mother had had a horrible
birth and nearly died.

00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted a
cesarean, so she

00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:10.380 align:middle line:84%
had her first baby with
a cesarean, second baby

00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:12.350 align:middle line:90%
with a cesarean.

00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:15.390 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, because
of the first cesarean,

00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:17.900 align:middle line:90%
she nearly bled to death.

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:23.320 align:middle line:84%
So it was like a self-fulfilling
prophecy, because the mother

00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:25.300 align:middle line:90%
had nearly bled to death.

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:28.620 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't want to
change that mindset.

00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:31.150 align:middle line:90%
And we cannot force people.

00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:34.980 align:middle line:84%
All we can do is
stimulate the inside.

00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And the inside, if it has the
power to transform itself,

00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:41.570 align:middle line:90%
will do that.

00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:46.520 align:middle line:84%
In that case, no, the
inside was very clearly,

00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:49.040 align:middle line:90%
no, I'm not going to do that.

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:54.980 align:middle line:84%
So if we'd had more
time, if-- who knows?

00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:56.670 align:middle line:90%
But this did not happen.

00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:59.705 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Pregnancy and birth
requires extreme flexibility.

00:57:59.705 --> 00:58:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Extreme.

00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And we always tell them,
whatever your inside shows you

00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:06.580 align:middle line:90%
that you need to do, we support.

00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:07.812 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Follow that first.

00:58:07.812 --> 00:58:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: We follow
that first and foremost.

00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:14.300 align:middle line:84%
We'll never go against
what the-- we had a case,

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:17.380 align:middle line:84%
and that was an interesting
case of a woman who

00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:21.660 align:middle line:84%
had been raped in a war
situation, an absolutely

00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:23.310 align:middle line:90%
terrible situation.

00:58:23.310 --> 00:58:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And I had worked on her
post-traumatic stress

00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:28.160 align:middle line:90%
a long time.

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she was
pregnant as a result of--

00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: No.

00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:33.490 align:middle line:90%
She was pregnant much later.

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:36.690 align:middle line:84%
But she wanted to keep the baby
because it had been a genocide.

00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:38.280 align:middle line:90%
All her family had gone.

00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So I understood she
wanted to keep the baby,

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:44.790 align:middle line:84%
although the situation
was dramatic.

00:58:44.790 --> 00:58:47.040 align:middle line:90%
But she kept the baby.

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:51.890 align:middle line:84%
She had all the support we gave
her from the beginning-- all

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:53.310 align:middle line:90%
the imagery, all the work.

00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:54.830 align:middle line:90%
She'd done the imagery.

00:58:54.830 --> 00:59:00.130 align:middle line:84%
When it came time for the baby
to be born-- baby in place,

00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:03.740 align:middle line:90%
fully dilated-- nope.

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:04.530 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:59:04.530 --> 00:59:06.029 align:middle line:90%
That baby would not come out.

00:59:06.029 --> 00:59:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was not coming.

00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Why?

00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:10.097 align:middle line:90%
It's dirty down there.

00:59:10.097 --> 00:59:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Yeah.

00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And that baby was
born by cesarean,

00:59:14.850 --> 00:59:16.789 align:middle line:84%
although we had worked
on cleaning that.

00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
things had happened

00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:19.460 align:middle line:90%
that were not desirable.

00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Yeah.

00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:23.114 align:middle line:84%
And so she would not
let that baby be born.

00:59:23.114 --> 00:59:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:59:24.030 --> 00:59:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: So the power
of emotion is great.

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And we supported her
then in her choice

00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.610 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
the body wanted to do.

00:59:33.610 --> 00:59:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Yeah.

00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:37.048 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you would
have caused more trauma

00:59:37.048 --> 00:59:38.075 align:middle line:90%
to try to go against it.

00:59:38.075 --> 00:59:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: Never
go against it.

00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:39.728 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Any final thoughts?

00:59:39.728 --> 00:59:43.510 align:middle line:84%
We have only a
couple minutes left.

00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAINBERG: What I would like,
of course, is for all babies

00:59:46.410 --> 00:59:52.930 align:middle line:84%
to be born consciously, for all
women to conceive consciously

00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and to put loving attention
into their pregnancies,

00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.850 align:middle line:84%
and that this would fill
their homes with love.

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:03.900 align:middle line:10%
And God knows, today
it seems we need

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:07.620 align:middle line:10%
more and more of that
female consciousness

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:15.020 align:middle line:10%
to grow, and not to be caught
so much by the stresses of maybe

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:22.240 align:middle line:10%
a male society that pushes
us to a lot of busyness,

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.630 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of competition,
and career, and money,

01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:31.500 align:middle line:10%
and come back to the intuition
and the true knowledge which is

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.720 align:middle line:10%
inside of us and in our bodies.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:38.380 align:middle line:10%
And if the women could
switch back into that,

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:44.020 align:middle line:10%
the power of the subconscious,
the power of the intuition,

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.280 align:middle line:10%
is like a shortcut.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.190 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take you
exactly where you need

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:50.266 align:middle line:90%
to go so fast and so easily.

01:00:50.266 --> 01:00:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautifully said.

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is too, if
the men come in it with you

01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:58.060 align:middle line:84%
and participate in this
process with the woman,

01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:01.980 align:middle line:84%
then we start seeing larger
changes in society as well

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:03.490 align:middle line:90%
about nurturing new life.

01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Absolutely.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
so much for your time.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:06.680 align:middle line:90%
You've done a beaut--

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Thank you.

01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would
recommend that for anyone

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.390 align:middle line:84%
who's considering
having a child,

01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:12.120 align:middle line:90%
or who is already pregnant.

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful work.

01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:13.450 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAINBERG: Thank you, Regina.

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, the name
of the book is "DreamBirth."

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Along that line,
you may also want

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.020 align:middle line:84%
to watch my interview
in the CMN archives

01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:24.600 align:middle line:84%
with Elena Tonetti-Vladimirova,
who was raised in the Soviet

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.440 align:middle line:90%
Russia.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:28.580 align:middle line:10%
She speaks of what happens
when bonding is not allowed.

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:31.260 align:middle line:10%
It's a shocking story, and
almost the opposite of this,

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:34.770 align:middle line:10%
showing the need for this
kind of work together.

01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
