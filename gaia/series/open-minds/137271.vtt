[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:29.960 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Andrea
Perron is back with us.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.630 align:middle line:10%
Her family story, featured
in the film, "The Conjuring,"

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.490 align:middle line:10%
is now the second-highest
grossing film

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:10%
in the genre next
to "The Exorcist."

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.560 align:middle line:84%
In her new work of fiction,
along with co-writer George

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Lopez, they write about
entangling one's self

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.030 align:middle line:84%
in a timeline that
doesn't belong to them

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.120 align:middle line:90%
with disastrous consequences.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.680 align:middle line:84%
This new book, "In a
Flicker," is challenging.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And this conversation
will reflect some of that

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.660 align:middle line:84%
as we go through some really
intense concepts, here,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.890 align:middle line:90%
philosophically.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.980 align:middle line:84%
But before we get to all
of that, first of all, wow.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Your family story
really took off.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to
that, let's just

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.740 align:middle line:84%
talk a little bit
about, first, what

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.040 align:middle line:90%
happened with you after that?

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.514 align:middle line:84%
Because, as we talked about
last time, a lot of the--

00:01:11.514 --> 00:01:13.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean a number of the
events were chronicled,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:90%
of your family's experience.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.490 align:middle line:90%
Some were softened.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.140 align:middle line:90%
Some were eliminated.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And so, it was
kind of a combined

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.540 align:middle line:84%
story of the Warren's experience
and your family story.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.937 align:middle line:84%
So in response to that, you've
been looking into something.

00:01:26.937 --> 00:01:28.270 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that for a sec.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.470 align:middle line:10%
>>ANDREA PERRON: Well,
you know, "The Conjuring,"

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:10%
is a wonderful film
for what it is.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.200 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.866 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRON: But it was
impossible for them

00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:38.060 align:middle line:10%
to compress 10
years into 2 hours.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.250 align:middle line:10%
There isn't a single
scene in the film

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.190 align:middle line:10%
that comes directly
from my books,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:10%
"House of Darkness,
House of Light."

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's all right,
because the films--

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and there's a
"Conjuring 2," now, also

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.672 align:middle line:90%
based on one other case file--

00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not your
family's though?

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Not my family.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.520 align:middle line:84%
We were the first
one, "The Conjuring."

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And then they did the Enfield
poltergeist from England.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And there are further films
slated to come through.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.480 align:middle line:10%
However, there was
a part of me that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.390 align:middle line:10%
was really disappointed that
it wasn't an authentic telling

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:10%
of our story.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And so, consequently, I
decided to take it upon myself

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.350 align:middle line:84%
to begin writing the
screenplays of my three books.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And I have already got
a fabulous director,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.090 align:middle line:90%
a wonderful producer.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.040 align:middle line:90%
It's already out in Hollywood.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:90%
The buzz has already begun.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to
make a trilogy of films

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.030 align:middle line:84%
that do tell the genuine story
of what happened to our family

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.100 align:middle line:90%
over the course of a decade.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.390 align:middle line:90%
It's coming.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And for anybody that
hasn't seen our conversations,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:84%
we did three conversations,
one on each of these books.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And it is so , complex
so rich in itself.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.690 align:middle line:84%
There was no need to have to
run it through another lens,

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.800 align:middle line:84%
to exaggerate or
take away from it.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.740 align:middle line:84%
They were already
amazing stories.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Because when you put
your part into the story,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.140 align:middle line:84%
it becomes
multi-dimensional, and it

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.700 align:middle line:84%
has higher purpose and
meaning than just the genre.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Every kid, I say, oh, yeah,
I'm interviewing Andrea Perron.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Her family, their story
was "The Conjuring."

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love that film.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean kids are crazy about it.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.190 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
about the notion of fright.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.460 align:middle line:90%
And we'll talk about that.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.452 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:03:24.452 --> 00:03:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anyway,
where I was going

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.951 align:middle line:84%
with that is I think that
your own stories really

00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:84%
warrant you going back and
doing a complete redo on it.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, I think
it's what's fair for people.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Those who would
only see the movie

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.250 align:middle line:84%
and would never even think
of reading the back story,

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.390 align:middle line:84%
deserve to have the opportunity
to see it come to life on film

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and to have it be
authentically told.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:84%
It's just too compelling
a story for it

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:84%
to be lost in obscurity as the
back story behind the feature

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:90%
film.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:84%
When, in effect, it
wasn't a horror story.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:90%
It was essentially a love story.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
people don't grasp.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And I am one of
the few people that

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:84%
works in the paranormal that
focuses all my attention not

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:84%
on the darkness
but on the light.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I've seen the
dark side of existence.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And I choose deliberately
to live in the light.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.470 align:middle line:84%
I find our story incredibly
hopeful and inspiring.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And I want to give
that to the world,

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.290 align:middle line:84%
too, because we live
in a dualistic world.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.450 align:middle line:84%
We live where there
is darkness and light,

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.310 align:middle line:90%
where there is good and evil.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I am a spiritual
warrior for peace.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I am someone-- and that's not
a counterintuitive notion,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.860 align:middle line:90%
by any stretch.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And so the only right
thing for me to do

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.650 align:middle line:90%
is to put our story out there--

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.880 align:middle line:90%
that's true.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:84%
You know "The Conjuring"
is based on a true story.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.090 align:middle line:84%
It was based on the case files
of Ed and Lorraine Warren.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but it
missed a lot of the nuances.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It got
about 5% of it right.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know, I tell
people about these stories.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I've always
been intrigued

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
with the notion
of time and space,

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.220 align:middle line:84%
what is commonly called
parallel timelines.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.380 align:middle line:84%
We don't really, I don't
think, fully understand

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.340 align:middle line:84%
what's going on with time and
that it can turn back on itself

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and almost compress two or three
times into one space and time.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just
endlessly fascinated

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.230 align:middle line:90%
with what this means.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And one of the stories
that was told in your book

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.240 align:middle line:84%
that just I could never
shake from my head.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.100 align:middle line:84%
There were many, but another
one, in particular, too.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.450 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was your mother
was in the dining room looking

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:84%
at a family, who was
dining in that dining

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.400 align:middle line:84%
room, a couple hundred
years before, however

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.460 align:middle line:84%
many years before, and the
woman turned and looked

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.750 align:middle line:90%
at your mother.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And you think, whose
timeline was that?

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Who's the ghost?

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: That's exactly right.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.830 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it was a man.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A man, OK.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And he nudged
the man beside him.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.540 align:middle line:90%
And they made eye contact.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking into
the future to see her.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And she was looking into
the past to see them.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.109 align:middle line:84%
And that was the most important
story out of all them.

00:06:10.109 --> 00:06:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I still get chills,
right now, thinking about this.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, because
it was her epiphany.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.980 align:middle line:84%
My mother is a very intelligent,
very pragmatic person.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And what was happening
in that house

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.130 align:middle line:90%
was just blowing her mind.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first time that
it actually made sense to her.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And she realized
that we were existing

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.530 align:middle line:84%
in multiple dimensions,
simultaneously,

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.210 align:middle line:84%
with the people that
lived in that house

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.530 align:middle line:90%
and loved that house.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And they were simply
revisiting to have a meal.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So that's one thing.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get a little
bit into the whole parallel

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.525 align:middle line:84%
and time frame subject in
the new book, "In a Flicker."

00:06:44.525 --> 00:06:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the other thing
that, really, I just found

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.350 align:middle line:84%
fascinating, too, is how
beings work between dimensions

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.050 align:middle line:90%
and the use of electricity.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know, was that
book number two or three?

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.760 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember now.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.385 align:middle line:84%
It's been a while
since I've read them.

00:07:03.385 --> 00:07:05.630 align:middle line:84%
But whichever book it was
that talked about how--

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: The first volume.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When the beings
were coming through,

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:15.200 align:middle line:84%
your electric meter
would start spinning.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And they were draining
massive amounts of electricity

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.076 align:middle line:84%
from the house electrical
system to manifest,

00:07:21.076 --> 00:07:21.950 align:middle line:90%
which is interesting.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like they had their
fingers stuck into the socket.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.990 align:middle line:84%
They were just using the energy
present to be able to manifest

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.625 align:middle line:84%
into this dimension, to be able
to have physical interaction.

00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And they weren't
just stealing the electricity.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.770 align:middle line:84%
There were months that our
electric bill was higher

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.090 align:middle line:90%
than the mortgage.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And then there would be
a massive manifestation.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And then it would drop to
$10, the next month just drop.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one of
the meter readers

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:56.000 align:middle line:84%
that came out, when he saw the
meter spinning, he freaked.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.420 align:middle line:84%
He ran off the property,
jumped in his truck, and left.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.320 align:middle line:90%
He said this isn't possible.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, and if he'd heard
tales about your family,

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.736 align:middle line:84%
he knew to jump in and go
away, don't ask any questions.

00:08:07.736 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: But they
drained us, as well.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.757 align:middle line:84%
Think about five prepubescent
children, little girls

00:08:13.757 --> 00:08:14.840 align:middle line:90%
running around that house.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.670 align:middle line:90%
We were a bunch of tomboys.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:20.540 align:middle line:84%
The energy levels from all
of us were through the roof.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And there were incidents, like
when my sister walked right

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.950 align:middle line:84%
through the operation, and
then was completely drained.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.440 align:middle line:84%
I've had incidents
like that myself.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.240 align:middle line:84%
I had an incident, a
couple of years ago,

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.880 align:middle line:84%
where I went to St. Augustine,
which is one of the most

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.990 align:middle line:90%
haunted cities in the world.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.299 align:middle line:90%
And I was unprepared.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:39.860 align:middle line:90%
And I was unprotected.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was just going to
do a book signing and a lecture.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And I stepped away from
the table for a few moments

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.580 align:middle line:90%
and went into an alcove.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was standing there
admiring a beautiful banana

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.640 align:middle line:84%
tree at Ripley's Believe
It or Not Museum.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And I heard a little
girl behind me.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And she said, mom,
look at that lady.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Look at all the lights
around that lady.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And I turned around to see what
lady she was talking about,

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.790 align:middle line:90%
and it was me.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And her mother's eyes were
as big as dinner platters.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And she grabbed her child
and dragged her away from me.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And 15 minutes later, I
had to be loaded into a car

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:90%
and taken home.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I had to miss all the rest
of my obligations that day.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:90%
I apologized to the manager.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And my father basically
said, she's not feeling well.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had no energy
left in my body.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:90%
And he took me home.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And I slept for
18 hours straight,

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.570 align:middle line:90%
before I could recover.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is fascinating.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we could see,
in living color-- you can.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Most people can't watch, in
living color, in the other,

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.300 align:middle line:84%
less dense forms of our reality,
how these processes take place.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Again, I find it fascinating,
because electricity

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.610 align:middle line:90%
works between dimensions.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is something that
physicists have not really

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.540 align:middle line:90%
grokked yet.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.674 align:middle line:84%
But you, so simply telling
your tale, are proof of that.

00:10:02.674 --> 00:10:03.840 align:middle line:90%
I have had that happen, too.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.839 align:middle line:84%
And forgive me, if I
mentioned this once before,

00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:08.810 align:middle line:84%
but on 35th birthday, I
laid down to take a nap

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.534 align:middle line:84%
and felt someone, invisible,
playing with my hand.

00:10:12.534 --> 00:10:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think much
of it, because I'm not

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:90%
afraid of that stuff.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden, all
the energy starts draining out.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:20.060 align:middle line:90%
It's going out my feet.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, this is odd.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I collapsed
when I tried to stand up.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:26.767 align:middle line:90%
My muscles wouldn't work.

00:10:26.767 --> 00:10:28.100 align:middle line:90%
And I'd been completely drained.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.770 align:middle line:84%
I talked to my beings
about it later.

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.900 align:middle line:84%
They said, well,
you didn't say, no.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Exactly.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.825 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is a very
interesting thought, too.

00:10:35.825 --> 00:10:39.100 align:middle line:84%
There's no judgement in other
realms about these things.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.160 align:middle line:84%
If you don't wish for this
to happen, state clearly,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.140 align:middle line:90%
you may not have my energy.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.794 align:middle line:84%
And you can thwart
these kinds of things

00:10:46.794 --> 00:10:47.710 align:middle line:90%
if they were to occur.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.480 align:middle line:84%
But we just don't
understand the rules

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.430 align:middle line:84%
of these interdimensional
games at all.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: We don't.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:52.500 align:middle line:90%
We don't.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And the dynamics, it's a
whole different process.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:04.360 align:middle line:84%
We can only see a fraction
of what there is that exists.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And as we go through
this paradigm shift that

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.940 align:middle line:84%
is occurring now, worldwide,
a global wave of consciousness

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:84%
raising, which is
occurring, which

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.750 align:middle line:84%
you and I both get to be a
part of, which is so exciting.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: But part
of that process

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.370 align:middle line:84%
is that people begin to
understand that they aren't

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.890 align:middle line:90%
experiencing a new reality.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.370 align:middle line:84%
They're experiencing a new
awareness of the old reality.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:33.685 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:33.685 --> 00:11:36.130 align:middle line:84%
I just had to bring those
up, because they just haven't

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.910 align:middle line:90%
left my mind since we last met.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's get on to "In a Flicker."

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Now you had a little
bit of postpartum blues,

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.140 align:middle line:84%
which you were going
through when I saw you last.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:84%
You had just finished
up the final volume.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.320 align:middle line:84%
You'd invested so much
of your energy and life

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.880 align:middle line:90%
into those three books.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:90%
And now what?

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how
"In a Flicker," came about.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well,
interestingly, there

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.580 align:middle line:84%
were nothing but problems
with the third book.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:84%
I thought it would
be the easiest.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most
difficult. And I had already

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:09.640 align:middle line:84%
handed all my materials in to
my publisher in April or May

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.350 align:middle line:90%
of 2014.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted the book out,
so that I could introduce it

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.980 align:middle line:84%
at the Ocean State ParaCon in
my own hometown of Harrisville,

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:18.970 align:middle line:90%
Rhode Island.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.290 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't ready.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:27.370 align:middle line:84%
It didn't come out until August
7th, 2014, 7 years to the day

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.320 align:middle line:90%
that I began the project.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.290 align:middle line:84%
It was like the
universe was stalling

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:90%
for time to make that happen.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.420 align:middle line:90%
And I was so elated.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was on
the phone with George

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.370 align:middle line:84%
when the email came through that
the book had just gone live.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:43.895 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is George
Lopez, who is your co-author.

00:12:43.895 --> 00:12:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Yes, he
was my co-author.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:45.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And I said, wait
a minute, George.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.110 align:middle line:84%
I said, this date is
sticking in my head.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.760 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a hoarder of calendars.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I write everything on
my paper calendars.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I went into my trunk,
while I had him on the phone.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yep, there
it is, August 7th,

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.810 align:middle line:90%
2007 is when I began writing.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And in the box, on the calendar,
it said, "and so it begins."

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So now here's George, again,
all these years later.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And how did "In a Flicker"
and this concept come up?

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.400 align:middle line:90%
This is a challenging story.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: He was
concerned for me.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And he was
legitimately concerned.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.790 align:middle line:90%
We had done a ParaCon together.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:90%
And we had a long drive home.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.825 align:middle line:84%
And on the way home,
I confessed to him.

00:13:28.825 --> 00:13:30.990 align:middle line:90%
Phew.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I can
tell your eyes are

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.690 align:middle line:90%
getting a little welled up.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I told him I
was seeing myself dead.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.730 align:middle line:84%
I kept having visions
of my own demise.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.230 align:middle line:90%
And I said, this can't be.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:45.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm a young woman.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.620 align:middle line:84%
I have so much
more to contribute.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.480 align:middle line:90%
Why is this happening?

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.319 align:middle line:90%
And I thought maybe I was born--

00:13:52.319 --> 00:13:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To do this one thing?

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:54.568 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: --to do this.

00:13:54.568 --> 00:13:56.300 align:middle line:90%
And now I'm done.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.610 align:middle line:90%
And where do I go from here?

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:02.950 align:middle line:84%
So he talked me down off the
ledge, which he's famous for.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.762 align:middle line:84%
And then he went back on home
to his house, in Florida,

00:14:06.762 --> 00:14:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and dropped me, in Georgia,
where I was living at the time.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.500 align:middle line:84%
I've since moved to
Florida, as well.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.602 align:middle line:90%
And he called me late one night.

00:14:14.602 --> 00:14:16.060 align:middle line:84%
It was like 11:00
o'clock at night.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.170 align:middle line:90%
And we talked late, often.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.570 align:middle line:90%
He's a night owl like I am.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:21.840 align:middle line:90%
So that wasn't unusual.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:84%
But he called to
see how I was doing.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.050 align:middle line:84%
He was picking up--
he's very sensitive.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.850 align:middle line:90%
He has great gifts himself.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And he just was picking
up on an energy that was

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:90%
making him a little nervous.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.300 align:middle line:90%
And he called me.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.591 align:middle line:90%
And he said, how are you doing?

00:14:35.591 --> 00:14:37.570 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, about the same.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, let
me tell you a story.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And for the next
two hours, George

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.610 align:middle line:84%
gave me incredible
details of the story

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.700 align:middle line:84%
that he had had in his
mind, as if it was literally

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.350 align:middle line:84%
planted overnight in a dream,
complete in its entirety.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And he had sat on it for
25 years, just left it

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:02.470 align:middle line:84%
in a compartment in the
back of his consciousness.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me every detail
of this story from start

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.910 align:middle line:90%
to finish.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.830 align:middle line:90%
It took more than two hours.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of it, the
tears are pouring down my face.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:90%
It's tough.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's--

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
very tough story.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: --not for
the faint of heart.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.661 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It's not for
the weak of stomach.

00:15:18.661 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: But I said, how
did you come up with this?

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it was given
to me as a gift, in total.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And I never did
anything with it.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:32.550 align:middle line:90%
I said, George--

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did he mean,
it was given to him as a gift?

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: He woke up one
morning, and it was there.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:37.260 align:middle line:90%
It was just there.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't when
he went to bed.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, I never
did anything with it.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a writer.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.510 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, I am.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And now I know what
my next job is.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And we spent 18
months turning what

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:56.550 align:middle line:84%
was just a raw,
draft idea, elongated

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.580 align:middle line:84%
and complicated and
dense and intense,

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:04.590 align:middle line:84%
into what has turned into
a novel that, worldwide,

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:84%
is garnering acclaim and getting
nothing but five-star reviews.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm so proud.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm so proud of him.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Because this was a huge leap
of faith for him to take.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Huge.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's challenging.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.115 align:middle line:84%
First of all, give us a little
bit about George's background.

00:16:20.115 --> 00:16:21.490 align:middle line:84%
He has an interesting
background.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: George has a very
interesting background.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And he began, as a young
man, going into the military

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and was sucked into
military intelligence.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Because he's so intelligent,
once they tested him,

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:84%
they said, OK,
you're going into--

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.180 align:middle line:90%
he was a translator.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.750 align:middle line:84%
He learned Russian,
fluently, in one year.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.160 align:middle line:90%
And he was a translator.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of
the individuals

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.440 align:middle line:84%
who helped break codes
and end the Cold War--

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.530 align:middle line:90%
a really remarkable background.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.830 align:middle line:90%
He is a genius.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.720 align:middle line:90%
He's a brilliant, brilliant man.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He has a passion
for history, as well?

00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: He does.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.320 align:middle line:90%
He does.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Because while he was in
Europe, he was in Germany,

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.150 align:middle line:84%
for several years, and
toured all over Europe

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:10.829 align:middle line:84%
and got to go into some of the
most spectacular venues that

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:12.525 align:middle line:90%
exist on the planet.

00:17:12.525 --> 00:17:15.000 align:middle line:84%
He picked up lots and
lots of different energy.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.339 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't even into
the paranormal then.

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:19.200 align:middle line:84%
He was just picking
up on the energy

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.140 align:middle line:84%
and the history of the people
that had lived and died

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.819 align:middle line:90%
in these places.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:27.839 align:middle line:84%
When he talks about going into
the German concentration camps,

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.870 align:middle line:84%
I can't even
discuss it with him.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Because the empath in
me just breaks down.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So he shared his whole,
entire history with me.

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:43.380 align:middle line:84%
He is an individual
that is so multifaceted,

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:84%
has so many different
talents and abilities.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:50.820 align:middle line:84%
He started his own radio
broadcasting network

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.620 align:middle line:90%
about nine years ago.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.110 align:middle line:90%
He just left it behind.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.420 align:middle line:84%
It was "Dead Air
Paranormal Radio."

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:84%
All the archives
are still there.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I did my show with him,
"A World Awakening,"

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.240 align:middle line:90%
for two and a half years.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And people can find
incredible broadcasts

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.740 align:middle line:84%
that we did with some of
the upper echelon of people

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.030 align:middle line:84%
in the paranormal, under
every spoke of the umbrella.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:18.030 align:middle line:84%
It was a great venture that
we loved doing together.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:84%
But he's now moving on
into experimentations

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.410 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:90%
And I'm doing the same thing.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
His are focused in
the spiritual realm.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:90%
And mine are focused in UFOlogy.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.630 align:middle line:84%
We're going to touch on that
at the end of this show.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.463 align:middle line:84%
Because I think we
probably have to have you

00:18:35.463 --> 00:18:37.979 align:middle line:84%
back for that story,
because it's mounting.

00:18:37.979 --> 00:18:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because, in his background,

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:84%
in intelligence, I happened
to be randomly speaking

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.420 align:middle line:84%
to someone, about a month
ago, in a conversation.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.770 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I was formerly
with military intelligence.

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking about
how, now, the way the NSA

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:84%
gathers information,
where it's all

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:84%
just virtual, just crunching
massive amounts of data.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:84%
They have stopped engaging the
intuitive process, the aspect

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.784 align:middle line:90%
of intelligence gathering.

00:19:03.784 --> 00:19:05.450 align:middle line:84%
It used to be boots
on the ground, where

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:09.150 align:middle line:84%
someone, like George, would
put pieces of the story

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:10.320 align:middle line:90%
and evidence together.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.194 align:middle line:84%
And then they create a
trail, which you would

00:19:12.194 --> 00:19:13.440 align:middle line:90%
have to do in code breaking.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.090 align:middle line:90%
It's not just mechanical.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So he clearly was well-suited,
on an intuitive level,

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:21.390 align:middle line:84%
as well as an intelligence
level, for his past

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.430 align:middle line:90%
and for creating this book.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.130 align:middle line:84%
So "In a Flicker,"
we're going to start

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.570 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of the book.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to ask you
something about the dedication.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Because when we get into
the foundation of the story,

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.980 align:middle line:84%
it's about trying to maintain
timelines of history.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And it gets entangled
with the story

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.085 align:middle line:90%
of Jack the Ripper, right?

00:19:41.085 --> 00:19:41.885 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:19:41.885 --> 00:19:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So people kind of
know how that story goes a bit.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So it says it's dedicated
to the women of history,

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.650 align:middle line:90%
who make history.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:51.150 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, what?

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
exactly what that meant.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Because the women were
victims in this case.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:01.140 align:middle line:90%
What was I not hearing in this?

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, all these years
later, it's not 1888 anymore.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.290 align:middle line:90%
It's 2016.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And when people think of the
story of Jack the Ripper,

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.910 align:middle line:90%
he gets all the attention.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.210 align:middle line:84%
But ask anybody on
the street if they

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.340 align:middle line:90%
know the names of his victims.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.720 align:middle line:90%
And they don't.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were the ones that
paid, with their lives,

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.990 align:middle line:90%
for his fame and infamy.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I tell people, when
they get to the end of the,

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.200 align:middle line:84%
book go back and
reread the dedication.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And you will have an entirely
different perspective on it

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and a reflection upon what
these women's lives were like

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and what they endured
and how they died.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:84%
This story is
gruesome and beautiful

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and exotic and
erotic and horrific.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:57.220 align:middle line:84%
The worst of it comes directly
from the annals of history.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there are
many elements of it.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.321 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting amalgamation
of fact and fiction.

00:21:03.321 --> 00:21:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, it's
interesting, yes.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes, it's a history.

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a murder mystery.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.900 align:middle line:84%
But it's also historical
and absolutely accurate

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:90%
in terms of that.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.930 align:middle line:84%
But this story
involves the pyramids.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.420 align:middle line:90%
It involves CERN in Switzerland.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.850 align:middle line:90%
It involves time travel.

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:84%
It involves every-- anybody that
reads this book will experience

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.750 align:middle line:84%
every single human emotion
possible by the time they

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.430 align:middle line:90%
leave its pages.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And I tell folks, all the
time, I dare you to jump,

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:44.430 align:middle line:84%
just leap into the deep
end of the human psyche.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And when you come up at the
end of it, gasping for air,

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.060 align:middle line:84%
you won't be the same
person who went in.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I had
to be a part of this.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Because, when he told me the
story initially, I thought,

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.120 align:middle line:84%
well, this is just as gruesome
and horrible as it gets.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.760 align:middle line:84%
It makes "House of
Darkness, House of Light,"

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.590 align:middle line:90%
look like a fairy tale.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know if I even
wanted to be involved at first.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.310 align:middle line:90%
I had to think about it.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:15.720 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to help him.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.760 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to see it go
out into the world,

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.110 align:middle line:84%
because of its ability to
expand human consciousness,

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.680 align:middle line:84%
because of its ability
to force people to look

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.090 align:middle line:90%
at man's inhumanity to woman.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Boy, and it does it.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It does.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is--
this is actually--

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.941 align:middle line:90%
I'm-- it's-- really--

00:22:34.941 --> 00:22:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I see the pain in
your eyes just talking about it.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
yeah, it's painful.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.540 align:middle line:84%
But it's also been occurring
to me, more and more,

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.310 align:middle line:84%
as the time has gone
on, and certainly

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:90%
in the last couple of years--

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not-- I'm not
into this from any kind

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.270 align:middle line:90%
of feminist point of view.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:52.410 align:middle line:90%
It's simply a reality--

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and this book brings
it up to the max--

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.600 align:middle line:84%
that the patriarchy
has run its course.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.290 align:middle line:84%
It has done a horrid
disservice to this planet.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.750 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
that is occurring

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:06.090 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, of a
dysfunctional and destructive

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:08.007 align:middle line:84%
nature, that did not
come from the patriarchy.

00:23:08.007 --> 00:23:08.965 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: That's right.

00:23:08.965 --> 00:23:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this
is almost like, if you

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:15.000 align:middle line:84%
want to put the final nail
in the lid of that coffin,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.350 align:middle line:90%
this should do it.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And now we have to turn
the boat around, all of us.

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: This is the rise of
the new sacred feminine energy.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not new.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:25.620 align:middle line:90%
It's ancient.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.850 align:middle line:90%
You're a part of it.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.230 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a part of it.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And I knew, as much as I
was willing to edit his work

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:37.680 align:middle line:84%
or be involved on that
level, within 24 hours,

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I knew I had to help
him co-write this book,

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:44.580 align:middle line:84%
that I had to bring the
feminine perspective to it.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.770 align:middle line:90%
And we fought like--

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.200 align:middle line:90%
cats and dogs had nothing on us.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean there are edges in
this that are so sharp,

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:56.280 align:middle line:84%
it feels like they
cut your throat open.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
I'll just buff them,

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and I'll soften
them a little bit.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.570 align:middle line:90%
And maybe-- no, no, no.

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:05.622 align:middle line:90%
I won a few arguments.

00:24:05.622 --> 00:24:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But mostly, he won.

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: But mostly, he won.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.320 align:middle line:90%
But he needed to.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:90%
And he was right.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.370 align:middle line:90%
Because it has to shock you.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:18.060 align:middle line:90%
It has to open your third eye.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:23.250 align:middle line:84%
It has to make you explore
your own human emotions.

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.770 align:middle line:84%
There are some people
that have read this book

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:84%
and have literally
said, what you've

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.170 align:middle line:84%
written here is
raising the dead,

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:36.730 align:middle line:84%
is breathing new life
into these women.

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:38.250 align:middle line:90%
They're no longer victims.

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:39.810 align:middle line:90%
They are now the victors.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Because you gave them the power
to make their own presence

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.170 align:middle line:90%
known in the world again.

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:49.050 align:middle line:84%
They were forgotten in
the annals of history.

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Except for the few real
aficionados, of the Jack the

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Ripper horrific history,
they were lost to history.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.500 align:middle line:90%
And now they're not, anymore.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is,
sadly, these conditions

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:07.980 align:middle line:84%
exist around the world in
some places that are, perhaps,

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:10.239 align:middle line:90%
more socially less developed.

00:25:10.239 --> 00:25:11.280 align:middle line:90%
They happen all the time.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And these women's names,
they're never heard of, ever,

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:15.295 align:middle line:90%
millions and millions--

00:25:15.295 --> 00:25:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Millions and millions.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --of women.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And it's
about to come to an end.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.160 align:middle line:84%
This is evil's last
stand on this planet.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.251 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Think about the
women that have been abducted

00:25:24.251 --> 00:25:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and the girls abducted and used
as sex slaves by Boko Haram,

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.400 align:middle line:90%
by ISIL, by on and on and on.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.240 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I hope they all get it
out of their system now,

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:34.847 align:middle line:90%
because this is it.

00:25:34.847 --> 00:25:35.680 align:middle line:90%
The paradigm shift--

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.096 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm feeling.

00:25:37.096 --> 00:25:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: --is under way now.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:40.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling the same thing.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's like we
have to, maybe, just

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:84%
stand in that last bit
of darkness to say,

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.490 align:middle line:84%
this is unacceptable, as
a species, from this point

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:48.290 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Because, from
the depths of the darkness

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:55.850 align:middle line:84%
emerges the light, and the
enlightenment for humanity.

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I had to
be part of "In a Flicker."

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's get into
the story a little bit.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going
to give too much away,

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.264 align:middle line:84%
because this story builds, so
you can't tell the whole plot.

00:26:04.264 --> 00:26:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And we wouldn't
have time, anyway.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.890 align:middle line:84%
But it starts with the
Princess Di accident scene.

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:10.220 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, because the
scientists, the professors,

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.880 align:middle line:84%
the people who are working
on recreating history,

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.270 align:middle line:84%
so that they can accurately
retell it, are going,

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:84%
case-by-case, through
history, according

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.315 align:middle line:84%
to which professors want to
be part of the consortium

00:26:29.315 --> 00:26:32.920 align:middle line:84%
and want to be part of what's
going on in the valley.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.800 align:middle line:84%
It's all set at
Oxford University,

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:39.920 align:middle line:84%
in England, until we
get into the Switzerland

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.760 align:middle line:90%
end of things with CERN.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's about
maintaining the timeline

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.180 align:middle line:84%
but also ascertaining the
proper and accurate timeline.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Because you know and I know that
the vast majority of written

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:84%
history is written
by the victors.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And so
it is really not

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.780 align:middle line:84%
necessarily accurate
in the extreme.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And so these great thinkers,
who are focused on history,

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:11.140 align:middle line:84%
want to recreate what they
can, so that they can determine

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.940 align:middle line:90%
if it was indeed an accident.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:16.420 align:middle line:84%
If it wasn't, who was
the culprit and how?

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And yet the opening
scenes of this book

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.320 align:middle line:84%
will just grab you by the
heart if are old enough

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.485 align:middle line:84%
to remember the day that she
died, that night that she died.

00:27:26.485 --> 00:27:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And most people--

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It is a revisiting
of it to the n-th degree,

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.220 align:middle line:90%
to the most minute detail.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And it drags you, kicking
and screaming, into the story

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.190 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
you can't breathe.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.220 align:middle line:84%
I tell people all the
time, buy the soft-bound.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're ready to
throw this book against a wall,

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.120 align:middle line:90%
you won't break the binding.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.220 align:middle line:84%
You can pick it up and
pick up where you left off.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's important,
too, because it's

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:57.070 align:middle line:84%
something that doesn't allow
you to escape its pages.

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:59.500 align:middle line:84%
You have to go through
to the end of it,

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.999 align:middle line:84%
because it is such a really,
truly, compelling story.

00:28:02.999 --> 00:28:04.540 align:middle line:84%
But that's the reason
that it starts,

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.610 align:middle line:84%
because that's how
it introduces--

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were able
to draw in immediately.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Right.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:12.550 align:middle line:84%
--how it introduces them to
this covert, secretive program

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:16.990 align:middle line:84%
of historical exploration
that's going on at the time.

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So over this voice--

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:23.020 align:middle line:84%
so we're seeing this scene,
right, this historical scene?

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.479 align:middle line:84%
And then over the speakers comes
the voice, clear and reset.

00:28:26.479 --> 00:28:27.520 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does this mean?

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Where does "clear
and reset" come in?

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.251 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

00:28:30.251 --> 00:28:31.750 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRON: Well,
what they were doing

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.120 align:middle line:10%
is probability and statistics.

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:38.020 align:middle line:10%
And all of it was being filtered
through a giant computer

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.260 align:middle line:10%
brain that was saying, OK,
this has happened, now,

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:45.940 align:middle line:10%
this exact way four times
or five times or six times.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:51.010 align:middle line:84%
So now we know this is, based
on probability and statistics,

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:55.990 align:middle line:84%
this is most likely why she
died and how it happened.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:29:00.160 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning, the question
is, was the driver impaired?

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Did he side-swipe
that little car?

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Did he lose control
of the vehicle?

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Was there a mechanical issue?

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.810 align:middle line:90%
Was it the paparazzi?

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Was it death by paparazzi?

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk about
the book's findings on it,

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:13.990 align:middle line:90%
where the book came with it.

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Or should we not
talk about that?

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.509 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, I think we'll
leave that to the reader

00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:19.675 align:middle line:90%
to determine for themselves.

00:29:19.675 --> 00:29:20.925 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We'll just leave it.

00:29:20.925 --> 00:29:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So now we get to the FTC,
which is not the Federal Trade

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Commission, it is the
Flicker Trial Consortium.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what that group
is and what their charge is.

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Their charge is all
about CERN and what's going on.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.640 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
conspiracy theories

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.100 align:middle line:84%
about CERN and
accidents are happening,

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.150 align:middle line:90%
things are happening.

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, this book is set in
2020 and deliberately so,

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:51.160 align:middle line:90%
as in 20/20 hindsight.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:56.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's really about a project
that comes to them quite

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.730 align:middle line:90%
by accident.

00:29:57.730 --> 00:29:59.920 align:middle line:90%
And there are no accidents.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And something occurs,
at the facility,

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:08.440 align:middle line:84%
at CERN, that opens a window,
opens a door to the past.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And Professor Ethan LaPierre
feels absolutely compelled,

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:17.110 align:middle line:84%
wanting to know, who
was Jack the Ripper?

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Why was he never
identified in history?

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:24.335 align:middle line:84%
Why were there 30-plus
suspects, more suspects

00:30:24.335 --> 00:30:26.060 align:middle line:90%
than there were victims?

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And yet no one was
charged with the crime.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.380 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:36.870 align:middle line:84%
This book offers a plausible
explanation for why.

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Now the CERN piece of
it I find interesting.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.060 align:middle line:84%
I did an interview,
recently, with someone

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.000 align:middle line:84%
that was talking about parallel
timelines, where CERN had been

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.130 align:middle line:84%
brought up,
repeatedly, as having

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:52.910 align:middle line:84%
some function that seems to be
able to bend time and space.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, they're
looking for the god particle.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: They're
looking-- they're looking

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.359 align:middle line:90%
for everything simultaneously.

00:31:00.359 --> 00:31:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they don't
know what they're doing.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.066 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what
they're opening up.

00:31:04.066 --> 00:31:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Well, I wouldn't say--

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.490 align:middle line:84%
I would hesitate
to say that they

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:08.600 align:middle line:90%
don't know what they're doing.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You think they do?

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: The greatest
minds on the planet

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:15.680 align:middle line:84%
are all working, in
unison, in one facility,

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.320 align:middle line:90%
on a multitude of projects.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.634 align:middle line:90%
And so, I know it's--

00:31:19.634 --> 00:31:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but if
they're looking for something

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.216 align:middle line:84%
called the "god
particle," they're

00:31:23.216 --> 00:31:24.680 align:middle line:84%
already looking in
the wrong place.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.810 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to find
it in physical reality

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:29.690 align:middle line:90%
even down to boson level, right?

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, we've already
explored the quark theorem.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:35.240 align:middle line:90%
We've already explored the--

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.340 align:middle line:84%
quantum mechanics,
quantum physics

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.590 align:middle line:84%
is making leaps
and bounds daily--

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:43.010 align:middle line:84%
not weekly, not monthly,
not yearly, daily.

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And so what they're doing
is they're trying to create,

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.750 align:middle line:84%
set up a machination,
as it were,

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:59.300 align:middle line:84%
to recreate the exact formula
to explore and open new doors

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.520 align:middle line:90%
to multiple dimensions.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.615 align:middle line:84%
And it's very dangerous,
what they're doing.

00:32:03.615 --> 00:32:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Because they
are dabbling in things

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.080 align:middle line:84%
that humanity, to
our knowledge, based

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.689 align:middle line:84%
on our own recorded history,
has never dabbled in before.

00:32:11.689 --> 00:32:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't know
the implications of it.

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: They don't necessarily
know the implications of it,

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.820 align:middle line:84%
which is actually, as
far as I am concerned,

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:22.884 align:middle line:84%
one of the most frightful
elements of this book.

00:32:22.884 --> 00:32:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And also, because
it's a discipline--

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:31.580 align:middle line:84%
it's the discipline
of science, you

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.470 align:middle line:84%
could even say scientific
materialism in the mindset,

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:35.270 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:36.145 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Absolutely.

00:32:36.145 --> 00:32:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're not bringing
the ancient understandings

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:42.010 align:middle line:84%
of the realms and what exists
in these other dimensions

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:42.810 align:middle line:90%
and realms.

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:45.050 align:middle line:84%
They're not bringing that
into part of the conversation

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:45.780 align:middle line:90%
that I'm aware of.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No.

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
don't know what

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.970 align:middle line:90%
they're conjuring, literally.

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Exactly,
perfect word choice.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.800 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
George and I do together

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.160 align:middle line:84%
is we lecture at different
venues around the country.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And our lecture is
called, "The merging

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:02.720 align:middle line:90%
of Science and Spirituality."

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And both of us believe,
firmly, that it

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.740 align:middle line:84%
will, as Nikola Tesla said,
be the merging of these two

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:13.710 align:middle line:84%
distinct disciplines that
will begin to really answer

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:14.510 align:middle line:90%
questions for us.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:15.384 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:15.384 --> 00:33:16.890 align:middle line:90%
You have to use both.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:18.380 align:middle line:90%
And we are attempting.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:22.520 align:middle line:84%
So many of us are attempting
to do that one day at a time.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.380 align:middle line:84%
One interview, in my
case, at the time.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.270 align:middle line:90%
So now a portal is open.

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.670 align:middle line:90%
Now we want to get into--

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:30.980 align:middle line:84%
there's vetting for these events
and re-enactments going on.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how
this story sets up

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:37.340 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the academic
rigor, which goes awry.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, the academic
rigor, as far as everyone

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:45.590 align:middle line:84%
involved with the FTC, is
of penultimate importance,

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:48.890 align:middle line:84%
because they want to make
sure that any candidate that

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:53.420 align:middle line:84%
might step through this portal
is absolutely, completely

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.690 align:middle line:84%
prepared not to
disrupt the timeline

00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:59.120 align:middle line:90%
in any conceivable way.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And so therein lies the
human element of it.

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Because, basically, what they're
asking these scientists to do

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.909 align:middle line:84%
is to suspend
their own humanity,

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:16.100 align:middle line:90%
their own emotional makeup.

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:19.550 align:middle line:84%
They're asking them to, for
all intents and purposes,

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:22.610 align:middle line:84%
observe, as a machine
would, as a computer would.

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.219 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like CERN.

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:26.254 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And of
course, because they

00:34:26.254 --> 00:34:28.909 align:middle line:90%
are humans, that backfires.

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:30.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:32.130 align:middle line:84%
So there were some
trials before this.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Now they've chosen
some candidates

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:35.810 align:middle line:90%
that can be worked with.

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:37.130 align:middle line:90%
Ethan LaPierre, right?

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:43.845 align:middle line:84%
Ethan LaPierre being our primary
protagonist in the story,

00:34:43.845 --> 00:34:44.645 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:34:44.645 --> 00:34:45.445 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:34:45.445 --> 00:34:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they choose
him, in particular, because--

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:52.730 align:middle line:84%
well, let's go back
to the three incidents

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:54.679 align:middle line:84%
before, because I
think the Cox paradox

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:56.870 align:middle line:90%
and such really sets this up.

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:58.250 align:middle line:90%
So let's go to the first trial.

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.530 align:middle line:84%
They've done these trials
with this portal before.

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:05.010 align:middle line:84%
The first trial was Van Ruden
accidentally killed a man.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:06.380 align:middle line:90%
This was during World War II?

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A Japanese
man, dragged him

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.800 align:middle line:90%
back into his timeline, right?

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And had to somehow get
him back into his own timeline.

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:18.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean this was, yeah,
a difficult affair.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And then the
Cox paradox, of course--

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.158 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
the next person.

00:35:22.158 --> 00:35:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: --was the
most fascinating for me

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:25.570 align:middle line:90%
to work with.

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:27.322 align:middle line:90%
Because here was a man, who--

00:35:27.322 --> 00:35:29.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to give
too much of it away.

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:30.905 align:middle line:84%
I think it's one of the
most compelling parts

00:35:30.905 --> 00:35:31.740 align:middle line:90%
of the whole story.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I agree.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: But he had a
crisis of conscience.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And so every time one
of these incidents

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:43.990 align:middle line:84%
occurred, the precursors
to Ethan's jump,

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:46.420 align:middle line:84%
they learned more
and more and more

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:49.420 align:middle line:84%
about the flaws
and the frailties

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:50.665 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:35:50.665 --> 00:35:52.915 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the human
interface with the technology.

00:35:52.915 --> 00:35:53.715 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:35:53.715 --> 00:35:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And thought that they had
covered all of their bases.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And even Ethan said,
before he made his move,

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.710 align:middle line:84%
there's always something
that got missed.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So Ethan,
he is an introvert.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.795 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: An introvert,
a pragmatist,

00:36:10.795 --> 00:36:11.920 align:middle line:90%
a brilliant, brilliant man.

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Braniac doesn't
have much of a social life.

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doesn't have
much of an intimate life.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.520 align:middle line:90%


00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean just setting him up
as an ideal candidate because

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:25.930 align:middle line:84%
of this thing that had
been learned about fear

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:27.670 align:middle line:90%
and about trepidation.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:31.340 align:middle line:84%
That can set someone up
as an ideal candidate.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.140 align:middle line:90%
It can.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:33.940 align:middle line:84%
We won't go into any
further than that.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.150 align:middle line:84%
So they thought, well, this
is a Walter Mitty kind of guy.

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:40.690 align:middle line:84%
He might be ideal to go in and
start researching and observing

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:44.650 align:middle line:84%
what happened,
back in the times,

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.780 align:middle line:90%
in the life of Jack the Ripper.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:50.230 align:middle line:90%
So let's pick it up from there.

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Well, he encounters--

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:55.750 align:middle line:84%
not only is he
fascinated, absolutely

00:36:55.750 --> 00:37:00.400 align:middle line:84%
fascinated with the history and
the mystery of stepping back

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:04.810 align:middle line:84%
into East End,
London, 1888, his mind

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:08.650 align:middle line:84%
is blown wide open
the moment that he

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:10.300 align:middle line:90%
steps through the portal.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And just the smell of the
city brings him to his knees.

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:17.920 align:middle line:84%
It causes him to
retch uncontrollably.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.310 align:middle line:84%
He has literally moved
from one environment, where

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:23.350 align:middle line:90%
the air was pure and clean--

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Clinical.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Clinical, literally.

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:29.512 align:middle line:84%
--into the stench
and the squalor of--

00:37:29.512 --> 00:37:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can't fathom.

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: --East
End, London, 1888.

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And then he begins to encounter
a whole series of characters.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And he's supposed
to be functioning

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:42.910 align:middle line:84%
as a background character,
kind of lost in the mix.

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He called the scope--

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.640 align:middle line:90%
kind of the scope--

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: There is an observer,
as in microscope or telescope,

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:51.250 align:middle line:90%
looking at some distance.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And finds himself being
drawn in and almost

00:37:55.540 --> 00:38:01.180 align:middle line:84%
interacting in comical ways
with some of the characters

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.400 align:middle line:90%
that he encounters.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.995 align:middle line:90%
And then everything changes.

00:38:05.995 --> 00:38:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well he
starts encountering

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.310 align:middle line:84%
the players in the
story, right, Maggie,

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:11.680 align:middle line:90%
a pseudonym, prostitute?

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And if I give you any more
than that, at this point,

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:19.870 align:middle line:84%
it might spoil the
read for someone.

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:23.380 align:middle line:84%
But I will tell our
listeners, today,

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.630 align:middle line:84%
just when they're
certain they've

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:29.290 align:middle line:84%
got this figured out, they get
hit upside the head with a two

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:30.370 align:middle line:90%
by four.

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And that happens over
and over and over again.

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and I think
it's important to mention,

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.470 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think it really
gives the story away, too much,

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:39.270 align:middle line:90%
personally.

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:43.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's so
much more in it.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.120 align:middle line:84%
As I said in the
open, Ethan LaPierre

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:50.680 align:middle line:84%
becomes more than entangled,
completely entangled

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.770 align:middle line:84%
into this timeline
and story and starts

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.710 align:middle line:84%
making decisions and taking
matters into his own hands.

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:59.470 align:middle line:84%
He's supposed to be
an observer only.

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's not
how it turns out.

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out all of
those hidden desires,

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:11.140 align:middle line:84%
within his own Walter Mitty
like character, start surfacing.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And the dark side of humanity
starts showing its face

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.140 align:middle line:84%
through him, all this
that's suppressed,

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:21.790 align:middle line:84%
that is suppressed in millions
of people walking around.

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And the really
interesting question

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:28.940 align:middle line:84%
is, what is it in a person that
is trying to find its way out

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.160 align:middle line:90%
that could even end up--

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.430 align:middle line:90%
and granted, this is fiction.

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: But it's not, really.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.835 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not really.

00:39:35.835 --> 00:39:37.510 align:middle line:84%
We just talked
earlier about crimes

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:39.130 align:middle line:84%
against humanity
and, particularly,

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:41.530 align:middle line:84%
against the women of the planet
throughout history, certainly,

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:42.988 align:middle line:84%
in the last several
thousand years,

00:39:42.988 --> 00:39:44.980 align:middle line:84%
anyway, a few
thousand to be sure.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: If we
are a human being,

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:53.710 align:middle line:84%
then we are comprised of a very
complicated mix of emotion.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:59.370 align:middle line:84%
We are comprised of a very
complicated mix of intentions.

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And depending on
all the variables,

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:04.750 align:middle line:84%
how we were raised,
who we've encountered,

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:08.260 align:middle line:84%
I think that it is fair to
say that any one of us--

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you and I are
considered practically

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:15.260 align:middle line:84%
walking light beings
on this planet.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.630 align:middle line:90%
And yet I know--

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:23.530 align:middle line:84%
I know-- that should someone
hurt one of my loved ones,

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:25.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm capable of murder.

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, no
question in my mind,

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:32.230 align:middle line:84%
and would feel absolutely
validated and vindicated

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:35.060 align:middle line:84%
in wiping the pestilence
from the planet.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:39.041 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not very
enlightened, as it were.

00:40:39.041 --> 00:40:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is also part
of the human survival.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It's part of
the human condition.

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a conditioning
and survival mechanism.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And we do understand that,
that protective aspect

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:51.580 align:middle line:84%
of being an animal as well
as a being, the human being,

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:55.210 align:middle line:90%
which is a very complex matrix.

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:57.490 align:middle line:84%
What I found interesting
in this story

00:40:57.490 --> 00:41:00.964 align:middle line:84%
is that, in Ethan's
being drawn into this--

00:41:00.964 --> 00:41:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and he had studied
it quite a bit,

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.090 align:middle line:84%
so he knew what the
story was about.

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:05.631 align:middle line:84%
He already knew who
the players were.

00:41:05.631 --> 00:41:08.800 align:middle line:90%
He'd studied it, historically.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.240 align:middle line:84%
While the project was so
committed to nonintervention,

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:17.500 align:middle line:84%
and he became
involved, what was it

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:22.200 align:middle line:84%
that it would defy his
own morality in this?

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: His imperative
to maintain the timeline

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.269 align:middle line:90%
at all cost.

00:41:27.269 --> 00:41:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in
becoming engaged in it,

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.606 align:middle line:90%
he wasn't maintaining it.

00:41:32.606 --> 00:41:33.730 align:middle line:90%
He was interfering with it.

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: He was
interfering with it.

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:40.004 align:middle line:84%
He was interfering
with it by necessity.

00:41:40.004 --> 00:41:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
interesting if you just look

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:50.092 align:middle line:84%
from more of a shadowy
military point of view,

00:41:50.092 --> 00:41:51.824 align:middle line:84%
potentially playing
with teleportation.

00:41:51.824 --> 00:41:53.740 align:middle line:84%
It's been said this has
been done for a while.

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Playing with timelines,
all these things

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.760 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.980 align:middle line:84%
The elite, as
shadowy agencies, are

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:03.590 align:middle line:84%
fully aware of all of our
capabilities in these areas.

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And I can't help but
think, especially

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.350 align:middle line:84%
with George having had an
intelligence background

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:12.220 align:middle line:84%
and military, himself, that
some of this isn't actually--

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:15.580 align:middle line:84%
these are philosophical dilemmas
that are actually occurring

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.730 align:middle line:90%
within these agencies.

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, interesting
that you should go there.

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:27.760 align:middle line:84%
I personally think
that we know about 1%

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.850 align:middle line:90%
of what's actually going on.

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:34.480 align:middle line:84%
The last thing that
President Eisenhower

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.180 align:middle line:84%
said before he left
office was beware

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.966 align:middle line:84%
the military industrial
establishment.

00:42:38.966 --> 00:42:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I think that the
human race has made advancements

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:52.690 align:middle line:84%
far beyond our ability to
even imagine what's going on.

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of what
I study UFOlogy, as well,

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:59.980 align:middle line:84%
and some of my own
intuitive abilities.

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:06.130 align:middle line:84%
I feel quite certain that
there are scientific hypotheses

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:11.320 align:middle line:84%
and theorems that are already
not only beyond the testing

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.577 align:middle line:90%
phase but in use right now.

00:43:13.577 --> 00:43:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I believe
so, as well, and I

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.872 align:middle line:84%
have spoken with some people in
interviews about these things.

00:43:17.872 --> 00:43:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's
always speculation,

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.955 align:middle line:84%
because no one involved is ever
going to step up and say, yeah,

00:43:21.955 --> 00:43:23.380 align:middle line:90%
we've been doing that.

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.210 align:middle line:90%
So it still remains speculative.

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:28.090 align:middle line:84%
But it remains likely
in my mind, likely.

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And looking at this
cajoling, of his own

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:37.570 align:middle line:84%
rationalizing to himself that
he can do what he ends up doing,

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:40.860 align:middle line:84%
as a result of staying
true to the timeline.

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And this directive from
authority, so to speak,

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.850 align:middle line:84%
reminds me-- when
I was reading, it

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:48.880 align:middle line:84%
reminded me of an
experience I had years ago,

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.904 align:middle line:84%
where a friend talked
me into going to this.

00:43:50.904 --> 00:43:52.070 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're going to love it.

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:53.120 align:middle line:90%
It's so profound.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:56.290 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, I'm really easy going.

00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:57.880 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even ask much about it.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.830 align:middle line:84%
She just said, it's
starting tomorrow night.

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:01.870 align:middle line:84%
I've already told
them that it would

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:03.040 align:middle line:90%
be great to have you there.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:03.840 align:middle line:90%
And OK.

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, I didn't know it
was an EST kind of thing.

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.190 align:middle line:90%
But it was different.

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:13.000 align:middle line:84%
It was tailored to this
one man's belief of how

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.130 align:middle line:90%
you effect change in a person.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:16.600 align:middle line:90%
So it was a group of 17 people.

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.630 align:middle line:90%
And I only bring it up.

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:20.930 align:middle line:84%
It ended up being
something like eight days.

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was truly profound,
because you could see

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.990 align:middle line:90%
how humanity is manipulated.

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular exercise,
toward the end of the eight

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:34.720 align:middle line:84%
days, very smooth, the leader
of this group is saying,

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:37.540 align:middle line:90%
now, I hate this exercise.

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:38.680 align:middle line:90%
But we need to do this.

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.950 align:middle line:84%
It's really important that
you follow these instructions

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:42.830 align:middle line:90%
and blah, blah, blah.

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:46.930 align:middle line:84%
So he puts on a soundtrack
that is incredibly violent.

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And it has soundtracks
from radio clips

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:52.840 align:middle line:84%
from all the assassinations
of the '60s and other things

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and very discordant
music on top.

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:55.916 align:middle line:90%
So it was disturbing.

00:44:55.916 --> 00:44:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I want
you to choose a partner

00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.540 align:middle line:84%
and stand across
from one another.

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And when the time comes, I
want you to raise your hand.

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And when the time comes,
I'm going to count.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I do, you're to
strike the other person

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.420 align:middle line:90%
in front of you.

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.100 align:middle line:90%
And he says this, right?

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:15.217 align:middle line:84%
And I tend not to be
very easily programmed.

00:45:15.217 --> 00:45:17.050 align:middle line:84%
If it's not in alignment
with my conscience,

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:18.049 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what it is.

00:45:18.049 --> 00:45:21.190 align:middle line:84%
I've never actually been
cajoled into doing anything.

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:23.555 align:middle line:84%
And so, in that case, I
did not raise my hand.

00:45:23.555 --> 00:45:26.090 align:middle line:84%
But shockingly, I
was the only person

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:27.950 align:middle line:84%
in the room that
didn't raise my hand.

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And the woman across
from me was sobbing,

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:34.460 align:middle line:84%
because this man is
telling her to strike

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:36.680 align:middle line:90%
me, who's done nothing to her.

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And she is compelled
to follow orders.

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.202 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes, human condition.

00:45:41.202 --> 00:45:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Human conditioning.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:43.640 align:middle line:90%
And she has her hand up.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:44.900 align:middle line:90%
And she's larger than I am.

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.400 align:middle line:90%
And she's ready to do it.

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And then boom, he stops the
music and stops everything.

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And he says, now
you understand how

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.680 align:middle line:84%
people are cajoled into doing
every atrocity in history.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.990 align:middle line:90%
It's this simple.

00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Just like the
character in your book,

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:00.830 align:middle line:90%
trying to follow these orders.

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Getting all screwed
up within them,

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.650 align:middle line:84%
but trying to follow
these orders out, right?

00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so I did.

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.370 align:middle line:90%
I really reflected back on that.

00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, we are so easy,
as a species, to manipulate.

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Incredibly gullible.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:12.905 align:middle line:90%
Incredibly.

00:46:12.905 --> 00:46:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Incredibly gullible.

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Easily manipulated.

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Perceptions
of authority.

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah.

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, this is
hard, because so much of it

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:23.960 align:middle line:84%
does go into the plot, and I
don't want to give it away.

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:28.010 align:middle line:84%
But one thing, here,
that's very interesting

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:30.170 align:middle line:84%
about the whole Ripper
case, in general.

00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is really more
kind of brain chemistry.

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:36.410 align:middle line:84%
The centers in the brain,
in the limbic system, that

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:38.390 align:middle line:84%
have to do with violence
sit very closely,

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:40.470 align:middle line:84%
with the centers that
have to do with sexuality.

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that is
why, in times of stress,

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:48.846 align:middle line:84%
in times of war, rape and
such become, historically,

00:46:48.846 --> 00:46:50.720 align:middle line:84%
a big part of the agenda,
because those parts

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:53.810 align:middle line:84%
of the brain centers
are firing together.

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:55.492 align:middle line:90%
It's not about sex even.

00:46:55.492 --> 00:46:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No, it's not.

00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:57.090 align:middle line:90%
It's about power--

00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's about power.

00:46:57.590 --> 00:46:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: --and control.

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Power and control
and basic survival within that.

00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And dehumanizing
and victimizing

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.040 align:middle line:84%
those that you
intend to control.

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's one of the things.

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:15.020 align:middle line:84%
I know you have used the f-word,
feminist, a little while ago.

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:17.780 align:middle line:90%
I make no bones about it.

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm out all over the
world as what would be

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:24.860 align:middle line:90%
considered a radical feminist.

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And I get called that, because
I have radical ideas, like women

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.765 align:middle line:84%
should be paid equal
for their work.

00:47:34.765 --> 00:47:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How novel.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah, a novel idea.

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.790 align:middle line:90%


00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:44.390 align:middle line:84%
There should be equivalency in
all elements of all society,

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that women should
not be, in any way,

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:49.460 align:middle line:84%
relegated or subjugated
beneath any male that

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.350 align:middle line:90%
walks this planet.

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:53.190 align:middle line:90%
I am a voice for the voiceless.

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I am the defender
of the defenseless.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.880 align:middle line:90%
I am just rabid.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean people think
she's so sweet.

00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:03.678 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they've never seen me angry.

00:48:03.678 --> 00:48:05.844 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I wouldn't want
to be on that side of you.

00:48:05.844 --> 00:48:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: They never have
seen me watch a news report

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:15.500 align:middle line:84%
about some little girl that's
been abducted and dismembered.

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.330 align:middle line:90%
And I lose it.

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:20.030 align:middle line:90%
When I'm done screaming, I cry.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:21.800 align:middle line:90%
Because I feel it, too.

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:26.990 align:middle line:84%
I have this innate ability
to feel the pain of humanity.

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And there are times that
I simply have to block it,

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:32.720 align:middle line:84%
because it's so
overwhelming to me.

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine,
on the final read

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:39.110 align:middle line:84%
through of this book, when
George and I were sitting

00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:42.620 align:middle line:84%
in the same room, together,
reading it, word for word,

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:48.080 align:middle line:84%
line for line, after 18 months
of working in this manuscript,

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:51.860 align:middle line:84%
I would still get to places in
this book where I was sobbing.

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And he would have to
pick up where I left off.

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:56.585 align:middle line:90%
Because I couldn't talk anymore.

00:48:56.585 --> 00:48:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well I
understand that.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And as kind of a larger
view coming out of this

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:06.470 align:middle line:84%
and talking about the
notion, what we need to have

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:11.570 align:middle line:84%
is basic human rights now,
human rights, for all humans.

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Women's
rights are human rights.

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're human rights.

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:20.390 align:middle line:84%
The patriarchy-- I had
this debate with a man.

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Kind of loosely speaking, he was
Christian but not practicing.

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:27.680 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you find
that there was anything

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:30.830 align:middle line:84%
that the patriarchy really
served this planet, I mean,

00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:32.030 align:middle line:90%
looking at it?

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm always
looking for large themes.

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.316 align:middle line:84%
Even if it doesn't look like
it serves, sometimes it does.

00:49:36.316 --> 00:49:40.340 align:middle line:84%
He said, I think it served
creating a linear context

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:44.631 align:middle line:84%
for reintroducing technology
and such back into humanity.

00:49:44.631 --> 00:49:46.130 align:middle line:84%
He said, I think
it served for that.

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think, and all other
levels, it did not serve.

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:49.450 align:middle line:90%
It denigrated.

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:51.449 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I don't even
think it served for that.

00:49:51.449 --> 00:49:53.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean when you denigrate
and you take the greatest

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.970 align:middle line:84%
female minds that
ever lived, and then

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:57.220 align:middle line:90%
take their work and claim--

00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Einstein's wife.

00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: --it as your own.

00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Einstein's wife?

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I know.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean how few
women inventors, how

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:06.810 align:middle line:84%
few women scientists ever got
the credit that they deserved.

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:08.750 align:middle line:84%
They were usurped
by some man that

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:12.260 align:middle line:84%
was working beside them or
even beneath them, who claimed

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:13.260 align:middle line:90%
their work as their own.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.468 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It usually happens.

00:50:14.468 --> 00:50:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I can't agree with--

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.736 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just
bringing it up.

00:50:17.736 --> 00:50:19.090 align:middle line:90%
This is what this one guy said.

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:21.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the only thing
he could find, as a man,

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:22.906 align:middle line:84%
that this period may
have served at all

00:50:22.906 --> 00:50:24.030 align:middle line:90%
because of the destruction.

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And in the book, it refers to
god as voyeur and controller,

00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:31.290 align:middle line:90%
master of time and space.

00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is an
extraordinarily patriarchal view

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.100 align:middle line:90%
of what a godhead could be.

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And that justified the
science and the behaviors.

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And it came
from the psyche of a man.

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And that's part
of the expose of this story.

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:54.100 align:middle line:84%
It's just you picked up on
one sentence that literally

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:56.320 align:middle line:90%
changes the human mind.

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.470 align:middle line:84%
When you look at it that
way, and you realize

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:01.685 align:middle line:90%
the ramifications of that line.

00:51:01.685 --> 00:51:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Old Testament,
I'll tell you.

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah.

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:05.767 align:middle line:90%


00:51:05.767 --> 00:51:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, no, let's
not get going on it,

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:09.715 align:middle line:84%
because we've only
got nine minutes left.

00:51:09.715 --> 00:51:10.515 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: OK.

00:51:10.515 --> 00:51:12.570 align:middle line:90%


00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We could get going.

00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:18.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean time, itself, and
predestiny, quantum jumping,

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:19.310 align:middle line:90%
what are the rules?

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean we have a lot more
questions here, that I'm not

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:23.470 align:middle line:90%
going to go into, actually.

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Because each one of them
is a story in itself

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:27.740 align:middle line:90%
and too long to answer.

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I hope that we've gotten
enough of the idea across.

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:32.294 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about timelines.

00:51:32.294 --> 00:51:33.460 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about science.

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:37.030 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
patriarchy, interference,

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:38.680 align:middle line:84%
subjugation of
women, all of that

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:43.130 align:middle line:84%
is in this unique story, this
powerful story of going back

00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:43.930 align:middle line:90%
in time.

00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:46.138 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, when it
came to the actual scenes,

00:51:46.138 --> 00:51:49.970 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't read, because
I'm way too sensitive.

00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:51.171 align:middle line:90%
And I know you are.

00:51:51.171 --> 00:51:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: My mother
couldn't make it through it.

00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:55.130 align:middle line:90%
No, and I couldn't, either.

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:57.588 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we're saying,
it's not for the faint-hearted.

00:51:57.588 --> 00:52:00.450 align:middle line:84%
But there's something to
really examine in this.

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:03.010 align:middle line:84%
This hits the total
depth of the darkness

00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:04.930 align:middle line:84%
of the human character
that is now trying

00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:07.300 align:middle line:90%
to find its way into healing.

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's our job is to
work toward the healing.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And its
ultimate purpose

00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:14.740 align:middle line:84%
is to blow the human
mind wide open,

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:16.235 align:middle line:90%
to expand human consciousness.

00:52:16.235 --> 00:52:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And say this
is not on the table

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:22.220 align:middle line:84%
any longer, not anywhere,
anytime in the world,

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:23.350 align:middle line:90%
any longer.

00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:25.030 align:middle line:90%
You did your job on that, honey.

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Thank you.

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:26.760 align:middle line:90%
And George, too.

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
George, too, both of you.

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: He's a
very enlightened man.

00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:32.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And this was a brave thing
to do, a scary thing to do.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.059 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just say,
that's "In a Flicker."

00:52:39.059 --> 00:52:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And now, what I want to do
is move on to something else

00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:43.720 align:middle line:84%
and just talk about it a
little bit, just introduce it.

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Because you're probably
going to come back.

00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:49.510 align:middle line:84%
When we spoke in our
last conversation,

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:55.330 align:middle line:84%
you said that the incidences of
your own contact and witnessing

00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:57.830 align:middle line:84%
of UFOs, et cetera, was
starting to increase.

00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Now this was happening
with you as a child, which

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:04.180 align:middle line:84%
is, to me, inextricably
intertwined with the events

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.990 align:middle line:90%
in your home as a child.

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Integration
and correlation.

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And so, now, all these
years later, this

00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:15.075 align:middle line:84%
is starting to
pick up, big time.

00:53:15.075 --> 00:53:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, major, major
steam in your life

00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:19.310 align:middle line:90%
are these experiences.

00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:20.530 align:middle line:90%
And I would like you--

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:22.840 align:middle line:84%
we only have a few minutes
left-- to just give us

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:25.330 align:middle line:84%
a little idea of
what's going on,

00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:28.445 align:middle line:84%
where you think it's coming
from, and what it's there for?

00:53:28.445 --> 00:53:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Do you see the
light dancing in my eyes--

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:33.165 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: --that we're even
talking about this right now?

00:53:33.165 --> 00:53:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I love,
love what I do.

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't work at all.

00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:42.250 align:middle line:90%
Because I love what I do.

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And what I do predominantly
is in the realm of UFOlogy,

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:52.300 align:middle line:84%
is in the realm of research,
but predominantly experience.

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.160 align:middle line:90%
For the last five years--

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.960 align:middle line:84%
I've had many experiences
over the course of my life,

00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.830 align:middle line:84%
too many to count,
too many to chronicle,

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:01.990 align:middle line:90%
since I was 13 years old.

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And I kept it, generally,
pretty quiet and to myself.

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Even my family was reticent
about me talking about it,

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:16.030 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted to
keep me compartmentalized

00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:17.620 align:middle line:90%
with ghosts and spirits.

00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:20.134 align:middle line:84%
They thought I would be taken
more seriously if I stayed--

00:54:20.134 --> 00:54:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you didn't
open the other can of worms.

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Exactly.

00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
but, my darlings,

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.800 align:middle line:90%
everything is one thing.

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:30.160 align:middle line:90%
And existence is energy is life.

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And everything correlates
with everything else.

00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And these experiences
were actually

00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:37.450 align:middle line:90%
the most profound of my life.

00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And it would be doing a
disservice to humanity,

00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:44.550 align:middle line:84%
now that I have a forum, not to
share what I have been through.

00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want, for
a moment, to anybody

00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:50.110 align:middle line:84%
think that phrasing it
that way meant that it

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:51.940 align:middle line:90%
was any kind of an ordeal.

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:54.880 align:middle line:90%
Because I higher-love them.

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.170 align:middle line:90%
I adore them.

00:54:56.170 --> 00:54:59.410 align:middle line:84%
The galactic family is
all around this planet.

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:01.510 align:middle line:84%
They have been
here for millennia.

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:02.980 align:middle line:90%
They love us.

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And my job, on this
planet, is not only

00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:11.260 align:middle line:84%
to dispel fear about the
other multi-dimensional realms

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:14.050 align:middle line:84%
in which we co-exist
simultaneously,

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:17.380 align:middle line:84%
but also to dispel
the fear about those

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:22.270 align:middle line:84%
who have come, on our behalf, to
make sure that we don't destroy

00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:23.570 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And I've written,
recently, a thesis

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:30.440 align:middle line:84%
that I published
for free, basically,

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:31.760 align:middle line:90%
the chicken and the egg.

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And one night, I was
getting a tap-tap-tap

00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:36.750 align:middle line:90%
on my metaphorical door.

00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Get up.

00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Get up.

00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:39.760 align:middle line:90%
And I went outside.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.650 align:middle line:84%
It was about 2:00, 3
o'clock in the morning.

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:44.290 align:middle line:90%
And I just said, what?

00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:45.090 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:45.890 align:middle line:90%
What do you want?

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:47.660 align:middle line:90%
You woke me up.

00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I just
had a flash of an incident,

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:58.850 align:middle line:84%
where my mother was showing
us, her children, that we could

00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:02.180 align:middle line:84%
quietly observe the
baby chicks pecking

00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:04.340 align:middle line:84%
their way through
the egg, but made

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:07.640 align:middle line:84%
sure to tell us that we
were not to touch the eggs.

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Because if we did,
the chicks would die.

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I went back
into the house,

00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and I wrote my thesis
about why I now

00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:22.130 align:middle line:84%
understand that they are
not intervening actively

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:27.620 align:middle line:84%
on our behalf, because we,
humanity, are in an enclosed

00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:31.400 align:middle line:84%
environment, that we perceive
to be a three dimensional, five

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.960 align:middle line:90%
sensory realm.

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And we are slowly but
surely pecking our way out

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:37.910 align:middle line:90%
of that egg.

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And they can't interfere
with that process,

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:42.470 align:middle line:90%
or we won't survive it.

00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And the exact amount of
energy that it requires

00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.280 align:middle line:84%
for the chicken to peck
its way out of the egg

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:52.670 align:middle line:84%
is equivalent to
the amount of energy

00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:57.110 align:middle line:84%
that they build to sustain
their lives beyond it.

00:56:57.110 --> 00:57:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How beautifully
stated is that?

00:57:00.590 --> 00:57:01.970 align:middle line:90%
My god.

00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:06.080 align:middle line:84%
So the beings and the type
of contact you have clearly

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.410 align:middle line:90%
is very loving and friendly.

00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And very encouraging.

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Oh, much.

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're
having a lot of it.

00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And I assume,
you're being exposed

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.920 align:middle line:90%
to a lot of different messages.

00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:18.260 align:middle line:90%
From multiple races.

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From multiple races.

00:57:21.050 --> 00:57:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Do they ever comment
on the forces

00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:29.380 align:middle line:84%
that do exploit and attempt
to control on this planet?

00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.474 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: They don't judge
in the way that we do.

00:57:31.474 --> 00:57:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:34.940 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRON: If everything
is one thing,

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:38.250 align:middle line:10%
then the darkness
is what illuminates,

00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:39.669 align:middle line:10%
that gives the opportunity--

00:57:39.669 --> 00:57:41.210 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The contrast
for the light.

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:43.100 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRON: --for the light.

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:45.560 align:middle line:10%
And they don't judge
in the way that we do.

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I know that.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: They observe
more than anything.

00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And they understand that we are
an incredibly self-destructive

00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:57.570 align:middle line:84%
race, that we rising
out of that now.

00:57:57.570 --> 00:57:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And that there are
those, on the planet,

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:03.860 align:middle line:84%
among us, yourself, myself,
and myriad other people,

00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:06.170 align:middle line:84%
who are saying the
same thing that's

00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:08.960 align:middle line:84%
been said for
millennia by teachers

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.600 align:middle line:90%
that have come and gone.

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:14.510 align:middle line:84%
But people are listening
in a different way now.

00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:19.200 align:middle line:84%
The message is resonating in
ways that it hasn't before.

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And one of my theories, and
the things that I work on most,

00:58:23.330 --> 00:58:27.430 align:middle line:84%
is my absolute knowledge
that thoughts are things.

00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And that we can literally
heal this planet

00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and ourselves with our
own thought process.

00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Everything comes from
within and so without.

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And I truly believe that
there is a creative source,

00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:41.570 align:middle line:90%
that there is a prime creator.

00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, a number
of the different races

00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:48.290 align:middle line:84%
that routinely visit this planet
believe the same thing, where

00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:50.270 align:middle line:90%
many are humanoid.

00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:54.950 align:middle line:84%
So they have grappled with the
same questions of existence

00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:56.300 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And they're called
the light beings

00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:02.090 align:middle line:90%
in the spiritual community.

00:59:02.090 --> 00:59:04.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole new
vernacular for this.

00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:08.060 align:middle line:84%
I tend not to label anything,
because, if everything

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:10.460 align:middle line:84%
is one thing, then,
really, what we're doing

00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:17.870 align:middle line:84%
is we're exploring the
incredible equation

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:19.070 align:middle line:90%
of existence.

00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I personally believe
that everything

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:23.350 align:middle line:90%
that we perceive to be magical--

00:59:23.350 --> 00:59:24.320 align:middle line:90%
and I love that word.

00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:25.590 align:middle line:90%
I use it all the time--

00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:28.760 align:middle line:84%
but it's just science
we don't understand yet.

00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:30.892 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:59:30.892 --> 00:59:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: My research is
basically experiential.

00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:35.040 align:middle line:90%
I invite it.

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:35.840 align:middle line:90%
I go out.

00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:37.460 align:middle line:90%
I sing to them.

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:39.030 align:middle line:90%
It's all consciousness-based.

00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:39.830 align:middle line:90%
And I sing to them.

00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:41.750 align:middle line:90%
And I talk to them aloud.

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:44.420 align:middle line:84%
My father has had
many experiences.

00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:46.520 align:middle line:90%
Everyone in my family has.

00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:47.880 align:middle line:90%
Some won't talk about it.

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:49.520 align:middle line:90%
My father is very open about it.

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.920 align:middle line:90%
My mother is very open about it.

00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:54.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was visiting
her a few weeks ago.

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And I said, mom, oh, there's
a great vessel out here.

00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:58.190 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.990 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:59:58.990 --> 01:00:01.268 align:middle line:84%
She's like, oh,
honey, you go ahead.

01:00:01.268 --> 01:00:02.216 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Been there.

01:00:02.216 --> 01:00:04.361 align:middle line:90%
I'm finishing making a cake.

01:00:04.361 --> 01:00:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Let me finish my
coffee, then I'll come out.

01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:07.776 align:middle line:90%
If they're still there, yay.

01:00:07.776 --> 01:00:10.370 align:middle line:90%


01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I guess we're paranormal
in that respect.

01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:17.530 align:middle line:90%
But a lot of people are.

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:20.090 align:middle line:84%
There are those that
see multi-dimensionally,

01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:21.920 align:middle line:84%
extra-dimensionally,
on the planet.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.270 align:middle line:84%
I think we're
most-likely hybrid DNA,

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:27.940 align:middle line:84%
blue-eyed, green-eyed
people, Rh negative.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.070 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
science is coming around

01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:31.810 align:middle line:90%
to validate some of that.

01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:34.180 align:middle line:84%
But really, my job
on the planet is

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:36.580 align:middle line:84%
to raise the vibration
of the planet,

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:38.980 align:middle line:84%
to heighten the
frequency, to bring people

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:41.590 align:middle line:84%
into the notion and
the understanding

01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:45.490 align:middle line:84%
that there is a logical
way that we can literally

01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:48.280 align:middle line:84%
change the world through
our own thought process.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's very specific.

01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And when we are bombarded
with negative energy

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.865 align:middle line:84%
and negative stimuli, clear
that out of your mind.

01:00:55.865 --> 01:00:56.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No kidding.

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: You can
have the choice.

01:00:58.210 --> 01:01:00.700 align:middle line:84%
You make the choice
every moment of your life

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.680 align:middle line:84%
how you are going
to live your life.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you clear
that, and you create

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:08.110 align:middle line:84%
a void and a vacancy in your
consciousness, you must,

01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:11.650 align:middle line:84%
absolutely must,
immediately fill that void

01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:16.300 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it was that was
negative, that you expelled,

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:20.350 align:middle line:84%
will slowly and insidiously
refill that void.

01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:22.247 align:middle line:84%
You have to fill
the void, yourself.

01:01:22.247 --> 01:01:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: By choice.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:23.755 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: By choice.

01:01:23.755 --> 01:01:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And that's
why I say, I have seen

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:27.910 align:middle line:90%
the dark side of existence.

01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:31.810 align:middle line:84%
I deliberately choose
to live in the light.

01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On that, OK.

01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Next time, we're going to
talk about the beings you're

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.810 align:middle line:90%
experiencing and the messages.

01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:39.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Andrea.

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:41.050 align:middle line:84%
I know this was a difficult
book for both of us

01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and for probably
the same reasons.

01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:47.527 align:middle line:84%
But it does point out the things
that need healing, very much.

01:01:47.527 --> 01:01:48.610 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Andrea.

01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:48.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Thank you.

>>REGINA: Until next time.

01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Until next time.

01:01:51.070 --> 01:01:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, the name of
the book is "In a Flicker,"

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.840 align:middle line:84%
which can be found
in major booksellers.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.360 align:middle line:10%
