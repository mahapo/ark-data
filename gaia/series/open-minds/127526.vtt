00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In my last
conversation with Jerry Wills,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.110 align:middle line:10%
we explored anomalous
treasure that

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.490 align:middle line:10%
was in the American Southwest
and then spirited away

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.212 align:middle line:10%
by the Smithsonian Institute.

00:00:36.212 --> 00:00:38.420 align:middle line:84%
In today's talk, we're going
to look at what appeared

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.550 align:middle line:90%
to have been a time portal.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And we had to abruptly end our
last conversation, because we

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.400 align:middle line:84%
were having so much
fun I wasn't noticing

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.930 align:middle line:90%
we were running out of time.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And we were at a really juicy
point in the conversation.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.640 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
the various beings--

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.750 align:middle line:84%
and this, I think,
plays into the story

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.800 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about
today-- that have been

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.310 align:middle line:90%
discovered by way of artifacts.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.160 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the American Southwest

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.270 align:middle line:84%
is strewn with anomalous
history, giants of all kinds,

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.710 align:middle line:84%
technologies that
shouldn't have existed,

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:84%
pearls around someone--
thousands of pearls strewn

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.140 align:middle line:84%
around a woman who is tens of
thousands of years old perhaps.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, none of this makes any
sense from our history books,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.680 align:middle line:90%
certainly.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:84%
But then it got us to
the very last subject

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.540 align:middle line:84%
we were on, which is
the notion of ETs,

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and that various of the
Native American cultures

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:84%
really had a very active
relationship with their star

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
brothers, and believed
they were their ancestors.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:84%
That took us to the
ones living underground,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and all these things that
have been found underground.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Then the final question was, is
it possible that the ETs might

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.220 align:middle line:84%
be our true Native
Americans, in that sense,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.260 align:middle line:84%
if they've been living
underground here as

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:90%
long as humanity has?

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And you started
to say something,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.529 align:middle line:84%
and I cut you off because
we ran out of time.

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:10%
>>JERRY WILLS: Well,
what I was going

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.630 align:middle line:10%
to say is that how we
examine who the ETs are

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.820 align:middle line:10%
might need to be really
closely thought about,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:10%
carefully thought about,
because you're right.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.800 align:middle line:84%
What if the Native Americans
are in some respect,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:84%
some aspect, the ETs--
and I know for some people

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.680 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be a
bit of a stretch.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.170 align:middle line:84%
But when you take a look
at what some of the legends

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:41.110 align:middle line:84%
are about the brothers from the
stars, the people who assisted

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.630 align:middle line:84%
and did things, we've come
across quite a few very strange

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:90%
stories.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah, and even
to Quetzalcoatl, and yeah,

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
the notion of being oriented
toward Sirius and Orion

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.750 align:middle line:84%
from indigenous peoples--
cave drawings, ancient.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, one of the things
that I ran across many years

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.440 align:middle line:84%
ago before I ever got involved
in doing any serious research

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.860 align:middle line:84%
with this was up in the
Four Corners region.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.050 align:middle line:90%
There's a place called Shiprock.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's just this feature.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.950 align:middle line:84%
It's in the middle of an
otherwise barren plain.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.790 align:middle line:84%
But it looks in the distance
like a large, several-masted

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.700 align:middle line:90%
sailing ship just sitting there.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a very huge feature.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.770 align:middle line:90%
It is just gigantic.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
You can see it from
many miles away.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:84%
The closer you get,
the more you notice.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.690 align:middle line:84%
It's actually what
I'm pretty sure is

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:84%
a volcanic crater of some
sort, like the spout part.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, I wanted to find
out more about it.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.910 align:middle line:90%
So I started making inquiries.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And what I was told is that
out it's hollow on the inside,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:84%
clear to the sky, and that there
is a passageway from outside

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.310 align:middle line:90%
to inside.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:84%
The Zunis know about
this, and that's

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.196 align:middle line:84%
part of their religious
understanding, their mythology,

00:04:04.196 --> 00:04:08.910 align:middle line:84%
if we can call it that, that
the people from the stars

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.020 align:middle line:90%
brought them to that place.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And before they allowed them
to go out onto the land,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.310 align:middle line:84%
they went out onto the land
and prepared it for them.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is anyone's guess.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.450 align:middle line:84%
But when it was
time, then they were

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:84%
allowed to exit this feature
and go out and start the Zuni

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.380 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.160 align:middle line:90%
You also have the Hopi.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.620 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the last
world, the third world,

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.200 align:middle line:84%
they went underground
and they were taken

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.270 align:middle line:90%
care of by the Ant People.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And then
when it was safe,

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.260 align:middle line:84%
the ant people opened it up
and they came back outside,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.460 align:middle line:84%
and then they started
their culture.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And you have varying
degrees of similar stories,

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.020 align:middle line:84%
not just in the Southwest
but all around the world.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And we've tried to
understand beyond the metaphor

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.400 align:middle line:90%
what this really is saying.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's easy to come
up with some conjectures.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at the Whitley
Strieber ET presence.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Then you could say,
eh, that kind of looks

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.070 align:middle line:90%
like an Ant Person.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.830 align:middle line:84%
But when you take
a look at the Zunis

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.246 align:middle line:84%
and who they say brought them
down, they were like people.

00:05:37.246 --> 00:05:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you take a
look at, who was it,

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:84%
the folks up in Montanas, they
talk about these godlike beings

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:90%
that help them.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.490 align:middle line:84%
So it isn't any one
particular type of being.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.110 align:middle line:90%
It seems to be many.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's no-- when
you first said maybe

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.450 align:middle line:84%
we need to look at the
definition of this term

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.370 align:middle line:84%
"ET," if these are beings
that have been here all along,

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.580 align:middle line:84%
you can't exactly say
they're extraterrestrial.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.460 align:middle line:84%
They might be subterranean, but
they are part of this terrain

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.270 align:middle line:90%
just as we are.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And as we stumble
across these remains

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and what we're
calling anomalies,

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.610 align:middle line:84%
pretty soon-- there are
so many stories now,

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.590 align:middle line:84%
we can't really call
them anomalies anymore.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to say we
simply need to take a deeper

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.300 align:middle line:84%
look into our true history,
which is what we're attempting

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:84%
to do in this whole
suite of shows

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.140 align:middle line:90%
that we're doing here on this.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, and that's what
we try to do at Xpeditions TV,

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.620 align:middle line:84%
is take a look at what has
been obscured or otherwise just

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:84%
outright hidden away and
develop a new understanding

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.050 align:middle line:90%
of where we came from, perhaps.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because it seems
that the elite-- whether you

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.110 align:middle line:84%
call them bloodlines, or whether
you call them brotherhoods

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.680 align:middle line:84%
or whatnot-- of this
planet throughout history

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.540 align:middle line:84%
have tended to sequester
that information.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.530 align:middle line:90%
I said this before.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.250 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily mean
it's all for evil purpose.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they genuinely
thought, people

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.420 align:middle line:84%
aren't quite
sophisticated enough

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.420 align:middle line:84%
to embrace that there might
be another culture living

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.220 align:middle line:90%
under their feet.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.550 align:middle line:84%
It could be something as
simple as not giving people

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.660 align:middle line:84%
credit for having the
intelligence they have.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.820 align:middle line:84%
It could be something
as simple as making

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:84%
sure to exploit the
situation completely

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.920 align:middle line:84%
for whatever may
be gained from it

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.390 align:middle line:84%
before anyone else
has access to it.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.370 align:middle line:84%
There are probably many
motives for keeping

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.360 align:middle line:90%
this information hidden.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: One of the things that
Kathy came up with that I found

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:48.330 align:middle line:84%
extraordinary were the tenets
of what modern archeology is all

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.181 align:middle line:84%
about, how it was
originally put into place--

00:07:51.181 --> 00:07:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Share with us.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And that was done
with, as I recall, John Wesley

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Powell, who was putting
these pieces in place

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.770 align:middle line:90%
for what archeology would be.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.184 align:middle line:84%
And it also had to do with
the Smithsonian Institute.

00:08:05.184 --> 00:08:07.530 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHING]

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:13.790 align:middle line:84%
As I recall, it would
not be a history

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:22.440 align:middle line:84%
that would navigate into any
arena that would subjugate

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:90%
what was written in the Bible.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.190 align:middle line:90%
That would be true.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:34.429 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And if it did, then it
would be destroyed or ignored.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:38.789 align:middle line:84%
And if it was destroyed, of
course it would be ignored.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that has
happened time and time again so

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:50.780 align:middle line:84%
far as we've felt why it
would be important for history

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:57.100 align:middle line:84%
to be reflected
against the Bible.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.698 align:middle line:84%
It's understandable
why somebody might

00:09:00.698 --> 00:09:01.906 align:middle line:90%
be in the mindset to do that.

00:09:01.906 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle line:84%
You have people
today that want to--

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.260 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, still think
humanity is 6,000 years old.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a point at which you
have to say, come on now.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Can we just open
it up a little bit?

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, there are
all kinds of folks out there

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.310 align:middle line:84%
that are wanting their
view of the world

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:24.750 align:middle line:84%
to be the view of the world
that's salient and accepted.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:31.060 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to
things like the giants--

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Ant People.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: The Ant People.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:39.270 align:middle line:84%
These stories that are from
the Native American cultures--

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:43.430 align:middle line:84%
which, incidentally, many of
these stories are lost to time.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.120 align:middle line:90%
Only a few of them remain.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was even a felony
to keep the stories alive.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:84%
They kept it alive
through their dances.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:90%
And if they did a dance, well--

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some of the
artwork-- cave drawings.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: There's a Native
American group in Nebraska,

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.290 align:middle line:84%
where Kathy is
from, and they have

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.600 align:middle line:84%
a piece of parchment--
it's leather actually,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.800 align:middle line:84%
not parchment-- that has
all these drawings on it

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:84%
about the different stars and
where people come and so forth.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And every so often, when
it gets old and tattered,

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.710 align:middle line:84%
they make a new one, and
they draw it and so forth.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of
their historical culture.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.306 align:middle line:84%
Well, you take a look
back 100 years ago,

00:10:29.306 --> 00:10:30.180 align:middle line:90%
that was foolishness.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.320 align:middle line:90%
It's against the Bible.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.970 align:middle line:90%
Burn it.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
things were destroyed.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So it's an
unfortunate thing.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:43.780 align:middle line:84%
But why is it, in
our modern time,

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.860 align:middle line:84%
there are pieces that are
absolute evidence that

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.930 align:middle line:84%
would lead us in a different
direction of thinking,

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.800 align:middle line:84%
that these pieces would be
absconded with and hidden away

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.600 align:middle line:90%
from view?

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And I know we're going to
talk about the portals,

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:04.200 align:middle line:84%
but in this particular arena,
we found something-- Kathy found

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.870 align:middle line:84%
something-- that is so
absolutely extraordinary,

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:90%
and it's completely ignored.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.300 align:middle line:84%
The evidence is completely
destroyed, gone.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's done so to keep
any inquiry from being

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.890 align:middle line:90%
made in this direction.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, is this something
we haven't talked about before?

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I
don't think we have.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.740 align:middle line:84%
We did do a press release
on this a couple of years

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.970 align:middle line:90%
ago, largely ignored.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:32.350 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:36.919 align:middle line:84%
What she discovered--
well, first of all--

00:11:36.919 --> 00:11:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
not the thing we're

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.835 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about at
the end of the show.

00:11:39.835 --> 00:11:41.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a whole other thing?

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.691 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: This is a
whole other thing.

00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Surprise me.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, you see, on
top of a mountain in Bolivia,

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.470 align:middle line:84%
a few years ago when
we were in Bolivia,

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:54.800 align:middle line:84%
it was reported that there
was a human footprint found

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:90%
in sandstone.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:01.950 align:middle line:84%
This was, now, we're looking
at seven, eight years ago.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:06.890 align:middle line:84%
For five years,
Kathy did research

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.280 align:middle line:84%
to try and figure out
the details on this.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.270 align:middle line:84%
We found out who
the archaeologist

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:15.470 align:middle line:90%
was working at Smithsonian.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.620 align:middle line:84%
We found out very
little, just that it

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.430 align:middle line:84%
was something that
was found, and we

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.460 align:middle line:84%
were led off in a
direction completely away

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.940 align:middle line:84%
from where it
actually was located.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.440 align:middle line:90%
And that was done intentionally.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.523 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: They didn't
know who we were,

00:12:29.523 --> 00:12:32.470 align:middle line:84%
and I understand
why they did it.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:84%
After five years, she
discovered this information.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.470 align:middle line:84%
I had to have
languages translated

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and thank
god for Google Translate,

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.500 align:middle line:90%
because it helped her.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.740 align:middle line:84%
We were hiding away
from some terrorists

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:53.320 align:middle line:84%
in the jungles of
Peru, and she's

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.890 align:middle line:84%
back at her computer in
the middle of the jungle

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.290 align:middle line:84%
with a satellite uplink
typing in, trying

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.690 align:middle line:90%
to track down what was this.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:06.570 align:middle line:84%
It was a human
footprint in sandstone.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:07.780 align:middle line:90%
She found it.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.610 align:middle line:84%
It was on top of a
mountain, of all places.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And she found all the
details we needed.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.472 align:middle line:84%
We immediately booked
a flight and went.

00:13:15.472 --> 00:13:18.530 align:middle line:84%
When we got there, the
footprint had been sawed out

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:22.420 align:middle line:90%
of the stratum of sandstone.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle line:84%
We climbed this 17,000-foot
mountain hand over fist to get

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.960 align:middle line:90%
there to document it.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.760 align:middle line:90%
It was gone.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.870 align:middle line:90%
We were disappointed.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.852 align:middle line:84%
It was a hell of a
journey, very difficult.

00:13:34.852 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And she says, if there was
one, there's got to be others.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, she found two
more that no one knew existed.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Having scampered around the
peaky point of a mountain,

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.040 align:middle line:84%
climbing in crevices and
hanging on for her life,

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:90%
she found two more footprints.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.560 align:middle line:84%
One of them was very
clearly a footprint.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.595 align:middle line:84%
The other was pretty
rough, eroded.

00:13:55.595 --> 00:13:58.420 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.570 align:middle line:84%
So the point here
of all this isn't

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.760 align:middle line:84%
that she found
something remarkable,

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.270 align:middle line:84%
but that when this evidence
is brought forward,

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:90%
it's completely ignored.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And we've
run across this kind

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.290 align:middle line:84%
of circumstance with others
who have found things

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:19.640 align:middle line:84%
as well, others who have found
equally remarkable things.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, keep in mind, this
stratum of sandstone

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:28.460 align:middle line:84%
is somewhere between three
million and 12 million years

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.640 align:middle line:90%
old.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's a human footprint
with a very characteristic

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.160 align:middle line:90%
human foot impression.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
that even happen?

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Under the most
unusual of circumstances.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.640 align:middle line:84%
The only way it
could happen is--

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The sandstone
had to be liquid.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.815 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It was.

00:14:47.815 --> 00:14:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And at one time, at 17,000
feet, it was once a marsh.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.590 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
millions of years ago.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.150 align:middle line:84%
No one really knows how
old this was, except

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:84%
that it was at
least three million.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That it could
have even withstood

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.450 align:middle line:84%
all of the movement of wind and
such of the time is amazing.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.992 align:middle line:84%
And it's just in our age
that it became available.

00:15:10.992 --> 00:15:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this has
come up in conversations

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.494 align:middle line:90%
with Michael Cremo as well.

00:15:15.494 --> 00:15:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: We got ahold of
Michael Cremo and told him.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And Cremo was
actually quite interested

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:27.370 align:middle line:84%
in helping us to figure
out where it was at,

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:28.950 align:middle line:84%
but he didn't even
have access to it.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.470 align:middle line:90%
He reported on this.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:34.047 align:middle line:84%
This is part of our
conception of research.

00:15:34.047 --> 00:15:36.750 align:middle line:90%


00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
changes, certainly,

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.760 align:middle line:84%
the time frame of human history,
if you're going about three

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.650 align:middle line:90%
to 12 million.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:46.655 align:middle line:84%
But if you start going into
more esoteric science circles--

00:15:46.655 --> 00:15:50.470 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mean just esoterica,
but esoteric science circles--

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.655 align:middle line:84%
humanity is very,
very, very ancient.

00:15:52.655 --> 00:15:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It's very ancient.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Beyond what we
can comprehend at this time.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.390 align:middle line:84%
We've gone through
various iterations.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: There are many.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
many, but I know there

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.740 align:middle line:90%
are quite a number of them.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.370 align:middle line:84%
In a dig at Tiwanaku,
we were there

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:84%
with researchers,
archaeologists who were digging.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:16.400 align:middle line:84%
They went down, oh gosh,
it must have been 35,

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.280 align:middle line:84%
40 feet in this one
particular area.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And Tiwanaku is a place-- when
we first started going there,

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.600 align:middle line:90%
it was completely uncontrolled.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.230 align:middle line:84%
No one was paying
much attention to it.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.510 align:middle line:84%
It was an unusual
place-- barely anything

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:31.530 align:middle line:84%
to be seen, and so difficult
to get to at the time

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:37.110 align:middle line:84%
that it was a real
effort to get to it.

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Going down 30 meters, they
went through various layers

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.920 align:middle line:84%
of civilization
from sophistication

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:90%
down to primitive.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.900 align:middle line:84%
But then at some point,
the last, I don't know,

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:56.550 align:middle line:84%
say 10 feet-- and 10 feet
represents a lot of edge--

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.950 align:middle line:84%
they went from ancient
and unsophisticated back

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:84%
to sophistication
back to something

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.322 align:middle line:84%
even more sophisticated than
what they'd ever found before.

00:17:04.322 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:90%


00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.786 align:middle line:84%
They had to just throw it
all back in and cover it up,

00:17:09.786 --> 00:17:11.327 align:middle line:84%
because that isn't
supposed to exist.

00:17:11.327 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So you have a conceited effort
to keep these things away

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.599 align:middle line:90%
from the mainstream.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:29.030 align:middle line:84%
This footprint that
was sought out is gone.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.850 align:middle line:84%
We tracked it as far as
we could, and it was gone.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:33.800 align:middle line:90%
We have no idea.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:84%
They had a press conference
where they showed it

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.740 align:middle line:90%
in Bolivia, and it was gone.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, this is
just unbridled arrogance

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.590 align:middle line:84%
on the part of those who think
that the world is still such

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.900 align:middle line:84%
as they believe it or their
ancestors believed it to be,

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.070 align:middle line:90%
that people are that ignorant.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.140 align:middle line:84%
They can't put pieces
together themselves anymore.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.760 align:middle line:90%
They can't handle truth.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:90%
That is so arrogant.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:84%
It's almost beyond
comprehension that anyone

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:84%
would stop the flow of
knowledge at this point

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.970 align:middle line:90%
in our human history.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: If we knew the
reality of our past,

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.330 align:middle line:84%
we might have a
different future.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.060 align:middle line:90%
I believe the same thing.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.244 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Because we're
not who we think we are.

00:18:19.244 --> 00:18:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And that takes us all the
way back to the other side

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:23.600 align:middle line:84%
of the world where we
were at just a moment ago

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.430 align:middle line:84%
with the Native
Americans and their claim

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:28.870 align:middle line:90%
that they come from the stars.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:33.500 align:middle line:84%
The people in South America,
the Native Americans there too,

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.560 align:middle line:84%
also say that they
came from the stars.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The aboriginals
in Africa, as well.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, sorry, Australia.

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:40.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Africa-- the Dogons, in
connection to Sirius as well.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes, on and on.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So you have this
belief by these folks.

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a belief at this
point, because they

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.380 align:middle line:84%
don't have any solid
evidence to say,

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:84%
yeah, we can say this is
such and this is such,

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:59.290 align:middle line:90%
so now we know this.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:01.373 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we buried
the spaceship over here.

00:19:01.373 --> 00:19:02.173 align:middle line:90%


00:19:02.173 --> 00:19:04.499 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But as far as they're
concerned, they know it.

00:19:04.499 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:90%
For us, it's just their belief.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And again, this is
very, very ancient history

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.930 align:middle line:84%
that has been passed down
from their ancestors.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.910 align:middle line:90%
So who were these people?

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:16.590 align:middle line:90%
Were they really from the stars?

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm beginning to
wonder if they were.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the question.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's come up in
several of my last interviews.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.220 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.552 align:middle line:84%
Or are they from here,
just like we are?

00:19:26.552 --> 00:19:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Or is there something
even larger than that?

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interdimensional.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Possibly.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:39.500 align:middle line:84%
See, what we're sort of finding
is that human life did not

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.520 align:middle line:90%
originate on this world.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It came
here from the stars.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.570 align:middle line:90%
But when?

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:49.540 align:middle line:90%
And what happened?

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take it at that
point for just a second.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.940 align:middle line:84%
If it didn't originate
here, it automatically

00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:01.830 align:middle line:84%
insinuates that they had the
ability to go other places.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case, then
the people who were left here,

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.100 align:middle line:84%
well, they became
citizens of this world.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.330 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And there were others
who weren't, who

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.255 align:middle line:90%
came back and forth.

00:20:16.255 --> 00:20:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And now they are.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Exactly.

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, as I
view it, there really

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.740 align:middle line:90%
are no truly indigenous humans.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.972 align:middle line:84%
We all have a bit
of some other seed.

00:20:28.972 --> 00:20:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And then there's
all kinds of different ways

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.510 align:middle line:84%
this can play out as far as,
oh, well, maybe they were

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:90%
created to be the workforce.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.597 align:middle line:84%
We've heard of that
with the Anunnaki.

00:20:38.597 --> 00:20:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's just
a tiny pixel of history.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.410 align:middle line:90%
That is not human history.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:43.810 align:middle line:90%
And I've argued that point.

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I'm not so
sure the Anunnaki is

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:49.360 align:middle line:84%
a proper word for who these
people are, because when you

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.250 align:middle line:84%
take a look way back
into the past-- something

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.100 align:middle line:84%
we'll get into a
little bit-- then

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.420 align:middle line:84%
you start realizing
that, wait a minute,

00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.950 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about people
using terms that are completely

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:05.170 align:middle line:84%
incorrect, because there's
historical evidence that

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.590 align:middle line:84%
absolutely shows that
it's not correct to use

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:90%
that term for those people.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.520 align:middle line:84%
It's something else, and
we don't know what it is.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we're in the
Wild West of this rediscovery.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.020 align:middle line:84%
There's no one laying down any
bread crumbs for us, per se.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, there have been actually,
in some cases, the Egyptians.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.890 align:middle line:84%
But by and large, we're
having to figure it all out.

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And some people get
all excited about this

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.540 align:middle line:84%
and are attached to
that story, and vice--

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.140 align:middle line:90%
and it's this over here.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.110 align:middle line:84%
So you're right, I
think things have

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:37.420 align:middle line:84%
been kind of misappropriated
in terms of terms, titles,

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.370 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So that brings us
to the Native Americans,

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:45.980 align:middle line:84%
and them progressing through
time, having survived god

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.620 align:middle line:84%
only knows what kind
of circumstances

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.020 align:middle line:84%
that this planet has
faced in the past.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.052 align:middle line:84%
We have kind of
an inkling of it.

00:21:54.052 --> 00:21:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: An
underground species were

00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:02.040 align:middle line:84%
the ones that would have
tended to survive the surface

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.510 align:middle line:90%
cataclysms, too.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, they would have
had to have gone underground

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:05.620 align:middle line:90%
to survive.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:06.836 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:22:06.836 --> 00:22:10.620 align:middle line:84%
So there are lineages
that have existed

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.290 align:middle line:90%
throughout these cataclysms.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And I'll go into
that in just a few minutes.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.920 align:middle line:84%
It will surprise you,
because it surprised us.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:84%
The thing that I find
fascinating about this

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.640 align:middle line:84%
is that all of
these cultures refer

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:31.110 align:middle line:84%
to very unusual and
strange circumstances

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:34.260 align:middle line:84%
surrounding different places
and different features

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.250 align:middle line:90%
on the landscape.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Some places are-- what
would you call it?

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.310 align:middle line:90%
Holy places, sacred places.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.170 align:middle line:90%
Why is this a sacred place?

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't that over
there a sacred place?

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.160 align:middle line:84%
We're only now starting
to ask that question,

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and really wanting
to know the answer.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's wrapped up
in the mythology of the people

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.350 align:middle line:90%
who are telling us about it.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:22:59.340 align:middle line:90%
Folks go to Sedona.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.506 align:middle line:90%
There's a vortex over there.

00:23:00.506 --> 00:23:01.631 align:middle line:90%
There's a vortex over here.

00:23:01.631 --> 00:23:03.964 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Native Americans
think, oh, those white people

00:23:03.964 --> 00:23:04.850 align:middle line:90%
are crazy.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.590 align:middle line:84%
No Native American
would have ever lived

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.210 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of those vortexes.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And I live smack-dab in
the middle of all of them.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And right outside of
Sedona, you have a place

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:18.330 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of strange
things have happened,

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:23.360 align:middle line:84%
where people have disappeared
into the middle of nothing,

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.800 align:middle line:84%
and houses have appeared
and gone away again,

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.990 align:middle line:84%
like you're looking
back into the past.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.390 align:middle line:84%
There are places like that
in South America, too.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the Indian former
home of the Apache and Yavapai

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:44.760 align:middle line:84%
at Palatki and you just
soft focus your vision,

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.470 align:middle line:84%
you see some of the previous
inhabitants walking the land

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:49.270 align:middle line:90%
still.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:50.811 align:middle line:84%
I've seen all kinds
of strange things

00:23:50.811 --> 00:23:55.020 align:middle line:84%
out there-- births of babies
happening, all kinds of things.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:55.930 align:middle line:90%
Still very present.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And these aren't
imaginary or hallucinatory

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:01.072 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:24:01.072 --> 00:24:03.030 align:middle line:84%
I know, because I've seen
things like this too.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And I had to question
my own sanity

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:08.250 align:middle line:90%
when I would see these things.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:14.202 align:middle line:84%
Even UFOs-- whatever UFO
really means or what it is,

00:24:14.202 --> 00:24:17.130 align:middle line:84%
it's an unidentified
thing flying around.

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:18.930 align:middle line:90%
That's a classic term.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:21.110 align:middle line:84%
But lights moving
through the sky,

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:23.620 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, poof, they're
gone, or suddenly poof,

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.120 align:middle line:90%
they're on the ground.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.720 align:middle line:90%
And they move up a little bit.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.520 align:middle line:90%
Poof, they're gone.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.740 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
see that in Sedona.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But back to
the Native Americans,

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Geronimo was said to
show up way over there,

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and the next thing you know,
he's over here, way over here.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And how did he
get there so fast?

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.370 align:middle line:84%
They thought that he
had some kind of magic.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:51.110 align:middle line:90%


00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, science that
isn't understood

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:01.140 align:middle line:90%
is indistinguishable from magic.

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Doing something that can't
be explained is magical.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.712 align:middle line:84%
How did he go from
point A to point B?

00:25:08.712 --> 00:25:10.462 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think we might
have gotten a clue.

00:25:10.462 --> 00:25:14.000 align:middle line:90%


00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.980 align:middle line:84%
You see, we ran
across this story.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.840 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:23.040 align:middle line:90%
Ron Quinn wrote this story.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I think it was in
"Fate Magazine."

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was quite a tall
tale, but a good one.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes?

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And eventually,
Kathy-- she runs across things.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.310 align:middle line:84%
She's always looking
for these things.

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And she says, you aren't
going to believe this one.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.455 align:middle line:84%
We have to go and
check this out.

00:25:45.455 --> 00:25:48.360 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.050 align:middle line:90%
I read it out loud.

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.030 align:middle line:90%
We're both sitting there.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:58.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm just shaking my head, going
oh my god, this is astonishing.

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:02.750 align:middle line:84%
It took us a couple of
years to find Ron Quinn.

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And when we did,
we found him to be

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:11.060 align:middle line:84%
an amazing character, a
really, really nice man,

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.750 align:middle line:90%
but very secretive.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:16.010 align:middle line:84%
He'd spent most of his
life as a treasure hunter.

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:18.380 align:middle line:90%
He found Spanish gold.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.610 align:middle line:90%
He found Spanish mines.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:23.829 align:middle line:84%
But he also found a lot of
other strange anomalous things,

00:26:23.829 --> 00:26:24.870 align:middle line:90%
things he took pictures--

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:27.565 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Poking around in the
American Southwest, you will.

00:26:27.565 --> 00:26:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: This is a man who
was involved in the film

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:33.100 align:middle line:84%
industry in Hollywood
and walked away

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.670 align:middle line:84%
from it to go hunt for geodes
and lost Spanish treasure

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:37.860 align:middle line:90%
with his brother.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And they went up
into this one region

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.200 align:middle line:84%
looking for minerals
and Spanish treasure,

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.890 align:middle line:84%
supplementing their income
by digging up geodes

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and selling it to the people
who would like to buy a geode

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:51.720 align:middle line:90%
and take it home.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, on a nearby
farm-- and they

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.370 align:middle line:84%
were actually
ranches, not farms--

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:00.980 align:middle line:84%
there were a lot
of different kinds

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.680 align:middle line:84%
of Native Americans
working these places,

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.340 align:middle line:90%
and folks from Mexico.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And one day, Ron Quinn and his
brother passed this fellow,

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.060 align:middle line:84%
a Native American broke down
on the side of the road.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.230 align:middle line:90%
And so they helped him out.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Normally, Native
Americans would have just

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.270 align:middle line:90%
been like, to hell with him.

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.070 align:middle line:90%
Just go on.

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.140 align:middle line:84%
We don't have anything
to do with them.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:23.970 align:middle line:90%
They're just dirt.

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But not for Ron
Quinn and his brother.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.100 align:middle line:84%
They stopped, helped him
out, got him going again,

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.992 align:middle line:90%
and he was grateful.

00:27:31.992 --> 00:27:34.900 align:middle line:84%
A few weeks later
this fellow showed up,

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.730 align:middle line:84%
because they were near
a ranch he worked.

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:90%
He sit down told them a story.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:42.339 align:middle line:84%
It was only a story that was
shared within their tribe,

00:27:42.339 --> 00:27:44.880 align:middle line:84%
because they were really close
to where the story took place.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.960 align:middle line:84%
He says, you know about that
place over there, don't you?

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.970 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:49.710 align:middle line:90%
So he told them the story.

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And the story basically was
that there were some Indians

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:58.010 align:middle line:84%
playing, and they were running
around these rock features.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of them jumped through
this arch, and he vanished.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.011 align:middle line:84%
So they were pretty
shocked about this.

00:28:07.011 --> 00:28:09.260 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't find him,
didn't know what had happened.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.218 align:middle line:90%
They were afraid of it.

00:28:10.218 --> 00:28:12.200 align:middle line:90%
They went back, told the tribe.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.645 align:middle line:90%
The tribe comes.

00:28:13.645 --> 00:28:16.562 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to figure
out what happened to him.

00:28:16.562 --> 00:28:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was a
rabbit or a chicken--

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a rabbit.

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: A rabbit through
there, and it vanished.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a
woman, a grandma,

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:84%
went threw the rabbit
through to see if there

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.520 align:middle line:90%
was any truth in it, right?

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.100 align:middle line:90%
It disappeared.

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It vanished.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.730 align:middle line:84%
So this fellow is
relating this story.

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And he says, there's a place
right over there down this way,

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:41.000 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So Ron Quinn and his brother
had been searching for geodes,

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and they decided to
go check that out.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.380 align:middle line:90%
They did.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.430 align:middle line:90%
And the arch was there.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't want
to do much around it.

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't
try to jump through?

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: No, they
were afraid of it.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.670 align:middle line:84%
But they had some very
strange things happen there.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:07.340 align:middle line:84%
For example, one afternoon
they were sitting there,

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.710 align:middle line:90%
tired of digging for geodes.

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind, this is a plateau
in the middle of nowhere,

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.070 align:middle line:84%
with big mountains all around
and a view to the valley

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.560 align:middle line:90%
floor off in this direction.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.720 align:middle line:84%
It's just sort of
flat and desert.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.070 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:26.670 align:middle line:84%
This plateau is made
entirely of crystal.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a
crystalline plateau.

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:34.376 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is really a
critical piece of the story.

00:29:34.376 --> 00:29:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, it is.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: They look
through the arch,

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:42.380 align:middle line:84%
and what they see on the other
side is that, although it's

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:45.810 align:middle line:84%
cloudy and overcast
where they are, it's not,

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:48.040 align:middle line:84%
the sky is clearer,
and the sun's shining

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.650 align:middle line:90%
the same way over there.

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.000 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any sense.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And in the distance,
they see what

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:56.010 align:middle line:84%
looks like conquistadors
riding by on horses.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And they're sitting there
watching this, fascinated.

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Look around the corner, there
isn't anything like that.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:02.720 align:middle line:90%
It's just the normal view.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.220 align:middle line:84%
They look through the doorway,
and they're seeing this.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Another story-- Ron
Quinn was sitting

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.730 align:middle line:84%
on the side of the mountain
after having exhausted himself

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:13.550 align:middle line:84%
trying to find
geodes and minerals,

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and just sort of closed
his eyes, took a breath,

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:18.690 align:middle line:84%
opened his eyes, and suddenly
realized he didn't really

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:22.200 align:middle line:90%
understand where he was at.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:26.240 align:middle line:84%
He was on now the other
side of the plateau.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.640 align:middle line:84%
He didn't go through the arch,
but he had made his way around

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.440 align:middle line:90%
to the other side.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It just
popped him over there.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Another example of this was
he was there one morning

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and looked up and saw
someone over there

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:48.530 align:middle line:84%
on that hillside with a truck,
with binoculars looking at him.

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So he took his binoculars
and looked back,

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and it looked like
he was looking

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:57.216 align:middle line:84%
at an older version of himself,
which kind of freaked him out.

00:30:57.216 --> 00:30:59.200 align:middle line:84%
He put his binoculars
down, looked back,

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.610 align:middle line:90%
and there's no one there.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Fast forward many years later,
he's now over there in a truck

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:11.440 align:middle line:84%
looking at somebody
sitting on the plateau.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:17.870 align:middle line:84%
This wrinkle in time-- it's
a very, very strange place,

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:19.180 align:middle line:90%
extraordinarily.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And Kathy wants to
go check this out.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So do I. And I figured
we needed to find out

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.530 align:middle line:84%
what the reality is for
Xpeditions TV and all

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:34.370 align:middle line:90%
of our viewers.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So we take off and
do this with a team.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:40.390 align:middle line:84%
When we get out there,
it's now many years

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:42.610 align:middle line:84%
past the point when Ron
Quinn had been there.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:45.260 align:middle line:90%


00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And we want to find
the arch, and we

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:50.270 align:middle line:84%
want to find the
plateau, and so forth.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:53.220 align:middle line:90%
We searched for days.

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.140 align:middle line:84%
We've made several
trips down there.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Could not find this place,
even with Ron Quinn's map.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you know
what had already happened

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:03.372 align:middle line:90%
to the previous arch?

00:32:03.372 --> 00:32:05.080 align:middle line:84%
You weren't aware of
it yet at this time?

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Not at that point.

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.025 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Ron said he thought
the arch had crumbled

00:32:09.025 --> 00:32:11.690 align:middle line:90%
and was gone now.

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:17.370 align:middle line:84%
But he said there should be some
evidence of where it had been.

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.000 align:middle line:10%
So we're looking.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.330 align:middle line:10%
We don't find a plateau.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:24.320 align:middle line:10%
We don't find the
arch, none of it.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Believe me, this is such a
difficult place to move around.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's really remote.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Finally, Kathy and I
climbed up to the top

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:35.910 align:middle line:84%
of one of the
mountains-- nothing

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:39.270 align:middle line:84%
like Peru, where it's
14,000 or 17,000 feet,

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.965 align:middle line:90%
but still, a few thousand feet.

00:32:40.965 --> 00:32:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it was hot.

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:42.923 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It was hot.

00:32:42.923 --> 00:32:45.280 align:middle line:90%
Very dry.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.590 align:middle line:90%
And there it was.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So we made our way down,
walked across the arch,

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:51.420 align:middle line:90%
investigated it.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:52.628 align:middle line:90%
It's getting late in the day.

00:32:52.628 --> 00:32:53.750 align:middle line:90%
We had to leave.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Came back again another time
with a full research team.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And we scoured that area looking
for the arch-- which of course

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:08.430 align:middle line:84%
by now, knowing the map and
where it had been placed,

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:09.560 align:middle line:90%
we knew it was gone.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.276 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to find
some evidence of it,

00:33:11.276 --> 00:33:13.650 align:middle line:84%
or if there was anything really
strange about this place.

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:16.180 align:middle line:90%
It felt very weird.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.577 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And again, the
presence of all this crystal.

00:33:18.577 --> 00:33:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, all this crystal.

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:23.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a very unique feature.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:28.410 align:middle line:84%
What happened during
that time is that we

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:32.220 align:middle line:90%
discovered a second arch.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And that second arch, according
to Ron Quinn, was never there.

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he
knew where you were.

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:43.310 align:middle line:90%
You were in the same spot.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:46.154 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere nearby
was the remains

00:33:46.154 --> 00:33:48.320 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't really
identify of the first arch.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It was just little
nubby things all broken down.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet, a
second arch appears?

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Suddenly, there's a
second arch right over here.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those
don't just appear.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So we're
asking Ron Quinn,

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.167 align:middle line:90%
what do you make of this?

00:34:02.167 --> 00:34:03.500 align:middle line:90%
And he says, well, I don't know.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.860 align:middle line:90%
I lived there for three years.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I was all over every
inch of that landscape.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:13.100 align:middle line:90%
There is not that thing there.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.840 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't there.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:18.489 align:middle line:90%
This is a recent thing.

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:19.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's a big mystery.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.381 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it didn't
look like something

00:34:21.381 --> 00:34:23.610 align:middle line:84%
that could be
constructed by humans

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:27.080 align:middle line:84%
out of the native-- it looks
like an odd but natural arch.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.659 align:middle line:84%
It's just like any other
weathered, sandstone-looking

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:31.719 align:middle line:90%
arch thing.

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:34.330 align:middle line:84%
But he swears up and
down it was never there.

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:37.050 align:middle line:90%
It lends to the mystery.

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:39.639 align:middle line:84%
But what starts
getting very peculiar

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:46.250 align:middle line:84%
is what's happening
for us and for others.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:51.520 align:middle line:84%
For us, we are camped
out on a hill overlooking

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.489 align:middle line:84%
the valley, which you have to
enter to go a long way down

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:56.606 align:middle line:90%
to get to where this is at.

00:34:56.606 --> 00:35:05.560 align:middle line:84%
At night, there came up a
tremendous wind and storm.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:09.320 align:middle line:84%
It was so strong, it
nearly blew over the van.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:13.290 align:middle line:84%
It completely took all the
tents and just flattened them,

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:16.710 align:middle line:84%
sent them sailing
across this landscape.

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:21.754 align:middle line:84%
We were pretty frightened
by it all, so frightened

00:35:21.754 --> 00:35:23.170 align:middle line:84%
we decided we were
going to leave.

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:26.300 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to find out, what
in the world kind of storm

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:27.660 align:middle line:90%
was this?

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:33.590 align:middle line:84%
The wind was coming from the
direction of this plateau.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:37.170 align:middle line:84%
So we got a hold of the Border
Patrol, National Weather

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Service, and both of
them have bases nearby

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.410 align:middle line:90%
and within a couple of miles.

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And they have patrols
out all the time there.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
there was no wind.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.000 align:middle line:90%
There was no wind last night.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.620 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.716 align:middle line:84%
Both the National Weather
Service and the Border Patrol.

00:35:57.716 --> 00:36:02.170 align:middle line:84%
We said, well, it was so strong
it nearly blew over the van.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's a point of
curiosity with this.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:14.220 align:middle line:84%
The other thing are the
lights that were the UFOs.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.310 align:middle line:84%
But they were balls of light
that were floating up and down

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:20.770 align:middle line:90%
this valley.

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:24.460 align:middle line:84%
I've seen UFOs in different
parts of the world,

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:29.346 align:middle line:84%
and this was just very typical
of things that I've seen.

00:36:29.346 --> 00:36:34.770 align:middle line:84%
It was like magnesium
burning they so bright.

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:38.410 align:middle line:84%
But the strangest
thing is that there

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:41.240 align:middle line:84%
was a fellow who must have
either read Ron's report

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.620 align:middle line:90%
or saw our video.

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.910 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to go see for himself.

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:51.250 align:middle line:84%
He's a loner, an explorer,
and part-time treasure hunter,

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:56.120 align:middle line:84%
and he has his rifle and his
sidearm and his super duper

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.410 align:middle line:84%
camping equipment,
and he's ready.

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, and he
goes right out there

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:02.010 align:middle line:90%
to where the plateau is.

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:06.120 align:middle line:84%
He climbs the mountain like
we did, and he finds it.

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.390 align:middle line:90%
And he camps out.

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:11.530 align:middle line:84%
A week later, his
family is wondering

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:12.930 align:middle line:90%
why hasn't he come back.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So they send in
people to go look.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.440 align:middle line:90%


00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:21.690 align:middle line:84%
What they find is his rifle,
his sidearm, his belongings,

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:25.220 align:middle line:90%
his tent, his camp.

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.750 align:middle line:90%
But they don't find him.

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:33.880 align:middle line:84%
He's just gone and has
never been seen since.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And this sounds like quite a
tall tale, but it's the truth.

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:39.680 align:middle line:90%
This guy's missing.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.790 align:middle line:90%
They contacted Ron Quinn.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:43.406 align:middle line:90%
They wanted help with it.

00:37:43.406 --> 00:37:46.860 align:middle line:90%


00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.652 align:middle line:84%
No one knows what
happened to this man.

00:37:48.652 --> 00:37:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
the original arch

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:55.790 align:middle line:84%
that the original native
men, boys, were passing

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:58.330 align:middle line:90%
and one went through was gone.

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:00.530 align:middle line:84%
The one they threw the
chicken through was gone.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, you guys passed
through the little arch.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.780 align:middle line:90%
Nothing anomalous about it?

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I tried using
some of the equipment we

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:08.610 align:middle line:90%
had to test it.

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:10.401 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing really
anomalous about it

00:38:10.401 --> 00:38:12.690 align:middle line:84%
at all, except it just
never existed before.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:15.910 align:middle line:84%
We'd never been there before,
so I can't attest to that.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But something
in that space--

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Something in that
space very strange is going on.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.560 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.530 align:middle line:90%
It's a tangible sensation.

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Some people say, oh, I can
feel the energy of crystals.

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:30.397 align:middle line:84%
When you go walking
around this plateau--

00:38:30.397 --> 00:38:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The whole
thing is crystals.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.521 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: The whole
thing is crystals.

00:38:33.521 --> 00:38:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And whether you can
feel it or not--

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.915 align:middle line:84%
and we had people with
us who are scientists,

00:38:36.915 --> 00:38:38.914 align:middle line:84%
and they're going, there's
something very creepy

00:38:38.914 --> 00:38:40.940 align:middle line:84%
about this place, I can't
put my finger on it,

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.780 align:middle line:90%
but this feels wrong.

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.410 align:middle line:84%
You also find burn
holes in the ground

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:50.310 align:middle line:84%
where it looks like lightning
has just hit in various places

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:52.947 align:middle line:90%
around there.

00:38:52.947 --> 00:38:54.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a very strange place.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were a
little disappointed

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.060 align:middle line:84%
in that after you
came back, you took

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.510 align:middle line:84%
all the readings,
magnetic readings

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and electrical readings,
and other than some spikes,

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:06.580 align:middle line:84%
there was nothing really
that interesting other

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:10.282 align:middle line:84%
than that arch popped up
out of nowhere seemingly.

00:39:10.282 --> 00:39:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: That's the
most remarkable thing

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:15.740 align:middle line:90%
about the whole story for us.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.930 align:middle line:84%
However, one thing
that did happen

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:21.330 align:middle line:84%
for Ron Quinn is
that he had heard

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:24.750 align:middle line:84%
the story from this Native
American about the young man

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:29.980 align:middle line:84%
who went through, and on
a subsequent visit walking

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:34.690 align:middle line:84%
around, once again looking for
mineral deposits and geodes

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and whatnot, he
found the remains,

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.155 align:middle line:84%
the skeleton, of a
Native American that

00:39:43.155 --> 00:39:50.660 align:middle line:84%
was on the far side of the
plateau, still in the of course

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.650 align:middle line:90%
now badly decomposed clothing.

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:56.190 align:middle line:90%
And the skeleton is there.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:40:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But this young man's
skeleton is lying there.

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:05.800 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't from the 1800s.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:10.606 align:middle line:90%
It was probably from the 1940s.

00:40:10.606 --> 00:40:14.650 align:middle line:84%
He must have died of
exposure, perhaps.

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And he just wondered, could
that have been the young man

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:19.270 align:middle line:90%
who jumped through?

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.633 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So one of the things
that we were curious about

00:40:22.633 --> 00:40:27.316 align:middle line:90%
was a story from a tombstone.

00:40:27.316 --> 00:40:29.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there are some
people familiar with those.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.000 align:middle line:84%
They said that there
was a pterodactyl flying

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.800 align:middle line:84%
over a tombstone
rancher's cattle,

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.400 align:middle line:84%
and taking calves and
flying off with them.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, these
ranchers got fed up with it,

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:48.280 align:middle line:84%
went chasing after it,
shot it with their guns,

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.595 align:middle line:84%
brought it back, tacked it
up on the side of a barn,

00:40:50.595 --> 00:40:53.150 align:middle line:90%
and now there's a picture.

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, we eventually
found a picture.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:59.220 align:middle line:84%
The picture had been printed
in the "Tombstone Gazette,"

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:02.210 align:middle line:90%
I think it was.

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:07.000 align:middle line:84%
But we eventually
found the picture.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.272 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like a
pterodactyl to me.

00:41:09.272 --> 00:41:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
like, what the heck?

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:12.650 align:middle line:90%
But where do that come from?

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And where did
that wind come from?

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And could it be--
and this is just theorizing,

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:24.240 align:middle line:84%
speculation-- but
if this portal is

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:31.710 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a gateway between
the past and the present,

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:34.490 align:middle line:84%
it opens up and it
creates a huge vacuum,

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:36.982 align:middle line:84%
or the air pressure
is different.

00:41:36.982 --> 00:41:39.190 align:middle line:84%
It would come blowing
right up that valley

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:40.170 align:middle line:90%
to where we were at.

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:42.780 align:middle line:90%


00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.650 align:middle line:84%
What if some
prehistoric creature

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:47.120 align:middle line:84%
were to have been
caught up in that

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:51.960 align:middle line:84%
and brought forward
in time to the 1800s?

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.010 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:55.468 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean, these
anomalies-- this whole notion

00:41:55.468 --> 00:41:57.180 align:middle line:84%
of the fabric of
time and space is

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.970 align:middle line:84%
another thing in these Wild
West years of discovery

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:02.500 align:middle line:90%
that we're in now.

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:07.570 align:middle line:84%
I was doing an interview with
Andrea Perron on her life,

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:11.090 align:middle line:84%
and the home that was
haunted that she lived in.

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And to me, the most
fascinating part of that story

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:20.090 align:middle line:84%
is that her mother was
looking at-- I believe

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:22.640 align:middle line:84%
it was her mother, not her
sister; but one or the other--

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.620 align:middle line:84%
was looking into their
dining room one day,

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and they saw a family who
had lived in that house

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:30.830 align:middle line:84%
maybe 100 years before
sitting at the table dining.

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:35.430 align:middle line:84%
But what was interesting
was the woman at the table

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:39.000 align:middle line:84%
saw her back, looked up
and looked over at her.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And they were
watching each other

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:42.600 align:middle line:90%
from different points in time.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:48.040 align:middle line:84%
That gave me the shivers,
because who's the ghost then?

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.310 align:middle line:84%
The woman back then
was seeing, obviously,

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:52.740 align:middle line:84%
this ghost from the
future looking at her.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:53.840 align:middle line:90%
Who is that woman?

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, the
same with Ron Quinn,

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.070 align:middle line:84%
sitting there looking through
binoculars, seeing himself.

00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.106 align:middle line:90%
That's what brought it up.

00:42:59.106 --> 00:43:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: There are
things that are so--

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these portals
are created somehow,

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:05.772 align:middle line:84%
whether it's
electrical or whatnot.

00:43:05.772 --> 00:43:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, and
that kind of brings us

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.310 align:middle line:84%
to a point where trying
to understand the fabric

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:15.280 align:middle line:90%
of our reality comes into play.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking that we are
living in a world that

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:27.630 align:middle line:84%
is composed of and controlled
by the electrical aspects

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:28.540 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.310 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
found in that story.

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:34.550 align:middle line:84%
When those anomalies
were occurring,

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:36.620 align:middle line:84%
their electric bill
would skyrocket

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:39.100 align:middle line:84%
because the entities
on the other side,

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.280 align:middle line:84%
it appears they were
able to manifest

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.530 align:middle line:84%
in part, at least
in their reality,

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:45.670 align:middle line:90%
with the use of electricity.

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:49.870 align:middle line:84%
That was a very key function
in these manifestations.

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So what we did
is we tried to figure out

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:59.170 align:middle line:84%
what the relationship is
to the electrical anomaly,

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:01.310 align:middle line:84%
the lightning
strikes that we saw.

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In quartz.

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.185 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: In the quartz,
and all of those.

00:44:04.185 --> 00:44:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Where is this place in
the scheme of things?

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Someone suggested, have
you looked at lay lines?

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well, that seems
like a pretty interesting

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.350 align:middle line:90%
concept.

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So we got a hold of one of
the world's foremost experts

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and asked him-- gave
him the GPS coordinates

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:31.570 align:middle line:84%
and said, what do you find about
this place, these coordinates?

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:37.100 align:middle line:84%
He called us back and said,
what did you find there?

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:39.370 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, what did you find?

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A tear
in time and space.

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: He says,
that is a point where

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:50.397 align:middle line:90%
six different lines collide.

00:44:50.397 --> 00:44:51.730 align:middle line:90%
It was right at the very center.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:55.550 align:middle line:84%
He says, where you took your
GPS coordinates, at probably

00:44:55.550 --> 00:45:01.790 align:middle line:84%
another 30 or 40 feet off to one
side is where all these lines--

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: --completely
just cross each other.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, where I was
standing was about 20 feet

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:11.070 align:middle line:84%
from the edge of this
plateau, and the very center

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:14.150 align:middle line:84%
was about 40 feet
towards the other part.

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:17.510 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go walk away back over
here and take a GPS reading.

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:19.175 align:middle line:84%
I just needed to
know where I was.

00:45:19.175 --> 00:45:21.710 align:middle line:90%


00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And I told him then
what we had found

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:28.450 align:middle line:90%
and what we were investigating.

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, there
are very few places

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:35.460 align:middle line:84%
like that in the world
where these lines of energy

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:38.430 align:middle line:84%
of this magnitude
actually cross.

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:middle line:90%
That's a real special place.

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So we have that as
a point of inquiry.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's interesting,
because the same is noted

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:50.820 align:middle line:90%
with the famous sacred sites.

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And as we talked
about yesterday,

00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:56.370 align:middle line:84%
the sacred octagonal sites
around the world that

00:45:56.370 --> 00:46:00.710 align:middle line:84%
have been created by those who
have passed down knowledge,

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:03.180 align:middle line:84%
and the rituals that
take place in those,

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:06.630 align:middle line:84%
including the ability to
fly beyond time and space--

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:09.150 align:middle line:84%
whether you call it remote
viewing or moving yourself

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:12.370 align:middle line:84%
to another time, you
get to gather knowledge

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:14.050 align:middle line:90%
or whatnot and glimpse.

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:16.750 align:middle line:84%
It appears that the
intersecting points

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:18.520 align:middle line:84%
of ley lines around
the planet have

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:23.560 align:middle line:84%
been where this activity
historically takes place.

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, this
is out of nowhere.

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:28.450 align:middle line:84%
It took someone like
you and Ron Quinn

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:30.690 align:middle line:90%
to dig this information up.

00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:32.740 align:middle line:84%
But some of them are
laying in plain sight

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.830 align:middle line:84%
as little temples, little
chapels, for people to go to.

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And that's where
our research took us.

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:44.940 align:middle line:84%
We then started wondering,
there's got to be other places.

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:48.372 align:middle line:84%
So we talked to our
friends who are Apache.

00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And they were
telling us about, oh,

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:51.580 align:middle line:90%
there's these places over here.

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:52.730 align:middle line:90%
But you can't go there.

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:54.116 align:middle line:90%
You're a white guy.

00:46:54.116 --> 00:46:57.370 align:middle line:84%
So, what does it take
to become an Apache?

00:46:57.370 --> 00:46:59.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, you can't do that.

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.220 align:middle line:90%
You can't go there.

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:01.145 align:middle line:90%
They'll kill you.

00:47:01.145 --> 00:47:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But then they told us the
stories about these places.

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's a place to go to the
past, where you go in here,

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.520 align:middle line:90%
you come out over there.

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's no distance
between these points.

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
Geronimo's legend.

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Exactly.

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we were invited to
go and see this for ourselves.

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.430 align:middle line:90%
The offer is still open.

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:28.350 align:middle line:90%
We haven't gone.

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:33.792 align:middle line:84%
And we plan to, because where
it is is real surprising.

00:47:33.792 --> 00:47:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not under
city hall somewhere.

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: No, no.

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:38.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:43.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's in Southern Arizona,
and it's just about 1,000 feet

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:46.856 align:middle line:90%
off the main highway right now.

00:47:46.856 --> 00:47:48.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's a place
where you go in,

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:50.420 align:middle line:90%
and you come out somewhere else.

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:51.580 align:middle line:90%
No one knows it's there.

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:54.030 align:middle line:90%
No one has a reason to go.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:57.297 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid of
rattlesnakes or whatever.

00:47:57.297 --> 00:47:58.630 align:middle line:90%
We're not afraid of any of that.

00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:59.580 align:middle line:90%
We'll go.

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.705 align:middle line:84%
And if it really works,
I'll come back and tell you

00:48:01.705 --> 00:48:02.530 align:middle line:90%
how it turned out.

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:03.480 align:middle line:90%
If it doesn't work--

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You'll travel back.

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Oh no.

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:07.551 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Or else
I'll come walking up

00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:10.750 align:middle line:84%
in just a moment offstage and
say, hi, I'm from the future.

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So
considering the nature

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:20.730 align:middle line:84%
of who you are and your unique
journey on the planet, what

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:23.400 align:middle line:84%
does this show you that might be
unique to who you are compared

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:27.580 align:middle line:84%
to maybe somebody else, what
you might gather from this

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:31.260 align:middle line:84%
or you might remember from
this about the traveling

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:33.250 align:middle line:84%
through time and
space and so forth?

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, for me,
it shows that there

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:44.120 align:middle line:84%
are mechanisms in
the universe that

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.660 align:middle line:84%
allow for this sort
of thing to occur.

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't unique
to this world.

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:55.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a part of all
planetary systems.

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And the people who understand
them or have access,

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:02.760 align:middle line:90%
they can use them as they want.

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps that's how
the people from one

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:10.790 align:middle line:84%
place to another
were able to travel,

00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and not necessarily in
ships or grand vehicles

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:20.640 align:middle line:84%
but in simply going, I need
to go see my relatives.

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.540 align:middle line:90%
Three steps, you're there.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And let's forward this story
to the technology of black ops

00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:31.270 align:middle line:84%
military operations, and
stories such as the one

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:36.200 align:middle line:84%
that Andrew Basiago tells of
the jump room in Sepulveda,

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:40.550 align:middle line:84%
where certain famous well-known
figures in our history,

00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:44.930 align:middle line:84%
some not as well
known-- modern history--

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:48.880 align:middle line:84%
were taken through the
process of time-jumping

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.580 align:middle line:84%
through technology,
that technology

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:54.320 align:middle line:84%
has to simply be mimicking
natural forces that

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:55.790 align:middle line:90%
already exist.

00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Maybe the
technology is there

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:01.790 align:middle line:90%
to support what's happening.

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:05.670 align:middle line:84%
We have technology in our
home so that we have lights,

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and we have a blender and
a telephone and so forth.

00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:13.020 align:middle line:84%
But the space that the home
is in was always there.

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.320 align:middle line:84%
We've just adapted
the surroundings

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.640 align:middle line:84%
to the space that
was always there.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:25.522 align:middle line:84%
With these things that
Basiago was talking about,

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:26.730 align:middle line:90%
there are so many different--

00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they were
used for specific military

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.220 align:middle line:84%
applications is the
point, to ascertain--

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:34.922 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But why was it put in
that particular place, you see?

00:50:34.922 --> 00:50:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, in
the case of him,

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:40.730 align:middle line:84%
it was the town
square in Santa Fe.

00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:43.150 align:middle line:90%
They had them jump there.

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:46.950 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, the point is,
they used technology

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:50.780 align:middle line:84%
to mimic natural phenomena
that may be exotic to us

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:56.120 align:middle line:84%
but perhaps might in the future
will probably be very common.

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: What you'll find
is that the technology

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:04.680 align:middle line:84%
is used to control
it, not to create it.

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:05.855 align:middle line:90%
You see, the reason why--

00:51:05.855 --> 00:51:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that makes sense.

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: The portal-- you could
go there and see this doorway

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:12.219 align:middle line:90%
on this plateau.

00:51:12.219 --> 00:51:14.260 align:middle line:84%
As I understand it, he'd
been up there many times

00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:15.510 align:middle line:90%
and seen nothing.

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:17.930 align:middle line:84%
He'd actually gone through,
walked back and forth

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:20.140 align:middle line:90%
very timidly-- nothing.

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:22.130 align:middle line:84%
But then something would
trigger, and he'd look

00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:24.960 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly the sky is bright
over there but it's dark here.

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe an
electromagnetic anomaly.

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Some charge
had taken place

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:32.519 align:middle line:84%
to bring this to its
potential for it to function.

00:51:32.519 --> 00:51:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That makes sense,
because you're right.

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Technology would be
used only to tame it,

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and use it for one's purpose
in a reliable fashion.

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:42.316 align:middle line:84%
So you have an off and
on switch, effectively.

00:51:42.316 --> 00:51:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Effectively, yes.

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:47.810 align:middle line:84%
This should be
common in our future,

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:51.470 align:middle line:84%
commonly used and
available, I would think.

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:53.807 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily desirable.

00:51:53.807 --> 00:51:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, it
might not be so bad.

00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:56.765 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
I'm just saying--

00:51:56.765 --> 00:51:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I mean, you've
got pictures of people

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:02.850 align:middle line:84%
from black and white
silent films showing

00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:04.910 align:middle line:84%
people who seem to be
from the future that

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:06.562 align:middle line:90%
are in these silent films.

00:52:06.562 --> 00:52:07.520 align:middle line:90%
How did they get there?

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the famous one about
the film "Back to the Future,"

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.290 align:middle line:84%
and foretelling
of events of 9/11

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and so forth from 40 years
before-- all of that, yeah.

00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:20.120 align:middle line:90%
Or 30 years.

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.980 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely fascinating
what the potential is.

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:26.540 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying these natural
phenomena have always existed,

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:29.080 align:middle line:84%
and certain people on the
land and of the land which

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.740 align:middle line:84%
would have been
indigenous peoples

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:33.470 align:middle line:84%
have probably been using
them throughout history.

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And the
medicine man-- we'll

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:40.260 align:middle line:84%
call them medicine man
or shaman, whatever--

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:43.240 align:middle line:84%
have a particular
level of awareness

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.850 align:middle line:90%
that they had tapped into.

00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:48.770 align:middle line:84%
They had a unique talent,
and that unique talent

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:51.580 align:middle line:84%
meant that their awareness
was intact to a point where

00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:57.000 align:middle line:84%
they had an understanding--
cause and effect.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.610 align:middle line:84%
What we might find
out, and what I

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:02.620 align:middle line:84%
wanted to go back
and experiment with,

00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:08.680 align:middle line:84%
was using the same techniques
I use in healing, sending

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:14.750 align:middle line:84%
that energy out to cause
an effect in this kind

00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:middle line:84%
of surrounding, because I
think that what we have here

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.510 align:middle line:84%
is an understanding by
these ancient peoples of how

00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:24.580 align:middle line:84%
they could control it
just by their presence.

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Maybe their presence was telling
them, oh, it's building up.

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:27.970 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it.

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:29.178 align:middle line:90%
It's getting ready to happen.

00:53:29.178 --> 00:53:30.850 align:middle line:90%
Now I'll get ready for this.

00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe their presence
was, I'm bringing things

00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:36.250 align:middle line:90%
to a point where it can occur.

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Don't know
what the answer is,

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.900 align:middle line:84%
but I think one of those two
has got to be what it is.

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And what these situations
are with whoever it--

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:52.260 align:middle line:84%
saying government is trite, but
scientists of some ilk that are

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:55.570 align:middle line:84%
creating a machine that causes
this to be a predictable

00:53:55.570 --> 00:54:01.010 align:middle line:84%
event-- is still an application
of awareness in a very long,

00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:05.700 align:middle line:84%
extended
way-off-to-the-left-side kind

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:06.780 align:middle line:90%
of realm.

00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:08.940 align:middle line:90%
But still, it's there.

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And I believe these portals
exist all over the place.

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:14.150 align:middle line:84%
One of the things we
started looking at

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:18.370 align:middle line:84%
were some very anomalous
places in the United States,

00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:21.120 align:middle line:84%
one of them being
Joplin, Missouri.

00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.260 align:middle line:84%
That's where my grandpa
is from, Joplin.

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.951 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: You've heard
of the Joplin lights.

00:54:26.951 --> 00:54:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: We went there.

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.930 align:middle line:84%
I could not fathom how this
could be something going on

00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:36.590 align:middle line:90%
and no one could figure it out.

00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:40.410 align:middle line:84%
So we went there with night
vision equipment and lasers

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:42.340 align:middle line:84%
and all the stuff that
we could put together,

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and Kathy and I went,
halfway believing

00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:47.880 align:middle line:90%
it might just be kind of hokey.

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Someone's making a big
mistake, of course.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.340 align:middle line:90%
We have to know, though.

00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:55.450 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you, it's one
of the strangest things

00:54:55.450 --> 00:54:57.680 align:middle line:90%
I've ever seen.

00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:02.790 align:middle line:84%
But what I think
we have uncovered

00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:06.710 align:middle line:84%
is that there is
another portal there,

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and when it activates you
see these balls of light.

00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:12.360 align:middle line:84%
The reason they're
in a specific area

00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:15.910 align:middle line:84%
is because that's probably there
right above or in proximity

00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:18.480 align:middle line:84%
to where one of
these doorways are.

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:21.860 align:middle line:84%
So we put that
theory to the test

00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and went driving
around in a very large

00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and getting larger
and larger square

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:31.370 align:middle line:84%
as best we could-- dirt roads,
back roads, and so forth.

00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:34.150 align:middle line:84%
What we discovered is where we
thought that the doorway would

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:40.570 align:middle line:84%
be, the portal, has a fence,
and it's government property.

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just like
the supposed stargate

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:46.330 align:middle line:84%
at the ancient city
of Ur, in Iraq,

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:49.310 align:middle line:84%
which the Americans built
a massive embassy around

00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:51.510 align:middle line:90%
so no one can access it.

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:54.440 align:middle line:84%
That's supposed to be a
well-known ancient stargate

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:56.640 align:middle line:90%
slash portal.

00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: As we continued
our investigation,

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:07.640 align:middle line:84%
we started coming
to terms with pins

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:13.490 align:middle line:84%
on a map that showed where
these things could be if based

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:17.810 align:middle line:84%
upon this idea, the notion
of these intersecting

00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:20.060 align:middle line:90%
lines of energy.

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And what we ended up
with was one somewhere

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:27.760 align:middle line:84%
in Southern New Mexico and
Western Texas, in that region.

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.410 align:middle line:90%
There is one there.

00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:30.500 align:middle line:90%
So we investigated.

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:32.150 align:middle line:90%
sure enough, there is.

00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:34.340 align:middle line:84%
No one will tell us
exactly where it is,

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:37.426 align:middle line:84%
but we have enough people
who've said, yeah, it's there.

00:56:37.426 --> 00:56:40.120 align:middle line:90%


00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Nearby, there are footprints
in sandstone that are human,

00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and there are dinosaur
footprints in sandstone

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:50.540 align:middle line:90%
there, too.

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:53.214 align:middle line:90%
The humans were running.

00:56:53.214 --> 00:56:54.130 align:middle line:90%
Is there a connection?

00:56:54.130 --> 00:56:55.510 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:56.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting
to consider.

00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:57.890 --> 00:57:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: The other
pins on the map

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:02.830 align:middle line:84%
represent churches
and state capitals.

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:05.983 align:middle line:84%
And that was part
of the discussion--

00:57:05.983 --> 00:57:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: --and
government installations.

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:08.195 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that
I had yesterday.

00:57:08.195 --> 00:57:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, yes.

00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So this tells me
that somebody somewhere

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:14.910 align:middle line:90%
knows something.

00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we kind
of mentioned this earlier

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:19.949 align:middle line:84%
about this certain
elite factions

00:57:19.949 --> 00:57:21.990 align:middle line:84%
that have known a lot
about this for a long time.

00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And in my interviews
with Cort Lindhal,

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:29.150 align:middle line:84%
we talk about the application
of that knowledge by you

00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:34.240 align:middle line:84%
can call them the elite,
the educated-- whatever.

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, it shows up
in those kinds of structures

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:38.735 align:middle line:90%
for particular use.

00:57:38.735 --> 00:57:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And I think
they know how to use it.

00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:42.990 align:middle line:84%
I know they go from
point to point using

00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:45.020 align:middle line:90%
this as a technique.

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:47.510 align:middle line:84%
So that brings us
to another point,

00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:51.280 align:middle line:84%
which is, OK, so if these
are going different points

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:56.560 align:middle line:84%
around the earth, they certainly
are going different worlds,

00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.624 align:middle line:90%
because it isn't limited.

00:57:57.624 --> 00:57:59.290 align:middle line:84%
When you go through
one of these things,

00:57:59.290 --> 00:58:01.580 align:middle line:90%
it's not limited to a region.

00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:07.260 align:middle line:84%
It is in an infinite place
back to a more finite place.

00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:08.465 align:middle line:90%
Distance becomes irrelevant.

00:58:08.465 --> 00:58:11.400 align:middle line:90%


00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And the people
living underground

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:16.450 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about
earlier in the conversation--

00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:17.540 align:middle line:90%
how do they get out?

00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This may be
one way they manifest.

00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And where
do they come from?

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:23.131 align:middle line:84%
And where is a safe place
for people from another world

00:58:23.131 --> 00:58:27.720 align:middle line:84%
to go to and then
interact up here?

00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:36.590 align:middle line:84%
UFOs possibly are just a part
of ourselves, revisiting this.

00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:37.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can be
all of the above.

00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well,
that's exactly it.

00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:48.190 align:middle line:84%
You see, what-- I don't
know how much time we have.

00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: About two minutes.

00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Then I'm going to
give it to you very quickly.

00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:54.550 align:middle line:84%
We discovered an
event that occurred

00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:59.040 align:middle line:90%
on the earth that's documented.

00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Kathy put the pieces together.

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:03.020 align:middle line:10%
It has to do with
something that occurred

00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:06.410 align:middle line:10%
about 50,000 years
ago, and how it all

00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:11.320 align:middle line:10%
relates to all of this--
the people from this world

00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:16.660 align:middle line:10%
not being from this world,
people that were left here,

00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:20.510 align:middle line:10%
deciding to stay here because
something was going to happen,

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:24.170 align:middle line:10%
and by the time it happened
there was very little that they

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:27.070 align:middle line:10%
could do except to survive.

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:30.240 align:middle line:10%
And who the Annunaki
were and who

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:36.850 align:middle line:10%
we are and all these
legends, gods and men-- it

00:59:36.850 --> 00:59:39.460 align:middle line:10%
all comes into very clear focus.

00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:40.710 align:middle line:90%
I'll bring that to you.

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm glad you got to
it, because I was thinking,

00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:43.900 align:middle line:84%
you've got to just
tease us a little bit

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:46.440 align:middle line:84%
the last couple minutes of
the show, and you just did.

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:49.095 align:middle line:84%
And so that means
we're having you back.

00:59:49.095 --> 00:59:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Kathy will
be here, and she'll

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:54.240 align:middle line:84%
help me to tell you
this complete story.

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I'm
looking forward to it.

00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Jerry, thank you
so much as always.

00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.402 align:middle line:84%
Enlightening,
entertaining-- I love it.

01:00:00.402 --> 01:00:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It's been wonderful.

01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:02.701 align:middle line:90%
What a privilege.

01:00:02.701 --> 01:00:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you haven't already
seen my previous interviews

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.180 align:middle line:84%
with Jerry, you can find them
here in the Open Mind archives.

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:12.440 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."
