00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:27.109 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Welcome to "Open Minds."

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.540 align:middle line:10%
We have a completely
different kind of show today.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:10%
Here with me is Sheila
Gillette and her husband Marcus

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:10%
Gillette, and we're going
to be bringing the Theo

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.700 align:middle line:10%
group in live.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And we have a live
studio audience, as well.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And beyond that, we have no
idea what's going to happen.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think, before we even
begin-- first of all, I

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.472 align:middle line:90%
want to say welcome, Marcus.

00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Last time you
weren't here with us.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.596 align:middle line:84%
But when you and Sheila are
doing your own channelings

00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:55.152 align:middle line:84%
with the public, you're
the one that's moderating.

00:00:55.152 --> 00:00:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
I have your job.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You have my job.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.270 align:middle line:10%
So today, I'm going to be
tossing a lot of that job

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.130 align:middle line:10%
over to you.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Thank you.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And so between now and
then, what we'll do

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.850 align:middle line:84%
is just chat a little bit and
introduce the subject at hand.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going to be
talking about reincarnation,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and soul contracts, and
patterns within families,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.091 align:middle line:90%
and soul groups.

00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: We are.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
have done this before.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: We have.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so give us
a little bit of an idea.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.310 align:middle line:90%
You can speak, Sheila.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: I know.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before
you're wiped out,

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and we don't get
to hear from you.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: Oh, well, you
definitely get to hear from me.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.900 align:middle line:10%
You know, we've talked a
lot about soul contracts.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:10%
And so has Theo, about
groups incarnating together

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.830 align:middle line:10%
to support each other's growth.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.730 align:middle line:10%
And so that's an
exciting conversation.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Because so many
people ask, you know,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel like I'm
part of my family.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel like I'm
in sync with anybody.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:84%
But Theo talks
about soul family,

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.040 align:middle line:84%
which can be more than our
physical nuclear family.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And that we need those
people along our path,

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.400 align:middle line:84%
because of that group energy
of deciding, if you go,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.900 align:middle line:90%
I'll go-- that type of things.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's always
interesting to know

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:84%
that it's a bigger, broader
spectrum of connectivity

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:84%
than we think of when we
think of just our third

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
physical reality, and
that we're in this family,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.814 align:middle line:90%
and that's all there is.

00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me--
and tell me what

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.837 align:middle line:84%
you think about this,
Marcus-- that it's almost,

00:02:26.837 --> 00:02:28.670 align:middle line:84%
like, everybody you run
into now, it's like,

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.010 align:middle line:90%
oh God, I've known you before.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you too.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like you
can't escape family

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:84%
from so many past
experiences together.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.200 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as though
it's a culmination

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.710 align:middle line:84%
point where a lot of the
people we're drawing in,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.680 align:middle line:90%
we already know now.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
Well, it's a vibration.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.466 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
It's an energy.

00:02:45.466 --> 00:02:47.160 align:middle line:84%
You meet somebody,
and it's, like,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.510 align:middle line:90%
where've you been all my life?

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a great
feeling when that happens.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.844 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Because
we-- Theo talks about the fact

00:02:54.844 --> 00:02:57.010 align:middle line:84%
that we're weeding the
garden of our life right now.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.850 align:middle line:84%
We're in this fifth
dimensionary energy.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a higher frequency.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And relationships that don't
have that connection just

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.620 align:middle line:90%
aren't fulfilling.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Maybe they're there.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're meeting
the other people,

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.900 align:middle line:84%
but we're walking
right past each other.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't even see
each other, in a sense.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.240 align:middle line:90%
There's no resonance.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Right.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
recognition isn't there.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE:
Theo often says,

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.880 align:middle line:84%
how many people in a
lifetime do you meet

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.500 align:middle line:90%
that you crossed paths with?

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.300 align:middle line:90%
Tens of thousands.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Especially if you go to
concerts, and games, and things

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.570 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.740 align:middle line:84%
You're always meeting people
and connecting with people,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:84%
or just passing
them on the street.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.810 align:middle line:84%
How many people do you
truly connect with?

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And when we connect
with somebody,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.547 align:middle line:84%
you know that true saying
about the eyes of the soul.

00:03:39.547 --> 00:03:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.171 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: It's
kind of like in "Avatar,"

00:03:42.171 --> 00:03:44.050 align:middle line:90%
the movie-- I see you.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:84%
It's that kind of
sensitivity that we get.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and if we have an emotional
response to that meeting,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:84%
whether it's
positive or negative,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.590 align:middle line:84%
we can be assured that we
have known that person before

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and will interact
with them again.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:84%
I've met people on the
streets of New York when

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.260 align:middle line:90%
I've been there working.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I met this one woman,
for an example,

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.220 align:middle line:84%
where I passed her on the
street in Greenwich Village.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I was staying there as I
was working with clients.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.910 align:middle line:90%
I took note of her.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.779 align:middle line:90%
I looked at her.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.829 align:middle line:84%
I remembered she
had riding clothes

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.519 align:middle line:90%
on-- horseback riding clothes.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And she had two big black
dogs she was walking.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And I went, oh,
that's interesting.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'd had enough
experience to go,

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.410 align:middle line:90%
I may see this person again.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Three years later--
knock, knock,

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.250 align:middle line:84%
knock at the door of where I was
staying to do private readings.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:90%
It was that woman.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I know you described
her completely,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and she lived on the street
that I walked past her on,

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:90%
and she registered.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And we all have those
kinds of experience,

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.400 align:middle line:90%
where people register with us.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And then later on, show up
in our life at some time.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.230 align:middle line:90%
And it's all timing.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.040 align:middle line:84%
There's just these
connections that we have,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.600 align:middle line:84%
energetically,
that we don't see,

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.859 align:middle line:84%
that people come into our
lives at the right time.

00:05:04.859 --> 00:05:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But we can feel them.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.310 align:middle line:90%
We can feel them.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.790 align:middle line:84%
There is that recognition
and resonance,

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.880 align:middle line:84%
like, you don't have to
have a definition for it.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.550 align:middle line:90%
Just, I notice you.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:90%
I see you.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
often, we do not

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.300 align:middle line:84%
have resonance
with our own family

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.250 align:middle line:84%
members, which is why we're
talking about this today, too.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Because those are
the painful ones.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Why did we choose
to do this together?

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.650 align:middle line:90%
And what is there to learn?

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And so Theo is going to get
into a lot of that, as well.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And I just want the
audience to know

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:84%
that if you're called upon,
or if you ask a question,

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.730 align:middle line:84%
it really can be on any
of those levels involved.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:40.700 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So in a moment, you're
going to say bye-bye to us.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.792 align:middle line:84%
You'll go away and the Theo
group will come through.

00:05:47.792 --> 00:05:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: Yes.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, you're
comfortable with that?

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
what's going to happen.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.016 align:middle line:84%
We have our cameras
and our lights

00:05:53.016 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:84%
set up for a nice, tidy
little conversation.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.630 align:middle line:84%
But Theo may sprint
across the studio,

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.135 align:middle line:90%
and you may be out the door.

00:05:59.135 --> 00:05:59.635 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:59.635 --> 00:06:02.500 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just see what happens,
and play it by ear that way,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So why don't you go
ahead and do your thing,

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and recede, and allow
Theo to come forward.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.920 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.085 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE:
Are we all already?

00:06:11.085 --> 00:06:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: All right.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Do you
want to talk a little bit

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:13.950 align:middle line:90%
about what happens?

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: Well, what
happens is, I'll close my eyes.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:84%
I'll take a few
deep breaths, which

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.940 align:middle line:90%
allows me to relax and let go.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to do the
same-- because I know we

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.620 align:middle line:84%
all get a little tense when
we're in this situation.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll allow
Theo to come through.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.516 align:middle line:84%
I invite Theo to come in,
and then they'll speak first.

00:06:35.516 --> 00:06:37.390 align:middle line:84%
They'll say this is the
beginning, is it not?

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:90%
That's how it's always started.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
off and running.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.250 align:middle line:84%
So we'll see what they
have to say to us.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.686 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And will Theo let
us know, then, whether or not

00:06:50.686 --> 00:06:52.310 align:middle line:84%
they wish to call
upon people, or would

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.160 align:middle line:84%
like people to raise their
hand and volunteer questions?

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.630 align:middle line:90%
They'll let us know, right?

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: They will.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.750 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.916 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: We'll
pretty much just guide them

00:06:59.916 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:90%
to picking--

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, that sounds good.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going
to moderate that part.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.200 align:middle line:84%
But I may chime in, and say, but
wait, I have a question, too.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: What is this
do you think it's your show?

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just have
a question or two.

00:07:10.495 --> 00:07:11.497 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: You
always have good questions.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:40.020 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.645 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It is the
beginning, is it not?

00:07:41.645 --> 00:07:42.686 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: It is.

00:07:42.686 --> 00:07:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Theo.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: We are appreciative
of the opportunity

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:90%
to be of service unto you.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:47.870 align:middle line:90%
You may ask.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.661 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
Well, Theo, as you know,

00:07:49.661 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
reincarnation and soul family

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:52.350 align:middle line:90%
contracts.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.610 align:middle line:84%
How would you like to
begin our dialogue?

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: The
multi-dimensionality of the soul

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.880 align:middle line:90%
is what you wish to speak about.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.930 align:middle line:84%
That this earthly
plane but one choice

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.895 align:middle line:84%
of experience for a soul,
choosing this human experience

00:08:07.895 --> 00:08:10.190 align:middle line:90%
is that of emotions.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And the interaction
of each other that

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:20.710 align:middle line:84%
teaches the emotional balance
that occurs out of love.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And bringing it forward
into present incarnation,

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:30.070 align:middle line:84%
and that sense of wholeness
and divinity that you are,

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.120 align:middle line:84%
a recognition of
masterhood is at hand.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.110 align:middle line:84%
The fifth dimensionary
energy is fully in place now,

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.039 align:middle line:84%
for that fuller
expression and experience.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And the souls here, in
choosing to be participating,

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.520 align:middle line:84%
have allowed that frequency
to permeate to allow

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.100 align:middle line:90%
the masterhood to come forth.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:00.420 align:middle line:84%
By choosing incarnation,
there is a choice,

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.900 align:middle line:84%
with groups incarnating together
to support each other's growth.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:10.250 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:14.980 align:middle line:10%
Challenging at times, which
is the greatest teacher.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.447 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:09:16.447 --> 00:09:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Indeed.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: There is an asking?

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: You talk
about the process of birth

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:22.810 align:middle line:90%
to birth.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Not birth to death,
but birth to birth--

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.235 align:middle line:84%
birthing into a new
experience after we

00:09:26.235 --> 00:09:28.470 align:middle line:90%
leave the physical body.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Bring us, kind of full
circle, to that point

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.310 align:middle line:84%
in time-- of course,
there's no time

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:84%
at that point-- where
souls gather in spirit,

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and actually start
to determine what's

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.810 align:middle line:84%
going to happen in this
next upcoming incarnation.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.790 align:middle line:10%
>>THEO: Souls in
alignment, as we

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.780 align:middle line:10%
would call soul family, on the
same vibrational frequency,

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:55.550 align:middle line:10%
have interaction with others
lifetime after lifetime,

00:09:55.550 --> 00:10:00.380 align:middle line:10%
and that support, and choosing
times of change of which they

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:10%
all have interest in the
sense of the evolution

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.640 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness that is now.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.270 align:middle line:10%
That choosing a particular
time, vibrationally,

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.440 align:middle line:10%
occurs in an agreement.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.440 align:middle line:10%
It is not sitting about
a conference room,

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.900 align:middle line:10%
as one might perceive it.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.610 align:middle line:84%
But you could, if you wished
in your conscious mind,

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.710 align:middle line:90%
if that's comfortable.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.340 align:middle line:10%
For the conscious mind has not
a picture of what it looks like.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.310 align:middle line:10%
For it is a vibrational
connectivity

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.605 align:middle line:10%
that is always communicating.

00:10:32.605 --> 00:10:34.766 align:middle line:90%


00:10:34.766 --> 00:10:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: I think we
have had this notion, Theo,

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.470 align:middle line:84%
that souls-- and we've even
heard this-- that souls really

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.420 align:middle line:90%
treasure the human experience.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
popular choice for souls.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.750 align:middle line:90%
Can you speak to that please?

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: The Earth is a
beautiful place to experience.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.350 align:middle line:10%
A place of finite
human experience

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.690 align:middle line:10%
in a physical structure,
that interacts with others

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.480 align:middle line:10%
through the emotional
experiences with them, that

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.450 align:middle line:10%
is exquisite learning, that
has the ability to show love,

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:13.122 align:middle line:10%
to experience love physically,
mentally, and spiritually.

00:11:13.122 --> 00:11:15.580 align:middle line:10%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: And what's
the main purpose for choosing

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.510 align:middle line:10%
a human incarnation?

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: The beauty
of that experience.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Emotional learning-- the
different aspects of emotions.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.170 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:33.670 align:middle line:10%
It's quite a
spectrum, is it not?

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have a
question relating

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.140 align:middle line:84%
to that, which is, are
there many other planets--

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.580 align:middle line:84%
in other places,
dimensions, and such--

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.690 align:middle line:84%
where this same
opportunity is given?

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Or is Earth among
maybe only a handful

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.157 align:middle line:84%
where that express
lesson is offered?

00:11:50.157 --> 00:11:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: There are
billions of choices,

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.860 align:middle line:84%
similar to the Earthly
plane, in which

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.890 align:middle line:90%
a soul can choose to incarnate.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:10%
There is but a small number of
those in which the learning is

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.920 align:middle line:10%
emotionally based.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Are there
some types of cultures,

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.390 align:middle line:10%
off-planet cultures,
that may be very highly

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle line:10%
advanced intellectually,
and so forth,

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:18.480 align:middle line:10%
that maybe begin choosing to
learn this aspect of life,

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.030 align:middle line:10%
individually or collectively?

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is, if you
have a very advanced culture,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.190 align:middle line:84%
say technologically
or intellectually,

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.460 align:middle line:84%
do they sometimes
en masse choose

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.100 align:middle line:84%
to start bringing in
a new kind of emotion

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.410 align:middle line:84%
and having this experience
we're having on Earth?

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.420 align:middle line:10%
>>THEO: And they've been
seen by some, yes-- that are

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:10%
observational, at this point.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:46.390 align:middle line:10%
And know, on the soul
level, that each of you

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:51.540 align:middle line:10%
has a choice to be in
their environment, as well.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.070 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do you feel,
Marcus, about getting what you

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.800 align:middle line:90%
were-- what you wanted to say?

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.633 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: I
have one quick thought.

00:12:58.633 --> 00:13:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And so Theo, Earth
is what you have

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.220 align:middle line:84%
said many times-- the
place we incarnate

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:90%
to experience emotions.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.270 align:middle line:84%
What I'm hearing you say now is
that there are other planetary

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.950 align:middle line:84%
or dimensional experiences
that, indeed, do also

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:90%
experience emotions?

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:18.220 align:middle line:10%
>>THEO: They experience
some of them, yes.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.230 align:middle line:84%
The Earth experiences the
whole spectrum, you see.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.730 align:middle line:10%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Right.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.570 align:middle line:10%
>>THEO: We call it
the physical body.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.450 align:middle line:10%
There is, from the
third dimension,

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:35.700 align:middle line:10%
the physical reality which
first ones delve into,

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:10%
that have particular
densities to them, that

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.780 align:middle line:10%
has had the default to fear.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:49.190 align:middle line:10%
However, now there's
a shift and change

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:52.890 align:middle line:10%
in the neural pathways
in the human experience

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.270 align:middle line:10%
in the body that is occurring.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.190 align:middle line:10%
So that is not the default.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:03.710 align:middle line:10%
The default can go to the higher
levels of experience of love.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:11.350 align:middle line:10%
So it's been a process, you see,
as the physical bodies align

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.000 align:middle line:10%
to a higher vibrational
frequency, of which we

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:10%
call the fifth
dimension now, which

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:22.420 align:middle line:10%
allows the soul the
experience of expansion,

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.650 align:middle line:10%
knowing that, that
which is within you

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:29.190 align:middle line:10%
is greater than that which
is your body, or outside you.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.425 align:middle line:10%
And to have that realization.

00:14:31.425 --> 00:14:33.480 align:middle line:90%


00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
Very interesting.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.146 align:middle line:84%
And would you like to select
an audience member now,

00:14:37.146 --> 00:14:38.530 align:middle line:90%
Theo, to come sit with you?

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:41.445 align:middle line:84%
There are many who
are asking, we hear.

00:14:41.445 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:90%


00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:46.440 align:middle line:90%
This one.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:57.044 align:middle line:90%


00:14:57.044 --> 00:14:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hello, Theo.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: We are appreciative
of the opportunity

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.684 align:middle line:90%
to be of service unto you.

00:15:03.684 --> 00:15:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: You may ask.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I suppose
the question I have is

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.510 align:middle line:84%
that, through conditioning
of our family groups

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and our units that we may
not feel that vibration

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:28.218 align:middle line:84%
and connection with, we're
trained, or untrained,

00:15:28.218 --> 00:15:32.390 align:middle line:90%
to be in acceptance.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.220 align:middle line:90%
Or we have broken relationships.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
us-- or I, personally--

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.980 align:middle line:84%
have focused a lot of effort
on healing relationships,

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:49.686 align:middle line:84%
then that feels like
it's not progressing.

00:15:49.686 --> 00:15:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Or that it may be
progressing, but it's never

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.320 align:middle line:90%
actually concluding.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And my end goal
for that healing is

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.590 align:middle line:84%
that I want to
live in acceptance

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and I want to be in a
vibrational place that

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:90%
allows in.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:16.090 align:middle line:84%
But I feel cut off
by my relationships.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Cutting off,
particularly in your family

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle line:84%
relationships, have been
so in the sense of not

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000 align:middle line:90%
being heard or understood.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Not speaking the same
language, you might say.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.795 align:middle line:84%
For there is, as you wish
to expand in your spirit,

00:16:33.795 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle line:84%
there is a lack of
acceptance for that,

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.200 align:middle line:84%
because of the
rigidity that is there.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So it has separated you as
you tried to speak about it

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and to share the
information that you know.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:58.630 align:middle line:90%
It is held in negative thought.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, you feel judged and
set apart from not being heard.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.510 align:middle line:90%


00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: First off, these family
members are not soul family.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:16.859 align:middle line:84%
You're not on the
same frequency,

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:19.109 align:middle line:84%
so they will never
understand you.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So knowing this, in
trying to convert them

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.260 align:middle line:84%
to your way of thinking,
will only bring heartache.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.150 align:middle line:90%
You've already found that.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: So you are
seeking those whom

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:40.460 align:middle line:84%
have the same frequencies as
you, and you are meeting them.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Few in number, but
with great depth.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:50.450 align:middle line:10%
So you do have a family.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:55.720 align:middle line:84%
However, your genetic family--
you can love them as they

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.720 align:middle line:84%
are, with the calmness
and understanding

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.820 align:middle line:84%
that they're not
going to change,

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.830 align:middle line:90%
releasing that expectation.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:09.110 align:middle line:84%
You came in as a way
shower in that group,

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:12.550 align:middle line:84%
of a new way of being that is
being birthed on this planet.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Now you are a participant
in the energy, as well as

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.270 align:middle line:90%
a facilitator.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And the loneliness
that you have felt,

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:26.670 align:middle line:84%
is because of that leadership,
or way shower opportunity,

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.990 align:middle line:90%
that your soul has chosen.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a new paradigm, you see.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:90%
The judgment brings you sadness.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And the
expectation of being

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:84%
loved unmet in the unconditional
love that you desire.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.460 align:middle line:90%


00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.560 align:middle line:90%
It will come from others.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.930 align:middle line:84%
They love you as they can,
the best that they can,

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:84%
with the knowledge that
they have presently.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:04.980 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:10%
If you think, and your
particularly-- both the mother

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:18.280 align:middle line:10%
and the father, but the
father is very rigid--

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.790 align:middle line:10%
that brings sadness.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:25.580 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And he needs it the
most, in your perception.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:29.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.239 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Your closed heart.

00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:34.905 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:34.905 --> 00:19:37.690 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: When he ages, when
he's older than he is now,

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.380 align:middle line:84%
his heart will open
and you'll find

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.630 align:middle line:90%
quite pleasurable conversation.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:47.755 align:middle line:90%
But it will be a few years.

00:19:47.755 --> 00:19:50.590 align:middle line:90%


00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:54.580 align:middle line:84%
But what you can do now is
know that he doesn't know

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:90%
how to be different than he is.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:01.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not that he's refusing it.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.834 align:middle line:90%
That's a difference, isn't it?

00:20:03.834 --> 00:20:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.458 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Not a refusing.

00:20:05.458 --> 00:20:07.970 align:middle line:90%


00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:15.230 align:middle line:84%
An unknowing shifts the
energy for your perception.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:84%
So you can love him as he
is, not try to convert him.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:24.090 align:middle line:84%
That's where the energy
becomes conflictual.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Live your life as you live it.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:28.290 align:middle line:90%
Be the example.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Not the teller or the converter,
but the shower-- the way

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:90%
shower.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And he will come
to you in his age,

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.930 align:middle line:90%
as he ages, and asks you more.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And in his asking,
you can share.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.420 align:middle line:10%
And you will be verified.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Your mother is more accepting,
but she follows the line

00:20:56.270 --> 00:21:00.640 align:middle line:84%
that he has set as
the family structure.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And their relationship
is quite bonded,

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:90%
so she will do whatever he does.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.125 align:middle line:84%
But she will open
sooner than he.

00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:15.800 align:middle line:90%


00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.854 align:middle line:90%
But they love you.

00:21:17.854 --> 00:21:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Very much.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very much.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And so you have that--
in the best way that they can,

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:30.270 align:middle line:84%
with what they know,
and what they believe.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.860 align:middle line:90%
You have changed beliefs.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:84%
You have a broader perspective,
and it will come in time.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So the family that you seek, the
understanding, and the knowing,

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:47.060 align:middle line:84%
and the acceptance that
you desire is coming now,

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.690 align:middle line:90%
and it's already begun.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.250 align:middle line:90%
And that is your soul family.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:54.160 align:middle line:90%


00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Will you allow
me one more question?

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:56.934 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: You may.

00:21:56.934 --> 00:21:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.720 align:middle line:90%
I tend to worry much too much.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Does my soul know best how
to be a leader already?

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You are
a leader already.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.550 align:middle line:84%
The worry comes of
how you're going

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:84%
to express it, more than
the knowing that you are,

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.150 align:middle line:90%
and the being heard.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:24.280 align:middle line:84%
So what you're doing is gaining
the confidence in that knowing.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.780 align:middle line:90%
So look at how far you've come.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.930 align:middle line:10%
The knowing that you already
have is quite profound,

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:34.160 align:middle line:10%
and it is to be shared.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.040 align:middle line:10%
You've already
begun that, as well.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.510 align:middle line:10%
So you make a business plan.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.970 align:middle line:84%
For that is your
business, isn't it?

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:49.035 align:middle line:84%
So you make a business
plan, for it feeds you.

00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Do not be off put
by others, who say, ah,

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:54.750 align:middle line:90%
you are a spiritual teacher.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:90%
Why do you charge for it?

00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.115 align:middle line:90%
You're a spiritual leader.

00:22:59.115 --> 00:23:01.860 align:middle line:90%


00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:07.560 align:middle line:84%
They're paying for your
time and your wisdom.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you weren't having
it as this structure,

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.104 align:middle line:84%
you would have to have
another job, would you not?

00:23:14.104 --> 00:23:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And that's not
your path or purpose.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:23.904 align:middle line:90%
So own your power now.

00:23:23.904 --> 00:23:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And the only
question of money

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.520 align:middle line:90%
comes from your belief about it.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:84%
You are worthy to be
paid for your wisdom.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.884 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.884 --> 00:23:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
I have one question.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Theo, what would be
the higher purpose

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.560 align:middle line:84%
of choosing a
physical family that

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.027 align:middle line:90%
is not soul family members?

00:23:46.027 --> 00:23:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: When you are
a teacher, that's

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:49.420 align:middle line:84%
the best place to
begin teaching--

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.370 align:middle line:84%
in the very
beginning-- isn't it?

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:53.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And learning how
to do the dance,

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:02.330 align:middle line:84%
intuitively, of where
they're ready to hear.

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.960 align:middle line:84%
For you can't come to them
at the university level

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.050 align:middle line:84%
when they're at the
elementary level.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So that is why, in
their asking, when

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:17.770 align:middle line:84%
they begin to ask questions, you
don't give them the whole book.

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:20.881 align:middle line:90%
You give them the first chapter.

00:24:20.881 --> 00:24:21.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:25.391 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: And it is so.

00:24:25.391 --> 00:24:26.365 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:26.365 --> 00:24:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: There is an asking.

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.226 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Who
would you like to pick?

00:24:33.226 --> 00:24:36.670 align:middle line:90%


00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: This one.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:45.355 align:middle line:90%


00:24:45.355 --> 00:24:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Along with Marcus's question
of genetic versus soul family--

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:56.250 align:middle line:84%
people choose genetic families
because the genetic families

00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:02.050 align:middle line:84%
provide the pressure
that enables someone

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:09.420 align:middle line:84%
to grow, and mature, and develop
their own sense of soulness,

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.660 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:17.740 align:middle line:84%
So that when they go out in the
world, what happens around them

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.170 align:middle line:90%
doesn't really affect them.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: To some degree
you are correct.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.800 align:middle line:84%
We speak only of that which
is your experience, where

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.660 align:middle line:90%
it has been quite off-putting.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.070 align:middle line:90%
and judgmental.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:10%
So you, on your own way, has
been a warrior in that field.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:40.050 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And coming from the arena
in which you come from,

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:90%
very staid and political.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes,
very judgmental.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:53.590 align:middle line:90%
Very harsh.

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Political.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:56.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And one must adhere
to the rules.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:25:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And if one varies
it any way, shape, or form,

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:10.070 align:middle line:90%
then there is a separation.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Or threat of.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: So what it
has to you, in being

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.810 align:middle line:84%
that way shower
that you have been,

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:29.200 align:middle line:84%
has had the pain of the
being ostracized and judged

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.976 align:middle line:84%
for the knowing that you
have, which was quite strong.

00:26:32.976 --> 00:26:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, it's
been very painful.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I finally
just decided--

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and just breathing
into the future.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And the less I care
about that over here,

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:52.400 align:middle line:84%
the more-- it's like the
universe is just throwing

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.730 align:middle line:90%
me people and situations.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Ah, that is what
we speak about, isn't it?

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:03.770 align:middle line:10%
Soul family comes
forward when there

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:09.870 align:middle line:10%
is less attachment to
acceptance in genetic family

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.150 align:middle line:10%
in which one does not resonate.

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:17.430 align:middle line:84%
But there's still
the desire of love.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:26.370 align:middle line:84%
It is natural to an individual
from family, parents, siblings.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:31.250 align:middle line:84%
That need for love is
the human experience.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So what you're recognizing
is the loving of self

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:40.260 align:middle line:84%
allows for that love to be
experienced, to whatever degree

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:84%
that it can be given, without
resistance or judgment.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:54.490 align:middle line:10%
So what you have done, when
you release that caring,

00:27:54.490 --> 00:28:00.020 align:middle line:10%
and love the self enough to
allow the release of caring,

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:05.050 align:middle line:10%
you can accept what is
there, as it is, with joy.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And bring in the
love of soul family

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.760 align:middle line:90%
and the outer connections now.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So do you have any information
on the procession of that,

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.760 align:middle line:90%
that I'm engaging in now?

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.785 align:middle line:90%
Just keep going?

00:28:25.785 --> 00:28:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: That is what
life is, isn't it?

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.680 align:middle line:90%
You've chosen to be here.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.442 align:middle line:90%
The expansion is now.

00:28:32.442 --> 00:28:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I just feel
like, sometimes, things

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.200 align:middle line:90%
are so complicated.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.668 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't need
to be, does it?

00:28:38.668 --> 00:28:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: It is not complicated.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.390 align:middle line:84%
It is your intellect,
because you

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:47.140 align:middle line:84%
are so bright and intelligent,
that complicates it.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Be in the center of your soul.

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:52.070 align:middle line:84%
It is what your
mind does with it--

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:57.120 align:middle line:84%
the what ifs, the judgments,
the analyzation that

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.880 align:middle line:90%
seems complicated.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.400 align:middle line:84%
So when you enter
the heart space,

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.070 align:middle line:84%
the center point of
your soul is calm--

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:09.420 align:middle line:84%
that is why meditation
is excellent.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.870 align:middle line:84%
When you are in
that center point,

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:16.740 align:middle line:84%
the allowance of what is to come
in its highest good is there.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're experiencing
it, as we speak.

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Do you have
an affirmation for that,

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.840 align:middle line:90%
going deep into your soul?

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: I am the center
point of my soul.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:31.710 align:middle line:84%
I open and receive
all love that is mine,

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:38.868 align:middle line:84%
inside and outside
my physical being.

00:29:38.868 --> 00:29:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you, Theo.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: You
have one follow-up.

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: You may ask.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:44.678 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
We all want love

00:29:44.678 --> 00:29:45.910 align:middle line:90%
from our mothers and fathers.

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And when we don't get it,
and our mothers and fathers

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:53.539 align:middle line:84%
pass-- what do our
mothers and fathers-- what

00:29:53.539 --> 00:29:55.580 align:middle line:84%
is the realization they
have, and what would they

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.800 align:middle line:84%
like to say to their children
after they're in the spirit

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.442 align:middle line:84%
world, that they didn't say
to them in this lifetime?

00:30:02.442 --> 00:30:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, you could
use me as an example.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Ah, we will.

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, because we've
been doing this for awhile.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: The example that you ask
for is your parents love you.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.750 align:middle line:10%
And in this broader perspective,
that just is given now,

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:25.890 align:middle line:10%
and in that sense of love, that
is inexplicable in evolving

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:10%
into the other dimensional
realm, understanding now, more

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:37.440 align:middle line:10%
than ever before, you--
the acceptance of you,

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.174 align:middle line:10%
and the purest of love,
is given unto you.

00:30:41.174 --> 00:30:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:44.565 align:middle line:90%
For that.

00:30:44.565 --> 00:30:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Ah, if they would've
known in their embodiment what

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:55.770 align:middle line:84%
they know now, they would
have acted quite differently.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.695 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So that's sort of--
you're using me as an example.

00:30:58.695 --> 00:31:01.040 align:middle line:84%
But that's sort of
universal, isn't it?

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It is true for all,
yes, in similar circumstance.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:10.420 align:middle line:10%
But there's a much
broader perspective

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.770 align:middle line:10%
in the
multi-dimensionality realms

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.250 align:middle line:10%
than in the earthly,
finite existence.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:18.812 align:middle line:90%


00:31:18.812 --> 00:31:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:21.332 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: There is an asking.

00:31:21.332 --> 00:31:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Yes.

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:23.414 align:middle line:90%
Who would you like to pick?

00:31:23.414 --> 00:31:27.442 align:middle line:90%


00:31:27.442 --> 00:31:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: This one.

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:32.480 align:middle line:90%


00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.923 align:middle line:90%
You asked before, we heard.

00:31:34.923 --> 00:31:38.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:40.674 align:middle line:90%


00:31:40.674 --> 00:31:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I would like to ask
about inter-dimensional soul

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:47.190 align:middle line:90%
relationships.

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So yourself, Theo, with Sheila--
channelers and their channeled

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:57.000 align:middle line:84%
entities and the relationships
that we're having

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.110 align:middle line:84%
on inter-dimensional
soul planes--

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: To the
guidance of mentors,

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.630 align:middle line:84%
that have been
ever-present about each

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:11.190 align:middle line:84%
and every one of you, and the
direct connectivity to them.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm to ask in this sitting,
as speaking through another,

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.250 align:middle line:90%
such as the Sheila.

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:21.882 align:middle line:84%
Your specific question
is about that.

00:32:21.882 --> 00:32:24.480 align:middle line:10%
What?

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: The significance
of the relationship

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:30.470 align:middle line:90%
between you and Sheila.

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And whether that's chosen before
you guys activated together

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and she began interacting
with and becoming you,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.780 align:middle line:90%
for her purpose.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: There was an
asking of this work

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:49.860 align:middle line:84%
to be done in and through her,
and an acceptance on a soul

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.840 align:middle line:84%
level that there would be
this combining of efforts,

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.670 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:33:00.600 align:middle line:10%
In the sense of the teaching
and mentorship for the time now,

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.030 align:middle line:10%
that is so profound.

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.960 align:middle line:84%
So, in essence,
to your question--

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:09.050 align:middle line:84%
there is an agreement that is
made for the allowance of us

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:13.405 align:middle line:84%
to use this physical structure
in such a way to inform.

00:33:13.405 --> 00:33:18.310 align:middle line:90%


00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And each and every one of
you has guidance and mentors,

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:31.166 align:middle line:84%
presence about you, as you open
to that possibility and ask.

00:33:31.166 --> 00:33:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.712 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: There is a question?

00:33:34.712 --> 00:33:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:40.800 align:middle line:84%
The effect-- the change
that, for example,

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:45.320 align:middle line:84%
your body or Sheila's
body experiences

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:49.310 align:middle line:84%
when she is in her soul
relationship with Theo,

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:52.750 align:middle line:90%
and how that's altering her.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the energy
is so palpable

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:58.700 align:middle line:84%
when you experience being in
the room with a channeler.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So I'm curious what the
conduit effect for you is?

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.010 align:middle line:90%


00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:09.147 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: For us entering the
body, or for the body itself?

00:34:09.147 --> 00:34:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: For you
entering the body,

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:14.929 align:middle line:84%
I'm probably more curious
about for Sheila, actually.

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: That is what we thought.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.389 align:middle line:10%
It has been an ongoing
process of adjustment

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:22.460 align:middle line:10%
on a frequency and
a cellular level,

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:26.469 align:middle line:10%
to allow with comfort this
energy to enter the body.

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:30.460 align:middle line:84%
For it's a very high,
powerful electrical input,

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.989 align:middle line:84%
you might say, in a
better understanding

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:35.370 align:middle line:90%
of how that can occur.

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:40.260 align:middle line:84%
So there has been an
adjustment over time, ongoing,

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:48.290 align:middle line:84%
to allow more clarity and more
energy to embody, if you would,

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:54.090 align:middle line:84%
a cellular adjustment on a
frequency level that occurs,

00:34:54.090 --> 00:35:03.700 align:middle line:84%
for this conjoining of
the physical and us.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And at times, it has been
quite intense for her.

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:08.690 align:middle line:90%
And for others, as well.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:11.530 align:middle line:90%


00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:14.775 align:middle line:84%
But now it seems as
it is easy, because it

00:35:14.775 --> 00:35:19.060 align:middle line:84%
has been a great amount of time
of adjustment and fine-tuning.

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Nor is it easy at first,
because of resistance.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Not a resistance of
acceptance, but a resistance

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:32.364 align:middle line:84%
energetically to fine-tune
on that cellular level.

00:35:32.364 --> 00:35:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.696 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
And while we're

00:35:34.696 --> 00:35:37.300 align:middle line:84%
talking about frequency scale--
after you're in Sheila's body,

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.865 align:middle line:84%
and speaking through her,
what is it that connects you

00:35:39.865 --> 00:35:42.507 align:middle line:90%
to the soul of the questioner?

00:35:42.507 --> 00:35:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: There is a bridge.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.730 align:middle line:84%
There is a key
note to your voice,

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:49.380 align:middle line:84%
that we cross the
bridge into your soul.

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's different
and unique unto them.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:36:01.730 align:middle line:10%
So as we hear, your mind thought
has that key note, as well as

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:05.485 align:middle line:10%
the tenor of your voice.

00:36:05.485 --> 00:36:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: There is an asking.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: There is.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: This one.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:14.990 align:middle line:90%


00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:16.975 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:16.975 --> 00:36:19.494 align:middle line:10%
>>THEO: We are
appreciative to serve.

00:36:19.494 --> 00:36:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm feeling like
I'm on a precipice in my life

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:24.810 align:middle line:84%
right now, and literally
on the verge of launching

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:27.190 align:middle line:90%
into a different direction.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And part of my
feeling is that I've

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:34.350 align:middle line:84%
spent the last number of years
being quiet, and really doing

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:36.100 align:middle line:84%
my work to connect to
my soul, and connect

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.290 align:middle line:90%
to that presence with myself.

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:42.309 align:middle line:84%
And now, as I'm sensing
going out into the world,

00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:44.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm almost having this
feeling like my soul

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.190 align:middle line:90%
family is shifting.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Part of me is
attached to the old

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:52.662 align:middle line:84%
and at some level I feel
like I'm leaving them behind.

00:36:52.662 --> 00:36:55.120 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, I know that
hanging on to that connection

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.580 align:middle line:90%
is not good for me.

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.810 align:middle line:84%
So can you talk to me a little
bit about that ease, and flow,

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:00.785 align:middle line:90%
and joy?

00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And it may be not so much
of a transition, but just

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:07.360 align:middle line:84%
the intention of trusting that
everything is as it should be,

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.000 align:middle line:84%
and listening to the moment,
and moving forward, and aligning

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.059 align:middle line:90%
to the new soul family.

00:37:12.059 --> 00:37:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Align to
the new soul family.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.290 align:middle line:84%
However, there's
grief in your heart.

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
doing what we're doing.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: For you are
grieving the change.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:26.130 align:middle line:10%
And necessary losses in life,
there is always grieving.

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Moving out of a
job into a new one

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.760 align:middle line:84%
is oftentimes grieving
what could have been,

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.740 align:middle line:84%
the fantasy of what
could have been.

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:40.930 align:middle line:84%
But also, a sense that you're
leaving behind many things

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:41.820 align:middle line:90%
of experience.

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.280 align:middle line:90%
You carry those forward.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You're not
leaving them behind.

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.410 align:middle line:90%
They are a part of you, always.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:52.500 align:middle line:90%


00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.870 align:middle line:10%
There's great love in that.

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:57.282 align:middle line:84%
So there's some authenticity
in this separation

00:37:57.282 --> 00:38:00.572 align:middle line:84%
that is occurring from the
past to the new life that

00:38:00.572 --> 00:38:01.601 align:middle line:90%
is emerging.

00:38:01.601 --> 00:38:04.490 align:middle line:90%


00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And we feel this push-pull of
the exhilaration of the new

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.180 align:middle line:90%
and the sadness of the past.

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:14.980 align:middle line:90%


00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:18.460 align:middle line:84%
You're merging into
the new, as we speak.

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:20.080 align:middle line:90%
Before the end of the year.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.380 align:middle line:90%
It's already begun.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:27.670 align:middle line:84%
The trajectory of that
is heightened momentum.

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Great.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Using your consciousness
and your communication

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.220 align:middle line:90%
in the release of the past.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Relationships are
not ending, they're

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:42.790 align:middle line:84%
metamorphosing into other
things with the blessing

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:48.750 align:middle line:84%
of the learning that has
been for all involved.

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:51.050 align:middle line:84%
The learning is
never only been one.

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Each has been a part
of the experience,

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:55.731 align:middle line:90%
and that has been blessed.

00:38:55.731 --> 00:38:56.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Even the difficulties
and the resistances

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:05.961 align:middle line:84%
have been challenging,
but good for worth.

00:39:05.961 --> 00:39:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: That's where
you learn most.

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:12.524 align:middle line:84%
So acknowledge the
sacredness in that.

00:39:12.524 --> 00:39:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Even though
there is contention.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And I'm finding,
as you talk about the grief--

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:22.040 align:middle line:84%
that the moment you spoke
about that, somehow the grief

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.640 align:middle line:90%
was dominating.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And the next feeling
that flowed in

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.500 align:middle line:84%
was the joy of
connecting with the new.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.070 align:middle line:84%
There's not been
very much of that.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.970 align:middle line:10%
So what you're
doing is releasing.

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:36.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's all right to grieve.

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:37.820 align:middle line:90%
It's appropriate to do so.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:41.770 align:middle line:84%
To hold it in would
only make it larger.

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Even for a guy?

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.016 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Particularly for a guy.

00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:46.522 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:46.522 --> 00:39:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Especially.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:47.979 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:47.979 --> 00:39:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Because there is appropriate
emotions that can be shown,

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.670 align:middle line:90%
and others that cannot.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Because you must
be stoic no longer.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.380 align:middle line:10%
It is important, in
the human lifetime,

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:14.910 align:middle line:10%
to accept and access all of
those emotions for health.

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:17.750 align:middle line:84%
For that which is repressed
will only bring imbalance

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:20.360 align:middle line:90%
to your physical body.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.440 align:middle line:90%
Write down what you're feeling.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Get it out of your body, and
that can be shared later,

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:27.560 align:middle line:90%
when it's appropriate.

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.304 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:40:28.304 --> 00:40:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Those feelings-- which
is called conscious separation.

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Each have their own feelings
and it will be accepted later.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.670 align:middle line:90%
There is resistance now.

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:45.180 align:middle line:90%


00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:48.780 align:middle line:90%
A lot of resistance.

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.910 align:middle line:90%
And that's a sadness, yes?

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:53.412 align:middle line:84%
You want friendship,
and ease, and harmony.

00:40:53.412 --> 00:40:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely, yeah.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:55.786 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Not going to happen.

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:58.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nice to have
a heads-up on that.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:03.926 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: So accept what is now.

00:41:03.926 --> 00:41:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Accept that resistance.

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:12.990 align:middle line:10%
Know it's there, it's not going
to be forever, and continue

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:15.660 align:middle line:10%
to hold the love.

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're moving into this
greater expanse of who you are.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.440 align:middle line:90%
No beings.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:26.360 align:middle line:10%
Your life expectancy is 120.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:30.290 align:middle line:90%
You're a different person.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:34.420 align:middle line:10%
When life expectancy
was 40 years old,

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:38.220 align:middle line:10%
it had a certain time frame
in which you lived your life,

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:41.760 align:middle line:10%
and then you died, and
started new and fresh.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.630 align:middle line:84%
You're starting new and
fresh in the same body.

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:45.160 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I felt that.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: So it is not to have
conflict with the change.

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:58.070 align:middle line:84%
It is a death and
birth in the same body.

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:00.910 align:middle line:84%
When we speak of
birth to birth, you're

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:05.100 align:middle line:84%
birthing into a new way
of being for yourself.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:08.420 align:middle line:84%
You're shedding the
skin of the old self.

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:12.000 align:middle line:84%
The snake that sheds the
skin into the fresh, new skin

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.360 align:middle line:84%
does not say, oh, I
need that skin back.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:17.730 align:middle line:90%
They are happy to be free of it.

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:18.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And can breathe
better, and live better.

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you're
experiencing now.

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:30.605 align:middle line:84%
So you're in this
in-between stage.

00:42:30.605 --> 00:42:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And out of this chaos
will come order.

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:36.050 align:middle line:90%


00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:38.606 align:middle line:84%
The end of the year
is not that far away

00:42:38.606 --> 00:42:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You've been
in it for a time.

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:41.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:42.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm hm.

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:46.171 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Just imagine
what 2015 will be.

00:42:46.171 --> 00:42:46.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It's not without
challenge or conflict.

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:53.637 align:middle line:84%
It's how you meet it
that will be different.

00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So the
tension and the tightness

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:57.580 align:middle line:84%
has been related
to the resistance.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That feeling.

00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:59.289 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:59.289 --> 00:43:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Because I continually
have the feeling that,

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:04.490 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of this,
and simultaneous with this,

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:08.220 align:middle line:84%
is that sense of presence--
of still ease and flow.

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Even though it's a difficulty.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And what's kind of blocked
that up is me being resistant.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Resistance
to the emotion.

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:16.242 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:16.242 --> 00:43:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: A journalistic form
of writing would be excellent.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Even one sentence can free you.

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:23.980 align:middle line:90%
It's cathartic.

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Meditate.

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:28.250 align:middle line:84%
It will give you the
clarity you need.

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:31.114 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: There is an asking?

00:43:31.114 --> 00:43:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's it.

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.865 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:43:32.865 --> 00:43:35.774 align:middle line:90%


00:43:35.774 --> 00:43:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Theo, I
have a quick question,

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.510 align:middle line:84%
before we go to the next person,
that is maybe a little more

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:47.270 align:middle line:84%
functional about the process of
leaving a body through our exit

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:50.120 align:middle line:84%
or birth/death, and
then coming back in.

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And I know, in some of
the ancient traditions,

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:59.090 align:middle line:84%
they say that often the time and
date roughly that a soul leaves

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:02.460 align:middle line:84%
the body, in another
incarnation they

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:06.480 align:middle line:84%
may come back at roughly that
same time or that same date.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.500 align:middle line:90%
Is there truth in that?

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:11.311 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It's possible,
and it has occurred.

00:44:11.311 --> 00:44:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And there are many who depart
a body on their birth date,

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.070 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Not always, but it has happened
in a number of circumstances.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So it is birth to
birth, you see.

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:28.864 align:middle line:84%
We prefer to speak of birth
to birth, than death to birth.

00:44:28.864 --> 00:44:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's a
somewhat common phenomenon

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:36.140 align:middle line:84%
to be born/die
into a new reality,

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and then be born into
the physical reality

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.830 align:middle line:90%
on that same frequency.

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.050 align:middle line:90%
Or a higher one.

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:46.830 align:middle line:84%
In this case, of the
fifth dimensionary energy,

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:51.310 align:middle line:84%
those coming in embodied now
are coming in, in this higher

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:54.040 align:middle line:90%
frequency, you see.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Not the lower one,
which they left.

00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:00.620 align:middle line:84%
But they still have the
resonance, on a soul level,

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:04.470 align:middle line:90%
to all of their experiences.

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
might necessitate

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.150 align:middle line:84%
choosing a different
kind of date, time,

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:09.490 align:middle line:90%
and imprint, and all.

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:10.269 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:45:10.269 --> 00:45:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: It also
brings up the question, Theo,

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.020 align:middle line:84%
of how would you
differentiate between an older

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:17.650 align:middle line:90%
soul and a younger soul?

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Life
experience, embodiments.

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And we speak of these
delineations of age only

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:29.710 align:middle line:90%
in the human experience.

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Because it is attached
to emotional learning.

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:35.730 align:middle line:90%


00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I think,
Marcus, we can still

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:39.930 align:middle line:90%
take one or two more people.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:41.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm keeping an eye on the clock.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.356 align:middle line:90%
So, Theo--

00:45:44.356 --> 00:45:47.049 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
That time thing.

00:45:47.049 --> 00:45:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Your linear time.

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:48.673 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:48.673 --> 00:45:50.040 align:middle line:90%
Our linear time thing.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:53.200 align:middle line:90%
We are prisoners to this.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.968 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Oh, but you are not.

00:45:54.968 --> 00:45:56.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:57.191 align:middle line:90%
This one.

00:45:57.191 --> 00:45:59.720 align:middle line:90%


00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Good.

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.803 align:middle line:90%
We're getting the guys in.

00:46:01.803 --> 00:46:03.069 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:46:03.069 --> 00:46:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Guys usually don't
raise their hands.

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:05.860 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you
for this opportunity.

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: He did not raise--

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:08.165 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: He
didn't raise his hand.

00:46:08.165 --> 00:46:08.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I say
they usually don't.

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:11.730 align:middle line:90%
So it's good he's calling them.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I lost my mom
about, actually, a year ago--

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:15.510 align:middle line:90%
last October.

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And when my father passed, a
number of years prior to that,

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:23.320 align:middle line:84%
I never felt that he
was judging my life.

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.790 align:middle line:84%
I now feel that I must have
had a different relationship

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:26.340 align:middle line:90%
with my mom.

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's times
where I feel at peace

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:30.910 align:middle line:84%
with that-- once they're
on the other side,

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:33.040 align:middle line:84%
there is no judgment--
the way I perceive it.

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.650 align:middle line:84%
At times, I still
feel like she's

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:39.440 align:middle line:84%
the mother looking down and
saying, good job, or bad job.

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:40.970 align:middle line:90%
Maybe more bad job, even.

00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And when we cross over--
I guess my question

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.320 align:middle line:90%
is, is judgment really gone?

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.610 align:middle line:90%
Is there no longer judgment?

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:52.091 align:middle line:84%
Are they all-knowing,
suddenly, on the other side?

00:46:52.091 --> 00:46:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Or why would they
have to come back?

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Why would we need to come
back and reincarnate again?

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:56.760 align:middle line:90%
If once we got there--

00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Because you like this
experience, believe it or not.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:04.490 align:middle line:84%
The earthly plane is an
exquisite opportunity

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:06.590 align:middle line:90%
of grand growth.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:09.840 align:middle line:10%
And as to your mother--
she's not judging you.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.990 align:middle line:10%
It is your perception
of her judgment

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:17.490 align:middle line:10%
when she was living,
where she judged a lot.

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:22.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not only you,
but everybody else.

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:25.430 align:middle line:84%
That stemmed from her own
insecurity and lack of love

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:27.010 align:middle line:90%
for herself.

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And on some level,
you were aware that.

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:34.200 align:middle line:90%


00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.390 align:middle line:90%
But it hurt the small child.

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:39.610 align:middle line:90%
For you desired her love.

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:42.760 align:middle line:84%
You felt the love
from your father.

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And when he was gone, that
was a great loss to you.

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:52.622 align:middle line:84%
For it was-- he stood
between you and your mother.

00:47:52.622 --> 00:47:54.070 align:middle line:90%
He supported you.

00:47:54.070 --> 00:48:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And when that was gone, there
was a bunch of fear about, oh,

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:03.010 align:middle line:90%
what I'm going to do now?

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:07.360 align:middle line:90%
There is no shield.

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.470 align:middle line:84%
She's not judging
you any longer.

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:12.780 align:middle line:84%
She wishes you to know that
she loves you very much.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.470 align:middle line:90%
She did not know how to love.

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:17.200 align:middle line:90%
She did not love herself.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.700 align:middle line:84%
So she was always comparing
herself to others,

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:23.030 align:middle line:90%
and how she should be.

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:25.970 align:middle line:90%
Not how she should feel.

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So she reacted from her
intellect, not her heart.

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And the what of others,
what would they think.

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:38.490 align:middle line:90%


00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:42.570 align:middle line:84%
So she does know more
now than she did then.

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And she's not
judging you at all.

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:48.280 align:middle line:84%
She thinks you're
quite magnificent.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.974 align:middle line:90%
You should've judged her more.

00:48:50.974 --> 00:48:58.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:02.090 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to
release all of that,

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and know the beauty and
uniqueness that you are.

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And the loving and the
integrating on a soul

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:09.760 align:middle line:90%
level yourself.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:14.390 align:middle line:84%
You are the best parent
for that little boy

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:17.010 align:middle line:90%
that has always felt judged.

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:22.970 align:middle line:84%
So you go in on the inner
planes and call him forth.

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:26.950 align:middle line:84%
You will be aware of an
age in which he first

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:29.780 align:middle line:90%
felt abandoned by her.

00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:34.260 align:middle line:84%
As we speak, an age already
comes to mind, doesn't it?

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Begin there.

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:37.200 align:middle line:90%
Speak with him.

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.430 align:middle line:90%
Parent him.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:41.380 align:middle line:84%
The higher, whole
self that you are now,

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:45.540 align:middle line:84%
the adult that you are now
can nurture him, support him,

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:50.700 align:middle line:84%
let him know he has a voice,
and you will take care of him.

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:53.780 align:middle line:90%
And he can play.

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.395 align:middle line:84%
And he can yell, and
scream, and jump around,

00:49:56.395 --> 00:49:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and do all of the
things that were

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:02.070 align:middle line:90%
inappropriate in your home.

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: This is freeing.

00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, indeed.

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And this is a part
that has only begun here,

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:13.660 align:middle line:90%
energetically.

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Stay with this for the hours
and the days that it needs.

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.415 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: There
are times where

00:50:18.415 --> 00:50:21.800 align:middle line:84%
I feel I have completed
what you're talking about,

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.680 align:middle line:90%
and that I've done the work.

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:27.259 align:middle line:84%
And then, it's a new wave, or a
new level, seems to take over.

00:50:27.259 --> 00:50:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And I've thought, you're
done with this, already.

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Different
lineages, you see.

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:35.186 align:middle line:84%
Because of the literal set, at
a very young age, about who you

00:50:35.186 --> 00:50:38.760 align:middle line:90%
are for survival's sake.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.820 align:middle line:84%
But as you matured, there
were different levels

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:46.780 align:middle line:84%
of situations,
circumstances that occurred,

00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:49.680 align:middle line:90%
that reaffirmed that belief.

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:53.030 align:middle line:10%
Or your mother
reaffirmed it for you.

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So what you're doing,
like a string of pearls,

00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:01.910 align:middle line:84%
discovering at each age,
and reframing, re-parenting,

00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and soothing those
parts of self.

00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That makes sense.

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: The two-year old, the
five-year old, the 12-year old,

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:15.320 align:middle line:84%
the 16-year-old,
all of the lineage.

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So what you're doing is
adjusting and calling them

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.820 align:middle line:90%
all home.

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:24.063 align:middle line:84%
So that is why you're
seeing them showing up

00:51:24.063 --> 00:51:25.890 align:middle line:90%
at different times.

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:27.472 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same one.

00:51:27.472 --> 00:51:31.400 align:middle line:90%


00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.346 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:34.346 --> 00:51:36.820 align:middle line:90%
Freeing.

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.682 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Another question?

00:51:38.682 --> 00:51:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
Do we have time?

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:41.015 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm good.

00:51:41.015 --> 00:51:42.012 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:51:42.012 --> 00:51:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Thank you.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think,
Theo, if you choose

00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:49.840 align:middle line:84%
to identify someone
else, we have

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:53.280 align:middle line:84%
a short window of about-- in
our Earth time-- about five

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.200 align:middle line:90%
minutes here.

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.760 align:middle line:84%
If you want to look around and
choose someone to speak with,

00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.652 align:middle line:90%
this will be our last question.

00:51:59.652 --> 00:52:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: We hear
all your questions.

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:05.875 align:middle line:84%
But this one-- is
a bit resistance.

00:52:05.875 --> 00:52:09.046 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:09.046 --> 00:52:15.287 align:middle line:90%


00:52:15.287 --> 00:52:17.120 align:middle line:84%
It's good that you
haven't thought about it.

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So you have something
to tell me, then?

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:25.569 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You're moving in
quite a strong direction now.

00:52:25.569 --> 00:52:27.110 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go over
the past, but you're

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:30.102 align:middle line:90%
afraid to step in to the new.

00:52:30.102 --> 00:52:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's scary.

00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Of course it is.

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:33.988 align:middle line:84%
We can see it in
your countenance.

00:52:33.988 --> 00:52:36.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:38.430 align:middle line:90%
What if I change this?

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:41.950 align:middle line:84%
What if this doesn't
work, over here?

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:44.280 align:middle line:90%
Make the decision.

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.530 align:middle line:84%
In the decision the
universal energies

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:50.090 align:middle line:90%
align with it to make it so.

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:53.890 align:middle line:90%
Do not negate that it cannot be.

00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:56.280 align:middle line:90%
You have the power to do it.

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:58.380 align:middle line:90%
You have the knowledge.

00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:01.016 align:middle line:90%
You have the wisdom within you.

00:53:01.016 --> 00:53:03.950 align:middle line:90%
You have the strength.

00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:06.030 align:middle line:90%
And you're ready.

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:08.340 align:middle line:90%
You're ready now.

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:09.240 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid.

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Easier said than done.

00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:14.610 align:middle line:84%
But address who, inside
of you, is afraid.

00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:18.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not the adult,
accomplished self that you are.

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:20.750 align:middle line:84%
You're very
accomplished and bright.

00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:23.110 align:middle line:90%
You have much knowledge.

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:25.640 align:middle line:84%
It is a little aspect
inside of you that says,

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:28.682 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this alone.

00:53:28.682 --> 00:53:31.140 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I feel like I've
been working with that aspect,

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:32.181 align:middle line:90%
and I make some progress.

00:53:32.181 --> 00:53:34.860 align:middle line:90%
And then I don't.

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:36.470 align:middle line:90%
And then I step backward.

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:38.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'm stuck again.

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:40.075 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Keep talking to them.

00:53:40.075 --> 00:53:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Say, I will
do the hard stuff.

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:44.220 align:middle line:90%
We're doing it together.

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:48.200 align:middle line:84%
We're going forward into
this new life together.

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.700 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to have
to handle this by yourself.

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm in.

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:53.640 align:middle line:90%
I have the knowledge.

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.620 align:middle line:90%
I have the wisdom.

00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:56.365 align:middle line:90%
I'm helping you.

00:53:56.365 --> 00:53:57.010 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:53:57.010 --> 00:54:00.070 align:middle line:90%


00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:04.090 align:middle line:84%
You're letting go
of a great past.

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Just like the other
we just spoke to.

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: And breathe through it.

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And you're
feeling the acceleration

00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:16.090 align:middle line:90%
of it moving very quickly.

00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And you're wanting to stop
and put the brakes on,

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:20.090 align:middle line:90%
because it's coming.

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It is.

00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: So daily, be in the
moment-to-moment experience,

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.220 align:middle line:90%
not in the future.

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Because when you
get into the fear state,

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.090 align:middle line:90%
it's when you're in the future.

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:34.430 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
resolve the future.

00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Just it's the steps of the
now that are important.

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's all
unfolding perfectly,

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and you will be quite pleased
with what is occurring.

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I already am.

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: There you have it.

00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Stay in that pleasure.

00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:54.345 align:middle line:84%
For if you're too
far into the past,

00:54:54.345 --> 00:54:57.575 align:middle line:84%
you're in recrimination
of the-- and the what

00:54:57.575 --> 00:55:02.300 align:middle line:84%
ifs-- of the history of the
past to dictate the now.

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:03.944 align:middle line:90%
That's done.

00:55:03.944 --> 00:55:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: That is only feedback
from your life experience,

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.950 align:middle line:84%
that you choose the strength
to move forward now,

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:14.141 align:middle line:90%
not encumbering you.

00:55:14.141 --> 00:55:14.640 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:18.390 align:middle line:90%


00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:20.550 align:middle line:90%
Breathe into it daily.

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Breathe and envision yourself.

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.860 align:middle line:90%
Call your future self forward.

00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:29.680 align:middle line:90%
Become her.

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:30.970 align:middle line:90%
She's accomplished it.

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:33.300 align:middle line:84%
You're already there,
you're living it.

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:36.792 align:middle line:90%
Bring her in to calm that fear.

00:55:36.792 --> 00:55:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:40.488 align:middle line:90%
It's all exciting.

00:55:40.488 --> 00:55:41.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Some
final thoughts for us, Theo?

00:55:44.110 --> 00:55:46.815 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: This is the
grand change of time.

00:55:46.815 --> 00:55:51.800 align:middle line:84%
This energy that is
swirling about all of you

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.930 align:middle line:90%
is heightened vibration change.

00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:58.260 align:middle line:90%
The old patterns do not work.

00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.820 align:middle line:90%
The new are formed.

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:04.340 align:middle line:90%
The old paradigms are not.

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:06.646 align:middle line:90%
The new has been formed.

00:56:06.646 --> 00:56:09.320 align:middle line:90%
They're dissolving, as we speak.

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:15.935 align:middle line:84%
So you may feel that you are
on a slippery slope, at times.

00:56:15.935 --> 00:56:20.360 align:middle line:90%


00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:23.022 align:middle line:84%
Put on your slippery
shoes and ride it out.

00:56:23.022 --> 00:56:25.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:27.265 align:middle line:84%
For it will be quite
the ride, and enjoyable.

00:56:27.265 --> 00:56:29.780 align:middle line:90%


00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:31.610 align:middle line:84%
It is time for it,
and you have chosen.

00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:34.780 align:middle line:90%


00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You are complete
with your asking?

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.243 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: We are.

00:56:38.243 --> 00:56:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
very much, Theo.

00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: We assist your
path that is the asking.

00:56:42.110 --> 00:56:43.720 align:middle line:90%
And it is given.

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:46.090 align:middle line:90%
It is continuous.

00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:47.806 align:middle line:90%
God's love unto you.

00:56:47.806 --> 00:56:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
And you, Theo.

00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Good day.

00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Good day.

00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:54.510 align:middle line:90%


00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So Sheila will be
back with us in just a moment,

00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:58.867 align:middle line:90%
and-- hello.

00:56:58.867 --> 00:57:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: There she is.

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so how are
you doing with all this?

00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:03.300 align:middle line:90%
Was it good?

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:04.753 align:middle line:90%
Was it good for you?

00:57:04.753 --> 00:57:07.327 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:07.327 --> 00:57:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: Yeah, it was.

00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:12.967 align:middle line:84%
It takes me a minute to kind of
get in the spot, and get clear.

00:57:12.967 --> 00:57:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one thing
you notice is that--

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure, if
everyone was called on,

00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:19.470 align:middle line:84%
we'd all have that
kind of pain trapped,

00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:21.930 align:middle line:84%
from the old patterns
that are dissolving.

00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Particularly with, I think,
DNA genetic family, often.

00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:29.740 align:middle line:84%
More so than our soul families
that we've kept together.

00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: That's
where the highest learning is.

00:57:31.050 --> 00:57:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Absolutely.

00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:34.466 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any final
thoughts from you, Marcus?

00:57:34.466 --> 00:57:36.220 align:middle line:84%
We just have a
minute or so left.

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Well,
thank you all, obviously,

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:39.903 align:middle line:84%
for your vulnerability and
for being here with us.

00:57:39.903 --> 00:57:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And I told Sheila
this yesterday.

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I learn so much
every time I sit here

00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:48.590 align:middle line:84%
with Theo and with our
group that gathers.

00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:50.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's just remarkable.

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:50.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a real gift.

00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:53.098 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
questions that were asked

00:57:53.098 --> 00:57:55.260 align:middle line:84%
are applicable to virtually
everybody watching

00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:56.590 align:middle line:90%
this right now.

00:57:56.590 --> 00:57:57.570 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:57:57.570 --> 00:57:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: Wonderful.

00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're all in this
together, aren't we?

00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are.

00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:01.993 align:middle line:10%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE:
We're all doing it.

00:58:01.993 --> 00:58:03.240 align:middle line:10%
I'm doing it.

00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.220 align:middle line:10%
We all are doing it.

00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And someone brought
everybody here together today.

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: Well, I tend
to believe Theo brought us.

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.346 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A little
help from my friends.

00:58:10.346 --> 00:58:11.430 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE:
They told me years ago

00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:16.407 align:middle line:84%
that-- you know, it's
like you throw a party,

00:58:16.407 --> 00:58:17.990 align:middle line:84%
you don't know who's
going to show up.

00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:20.180 align:middle line:90%
Or you hope people will show up.

00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was real nervous
about an event.

00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:26.170 align:middle line:10%
And they said, take no
thought for who is coming.

00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:27.922 align:middle line:90%
For we are directing them.

00:58:27.922 --> 00:58:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: So then
I went, oh, thank goodness.

00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:32.429 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:32.429 --> 00:58:34.095 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's off
your shoulders, mine,

00:58:34.095 --> 00:58:36.090 align:middle line:90%
and everybody else's here, OK?

00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:37.280 align:middle line:90%
There was no choice.

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.862 align:middle line:84%
On that note, we're going to be
picking up in a little while,

00:58:39.862 --> 00:58:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
do another show.

00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.787 align:middle line:84%
And this one is going to be
on soul integration, which--

00:58:43.787 --> 00:58:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Theo
started to get into.

00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She started.

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:46.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:47.740 align:middle line:90%
I heard just a little bit of it.

00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because all these questions

00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:52.579 align:middle line:84%
asked are all pieces
of that larger process.

00:58:52.579 --> 00:58:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: It is.

00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So until
next time, thank you

00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:58.420 align:middle line:90%
for joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:03.100 align:middle line:90%
