>>REGINA MEREDITH: I would guess
that each of you watching this

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.980 align:middle line:84%
has experienced a place that
feels different, somehow sacred.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Some of you have even made a
point to travel to these places

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.070 align:middle line:84%
to see what you may have
access to within yourself.

Freddy Silva has spent
his entire lifetime

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:10%
studying and experiencing
these sacred sites,

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.380 align:middle line:10%
and he's here to tell us
how they do what they do.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Freddy, it's good to
have you back again.

a period of time.

these we've done together.

I've got a tent outside.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.925 align:middle line:90%
It's very practical.

>>REGINA: That's
how you're doing it.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.390 align:middle line:90%

You know what?

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.010 align:middle line:84%
In all these interviews, I have
never asked you a very simple

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.720 align:middle line:84%
question, which is, how
did you originally--

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.800 align:middle line:84%
what inspired you to
become so dedicated--

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:84%
some might even say
obsessed-- with going

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.287 align:middle line:84%
to all these sacred
spots in the world?

00:01:07.287 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It is an
obsession, isn't it?

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.162 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it seems to be.

00:01:10.162 --> 00:01:11.745 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've read
all your books.

00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, you're the one.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.050 align:middle line:10%
I think it's because it is an
obsession, because it was really

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:10%
to do with being
an inquiring mind

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.597 align:middle line:10%
and seeing what's
this all about?

00:01:21.597 --> 00:01:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's the worst
question that you

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.610 align:middle line:84%
could ask of a sacred space,
because when you tell that

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:84%
to a sacred space, it
says, well, let's show you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.220 align:middle line:90%
what this is all about.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's a never-ending
cycle of experience.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.672 align:middle line:84%
So one experience
leads to the other.

00:01:33.672 --> 00:01:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And then you want to find
out, why is this happening?

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you go off
and research it.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.530 align:middle line:10%
And it's all there, of course,
in musty tomes and things.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.507 align:middle line:10%
But one experience goes
to another experience,

00:01:42.507 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:10%
which goes to another one.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.070 align:middle line:90%
And there's no end of discovery.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I began
to do it, because I

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.840 align:middle line:84%
felt that there
was something here

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.437 align:middle line:84%
that was of benefit, not just
for me, but for other people.

00:01:50.437 --> 00:01:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But something
had to get you on the path

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.340 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody goes
to sacred sites.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.845 align:middle line:84%
What got you out
there the first time?

00:01:57.845 --> 00:01:58.897 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, big rocks.

00:01:58.897 --> 00:01:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big rocks.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.460 align:middle line:90%
That's all I needed to know.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I wanted
to be a rock star.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.240 align:middle line:84%
It's just that I had my mind
with guitars and big hair.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.040 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Got to be
more clear about that.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I know.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.229 align:middle line:90%
But it really was.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.740 align:middle line:84%
It was about the
experience of interacting

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.210 align:middle line:84%
with places where I thought,
OK, it's all very physical.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.550 align:middle line:90%
But it's actually not.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.003 align:middle line:84%
There's a world
between the worlds

00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:19.170 align:middle line:90%
when you go to these places.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was the fact that I
began to interact and see

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.770 align:middle line:84%
the entities that were there,
which I didn't even know

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.860 align:middle line:90%
was even possible.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:10%
So for me, it was like I was
a skeptic, although I really

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.767 align:middle line:10%
believed in the concept
of sacred space.

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I was drawing pyramids when
I was three, for god's sake.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, god.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I didn't
belong with other kids.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's your key.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.490 align:middle line:84%
That's the sign I was
looking for, drawing pyramids

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.700 align:middle line:90%
by three years old.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And you have a steep
history in Egyptology,

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and I would even venture to
say, past lives in Egypt.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:90%
And it goes further--

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.743 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Maybe one or two.

00:02:51.743 --> 00:02:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --I think, more
than that, beyond that, even.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.060 align:middle line:90%
So you came in with a destiny.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.530 align:middle line:90%
All right, so we've got that.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk
about-- let's go

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.670 align:middle line:84%
down to the basics
of what a portal is,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.725 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people kind
of confuse it with other things

00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:07.525 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:03:07.525 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I know.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important to
clarify because the word begins

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.728 align:middle line:84%
to take on all kinds
of dimensions which

00:03:12.728 --> 00:03:14.020 align:middle line:90%
have no resemblance to reality.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.213 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Which is
kind of ironic.

00:03:16.213 --> 00:03:18.380 align:middle line:84%
No, I mean, a portal
essentially is a place on Earth

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:84%
where the laws of
physics as we know

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.350 align:middle line:90%
them behave very differently.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's about the manipulation
of electromagnetism, of sound,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.160 align:middle line:90%
of gravity.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And it allows you, under certain
conditions-- for a minute

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:84%
or for a lifetime-- to travel
through time and space.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.983 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not just talking
about metaphysically.

00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about also
physically in some locations.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Like in Peru-- and
locals know about people

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.920 align:middle line:84%
that go into these
doorways which

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.290 align:middle line:84%
are shaped like a T that are
carved on the sides of hills.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.540 align:middle line:90%
People physically disappear.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.347 align:middle line:84%
And they come out
looking very dazed.

00:03:49.347 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:90%
And I've met some of them.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.750 align:middle line:90%
And you can't fake this stuff.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.830 align:middle line:90%
You can't fake fear.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because that's
what-- they come back

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.990 align:middle line:84%
looking like they've stumbled
upon something that they can't

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.800 align:middle line:90%
explain.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.340 align:middle line:90%
But yet, it's very beneficial.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Once it sinks in,
it's very beneficial.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.040 align:middle line:84%
So they're opening
up these portals

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.540 align:middle line:84%
along the face of the Earth
where unusual things happen.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And the Hopi have a lovely way
of describing it, of all people.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.070 align:middle line:90%
It's in their creation myth.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And they said in the beginning,
when the creator made the Earth,

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:84%
he sends a person down
to the South Pole--

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.350 align:middle line:84%
not the North Pole,
the South Pole--

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.207 align:middle line:84%
with a drum, which
is exactly what

00:04:20.207 --> 00:04:21.415 align:middle line:90%
you'd take to the South Pole.

00:04:21.415 --> 00:04:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And he sits there
listening to the heartbeat

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:24.840 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth Mother.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I can beat
the rhythm to that beat.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And he gets a sort of a
beat going on this drum.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's a sympathetic
resonance between the two.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And they said at that
moment, the Earth

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.290 align:middle line:90%
becomes abundant with energy.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And it sends these life
streams to the surface.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth becomes
abundant with life.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.310 align:middle line:84%
But some places on
the Earth's surface

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.630 align:middle line:84%
became more abundant with
this energy than the others.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And they called them
the spots of the faun.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lovely way to
describe this sort of places

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:84%
where unusual things
happen to people.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
they'll be the places

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.540 align:middle line:84%
where shamans would
go to get information

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.450 align:middle line:84%
or where people would
sit for a good time

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and leave their body for
a little bit, come back

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.440 align:middle line:84%
with information for
the good of the tribe

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.400 align:middle line:84%
or for their own
spiritual development.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.853 align:middle line:90%
Either way, it's correct.

00:05:06.853 --> 00:05:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was all to
do with the fact

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
that you're basically
giving yourself

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.310 align:middle line:84%
some extra tools in which to
navigate the physical world.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that's
very important right now.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.075 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is indeed.

00:05:17.075 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Right now, it looks
like pure chaos.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So you're able to move beyond
time and space, the notions

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.180 align:middle line:84%
of time and space, when you are
interacting with these portals.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:90%
And I want to ask you this.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that they were
inherent to the natural creation

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.310 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth itself?

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think that there were
helping hands in certain places

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:90%
from--

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.840 align:middle line:84%
there's so many
different species

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.490 align:middle line:84%
that interacted with Earth
during its formation.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there was
maybe some help by others?

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Influence?

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I think it's both, because
I mean, the Earth itself

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.460 align:middle line:90%
is an organism.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.340 align:middle line:84%
It creates its own
little hotspots

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.590 align:middle line:90%
in order to calibrate itself.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:10%
It's like acupuncture
points in the human body.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:58.570 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.243 align:middle line:84%
But also, from my interaction--
and after 30 years

00:06:01.243 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:84%
of doing this and knowing that
you can actually physically

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:84%
move the energy using
your god-given intent.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
experiments at Princeton

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.880 align:middle line:84%
to prove the power of group
intention in order just

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.950 align:middle line:84%
to move the drumbeat
of a computer, which

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.810 align:middle line:84%
is one of the best
stories I've ever heard.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually, using
your right intention,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.360 align:middle line:84%
move energy from
one spot to the next

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and then anchor it, which
brings us back, of course,

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.080 align:middle line:90%
to those large big rocks.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the metal and the
iron and the quartz

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.030 align:middle line:84%
in the rock that makes sure
that the energy doesn't move.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.610 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes a
place not just where

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.780 align:middle line:84%
the Earth breathes and creates
its own particular movement

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.580 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.900 align:middle line:84%
It's also a place where other
forms throughout the universe,

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.440 align:middle line:84%
at different levels
of frequency,

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.620 align:middle line:84%
can use these portals as a
way to come in and say, hey,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:90%
what's Earth all about?

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even continue
using or manipulating--

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean in a
bad word-- them,

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:84%
whether it's to slightly move
the location for some better

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.357 align:middle line:84%
effect, they can do that
for themselves and others.

00:06:56.357 --> 00:06:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And we found that when we
were researching the real crop

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:00.730 align:middle line:90%
circles.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Not the man-made
stuff that came later,

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.890 align:middle line:84%
but in the original
research, it was quite clear

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.770 align:middle line:84%
that they were also
creating these new hotspots

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.170 align:middle line:84%
on the face of the Earth,
which would then interact

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.460 align:middle line:84%
with the local currents
of the landscape,

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.620 align:middle line:84%
the telluric currents,
as science calls them.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.808 align:middle line:84%
And they would interact
in terms of energy

00:07:17.808 --> 00:07:18.975 align:middle line:90%
with the local sacred sites.

00:07:18.975 --> 00:07:21.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if the sites
have been used, abused,

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.840 align:middle line:90%
and shut down, in many cases.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.950 align:middle line:90%
The crop circle appears.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:25.750 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.280 align:middle line:84%
It establishes a
new energy field.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And then people start going
to the new sacred space

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and having their
own experiences,

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.570 align:middle line:84%
just as they would, say, in a
dolmen or in a giant's grave

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.660 align:middle line:90%
or in a pyramid.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So there is a
certain movement now

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.780 align:middle line:84%
where the Earth is
shifting in its own skin.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course, would
bring a new movement of energy

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.100 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:90%
The old sites are still there.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
maintained by our devotion

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:84%
to them, because you leave a
little drop of your own light

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.640 align:middle line:90%
at these places.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's like watering a plant.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.820 align:middle line:84%
The site and the
spirit of the place

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.840 align:middle line:84%
says, well, thank you
for remembering me.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.670 align:middle line:90%
And it rejuvenates the site.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.290 align:middle line:84%
I remember going to the
pyramid of Giza during COVID.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.790 align:middle line:84%
We were the only people in the
country, which was wonderful.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.633 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And I could literally
hear the building looking at me

00:08:07.633 --> 00:08:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and going, oh, thank
god there's no tourists.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for coming
and honoring me.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:90%
I said, it's not a problem.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.270 align:middle line:90%
And it was.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.770 align:middle line:84%
You could actually
hear the building

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:16.850 align:middle line:90%
breathe a sigh of relief.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And it felt so good
being in there.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So there are new places
being born all the time

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.535 align:middle line:84%
because the Earth and the
universe is a living organism.

00:08:23.535 --> 00:08:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this might be
a little tangential.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And I've told you
about it before.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.590 align:middle line:84%
But in the story of the
origins of the species that I

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.900 align:middle line:84%
was given from my soul
group 40 years ago,

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.539 align:middle line:90%
it coincides with others.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.169 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see pieces
of it in there.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:42.490 align:middle line:84%
But the key thing was they
called the people that were

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.010 align:middle line:84%
indigenous to Earth and
then imbued with that

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:84%
other-dimensional
mind and energy,

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:84%
they called them
"portal people,"

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.550 align:middle line:90%
meaning there had to have been--

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.480 align:middle line:84%
I know it was, as
they explained it,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.440 align:middle line:84%
there was an oddness, a
plasticity between dimensions

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.830 align:middle line:84%
that served as a portal that
allowed beings from another,

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.960 align:middle line:84%
higher dimension of Earth
that already existed

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.330 align:middle line:84%
in their civilization to
come through and merge

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.730 align:middle line:84%
with these physical
bodies that we have

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.250 align:middle line:90%
to experience this physicality.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it be
that these portals

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:84%
might have been what were
accessed for that to happen

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.710 align:middle line:84%
as well in these various
places around the world where

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.335 align:middle line:84%
it was easier for
them to come through?

00:09:22.335 --> 00:09:23.135 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:09:23.135 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:90%
It's an easy way to get in.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit like watching
UFOs going along

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:84%
from A to B along the
landscape following

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:84%
the telluric currents, because
you've got a natural conveyor

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.030 align:middle line:90%
belt right there.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.370 align:middle line:84%
The portal acts
exactly the same way.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a means to an end.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, NASA was very
helpful in this in 2008.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the press release
as though it was yesterday

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
because they used the
words "magnetic portals"

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.550 align:middle line:90%
in the first opening line.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they
said, and I quote,

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.968 align:middle line:84%
"The Earth is linked to the sun
by magnetic portals which open

00:09:50.968 --> 00:09:52.260 align:middle line:90%
and close every eight minutes."

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And where they cross
with the solar wind 1,000 miles

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.750 align:middle line:84%
up above the atmosphere,
they create these X points,

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.550 align:middle line:90%
as they call them.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:01.780 align:middle line:90%
And they go from there.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Information comes from
the Earth to the Sun

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.410 align:middle line:90%
and possibly beyond that.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:84%
But in the Rigveda, they're
already talking about this

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.930 align:middle line:90%
in 8,000 BC.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And they call them the
serpents that glide along

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.990 align:middle line:84%
the ground that are
mirrored in the sky

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.080 align:middle line:90%
with the arrows of sorcerers.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Sorcerer is someone who
works with source energy,

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:90%
the arrow is your intention.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So they already knew
about this back then.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:26.250 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, they're basically using
these wonderful tubes of light

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.290 align:middle line:84%
in order to connect from
A to B. And the Hopi

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.560 align:middle line:90%
did the same thing, too.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.830 align:middle line:84%
If you go into a kiva and you
have the fire pit and you have--

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.840 align:middle line:84%
there's a little hole
next to the fire pit.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Nobody pays attention
to the small details,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:37.920 align:middle line:90%
which is terrible.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.462 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's
the little hole for?

00:10:39.462 --> 00:10:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It's the sipapu reed.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:41.920 align:middle line:90%
It's the reed of heaven.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.867 align:middle line:84%
So whenever the
shaman goes in there

00:10:43.867 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:84%
under the right
circumstances, there's

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.940 align:middle line:84%
a magnetic tube like a spiral
that goes out of the kiva,

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.750 align:middle line:84%
connects to the other world,
allows a shaman's soul to leave,

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.020 align:middle line:84%
and it allows information
to come back in.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.385 align:middle line:90%
You talk about that in Japan.

00:10:57.385 --> 00:10:59.260 align:middle line:84%
You'll say, that's called
the reed of heaven.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:90%
And you go to Persia.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.357 align:middle line:84%
They say, oh yeah, that's
the golden reed to heaven.

00:11:02.357 --> 00:11:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And it only appears
at sacred caves

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.840 align:middle line:84%
on sacred mountains--
no other mountain,

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.510 align:middle line:84%
except for that sacred mountain,
which is why it's sacred.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, they're already
using these A-to-B places

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.290 align:middle line:84%
in order to get from
one place to the other.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.833 align:middle line:84%
So it's only logical to assume
that then other entities can

00:11:18.833 --> 00:11:20.250 align:middle line:84%
also use that to
come here as well

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.110 align:middle line:84%
and have a little taste of
what the Earth is all about.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, in this origin
story, a lot of them came here.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.335 align:middle line:90%
And here we are.

00:11:28.335 --> 00:11:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They found Portuguese
pastries and scotch,

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.710 align:middle line:90%
and they figured, I'm staying.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, those
little egg custard tarts.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:34.800 align:middle line:90%
What do you call that?

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: [PORTUGUESE]

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.920 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.845 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's why
my tour to Portugal --

00:11:40.845 --> 00:11:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why
everybody stays here,

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.240 align:middle line:90%
is for things like that.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Why else be on Earth, right?

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to the
way these portals work,

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.690 align:middle line:84%
because the laws of
physics do not behave

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.770 align:middle line:90%
the same way as elsewhere.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, this is
everyone's divine right

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.140 align:middle line:90%
to interact with these.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.610 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be a
Hopi elder or a shaman.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Any one of us can do it if we
choose to be open, move into it,

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:84%
and literally be
open and without,

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:90%
what do you call it, agenda?

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:09.840 align:middle line:90%
Without agenda.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.882 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how
the laws of physics work.

00:12:11.882 --> 00:12:12.682 align:middle line:90%
So we can--

00:12:12.682 --> 00:12:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I think you just
have to be very open-minded.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.390 align:middle line:90%
You don't even have to believe.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.390 align:middle line:84%
I think if you believe,
it's actually an impediment,

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:18.720 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:19.750 align:middle line:90%
Just open.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle line:84%
The experience becomes
self-affirming.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.230 align:middle line:90%
And you think, oh, I saw this.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but it's coming
from your own head.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: If you just
go there and say, well,

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.647 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know what it
is, and you just go there with

00:12:28.647 --> 00:12:30.960 align:middle line:84%
an open mind, your
own electrical field,

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.315 align:middle line:84%
because we are electromagnetic
beings to begin with--

00:12:33.315 --> 00:12:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --it connects with the
other electromagnetic field.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you walk
into these little hotspots,

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.690 align:middle line:90%
something happens.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.200 align:middle line:84%
I have a very
technical word for it.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.610 align:middle line:90%
It's called a tingly wingly.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And you feel the tingly
wingly when you--

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let me look that up.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.552 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it literally--
and especially on your hands,

00:12:48.552 --> 00:12:50.760 align:middle line:84%
because these are the most
sensitive electrical parts

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.160 align:middle line:90%
of your body.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are
our tingly winglies.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You get
the tingly wingly

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.530 align:middle line:84%
when you walk through the
perimeter of these hotspots.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're in this sort of
room where suddenly you look up

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.732 align:middle line:84%
and you go, wow, there's
nothing between me

00:13:01.732 --> 00:13:02.940 align:middle line:90%
and the rest of the universe.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.145 align:middle line:84%
You feel very naked
for a few moments.

00:13:05.145 --> 00:13:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
actually seeing things out

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.348 align:middle line:90%
of your peripheral vision.

00:13:08.348 --> 00:13:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And the more you do it,
the more it becomes real.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.540 align:middle line:84%
The more-- even though it's
in its own level of reality--

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.690 align:middle line:84%
the visions and the people and
the entities that I experience,

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:17.560 align:middle line:90%
they're very real.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me, it's
like an extended family.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.015 align:middle line:84%
I remember one time we
were-- when I was still

00:13:22.015 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:84%
learning this craft with a
very good friend of mine who's

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.790 align:middle line:84%
an incredible psychic,
who works with the police

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.840 align:middle line:84%
in Britain, by the
way, to solve crimes.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And she was just
teaching us the ropes

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.135 align:middle line:84%
of how to work with
this energy and how

00:13:32.135 --> 00:13:34.830 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
subtle energy and how

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.380 align:middle line:84%
to make sure you understand
that it's coming from the field

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and not from your own ego and
your need for validation--

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.860 align:middle line:84%
it's a big difference
between the two.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And we just cleansed
this area, which

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.470 align:middle line:84%
is an old mound, which
then became a burial mound.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And I remember at the
end standing there

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.720 align:middle line:90%
with my arms to my side.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, someone's
holding onto one of my fingers.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And I pulled up this sort
of creature which was naked.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.330 align:middle line:90%
It was about this big.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.290 align:middle line:84%
It looked like it had a
turnip head with a big belly

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:02.470 align:middle line:90%
and little spindly legs.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what
the hell are you?

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:04.720 align:middle line:90%
And he went, [GIBBERISH].

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:84%
I said, it's got
a bit of an ego.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:07.830 align:middle line:90%
I just put it back down.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.482 align:middle line:84%
And it just looked up at
me like, how dare you?

00:14:10.482 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are
you doing in my space?

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And he just kept
holding on to my finger.

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:15.580 align:middle line:90%
And then we walked back out.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.750 align:middle line:90%
And he was just holding on.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And we got to the perimeter
of the energy field.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And you get, again, that tingle
on your hand, that sensation.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.385 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, poof.

00:14:22.385 --> 00:14:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gone.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It vanishes.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because we were
there to cleanse--

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They only
exist in that frequency.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, they only exist
within that particular area.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.220 align:middle line:90%
That's their little portal.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.675 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But it was wonderful
because we were there

00:14:31.675 --> 00:14:35.220 align:middle line:84%
to cleanse any negative energy,
any old remnants of old patterns

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.580 align:middle line:84%
of thought that were keeping
these entities stuck here when

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:90%
they needed to go elsewhere.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.313 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So they came back
to say, well, thank you

00:14:42.313 --> 00:14:43.900 align:middle line:84%
for helping me go
back to where I was.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:84%
But that was just--
the onion head was

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:84%
one of the funniest
people I've ever

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.160 align:middle line:84%
encountered, a
lovely little fella.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.618 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
you're telling-- it

00:14:50.618 --> 00:14:52.710 align:middle line:84%
reminds me, speaking
of vulnerability.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was naked at
a surprise birthday party

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.730 align:middle line:84%
when I went into the
cave above the baptismal

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:90%
well in Ein Karem, Israel.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:90%
There, John the Baptist--

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:84%
they've built a monastery
around that site.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.140 align:middle line:90%
And they have a baptismal well.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.775 align:middle line:90%
But up above it is a cave.

00:15:08.775 --> 00:15:10.650 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard anybody
talk about the cave.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever been in it?

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: No.

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've
got to check it out.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.240 align:middle line:84%
I was at a party that I
could not have imagined.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:84%
So much was able to enter
into my field of vision

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.130 align:middle line:90%
in that little cave.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Very similar to what you're
talking about, just vulnerable,

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.470 align:middle line:90%
because you can't expect it.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know
what it's about.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And I just sat down like a
five-year-old and watched

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.522 align:middle line:84%
and listened to what the message
was, which was incredible.

00:15:35.522 --> 00:15:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I think
you have to trust.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You have to trust.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.685 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I think if you
trust and don't go in fear.

00:15:39.685 --> 00:15:42.068 align:middle line:84%
The worst thing to do about
this is go in with fear.

00:15:42.068 --> 00:15:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the main things
you learn in mystery schools.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:45.850 align:middle line:90%
You've got to control the fear.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.475 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to
be afraid of because

00:15:47.475 --> 00:15:48.970 align:middle line:84%
if you take that
in with you, you

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.102 align:middle line:84%
will attract things which will
amplify that fear, which is not

00:15:52.102 --> 00:15:52.935 align:middle line:90%
what you want to do.

00:15:52.935 --> 00:15:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: So you go in there.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.253 align:middle line:90%
You're in perfect balance.

00:15:55.253 --> 00:15:57.400 align:middle line:84%
You're very grounded,
very centered and open

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and willing to say, well,
what is this all about?

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:00.500 align:middle line:90%
I want to know more.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, all this
stuff comes at you.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And so in my case, I'm trying
to be a better teacher,

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:06.950 align:middle line:90%
to be a better writer.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I want to
understand what this is about.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.027 align:middle line:84%
So I attract these
things into my aura,

00:16:12.027 --> 00:16:14.360 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better word,
because they're saying, well,

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.410 align:middle line:90%
this is what it's about.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Now you have to go
off to a library

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.680 align:middle line:90%
and dig out the information.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then you do the hard
work back there in your domain.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, yeah.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.680 align:middle line:90%
They don't do it all for you.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You take people all
the time to these sacred sites.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.630 align:middle line:84%
So do you find that some of
the people that come along

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.780 align:middle line:90%
have fear when they--

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.530 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about it
so you can give people

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.915 align:middle line:84%
that might be considering this
the range of how one responds,

00:16:35.915 --> 00:16:37.540 align:middle line:84%
because it never
occurred to me someone

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.670 align:middle line:84%
would be fearful to
encounter these things.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one
of the things that

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:84%
happens when you interact with
portals for a lot of time--

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:49.250 align:middle line:84%
it's a bit like driving a car,
in that your first day, you're

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.185 align:middle line:84%
glued to the wheel
and you're sweating.

00:16:51.185 --> 00:16:53.887 align:middle line:84%
And now it's like you
drive for 400 miles,

00:16:53.887 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:84%
you don't even realize
you've done it.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.920 align:middle line:90%
So basically, you're in control.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.970 align:middle line:84%
You also develop a sense where
your own auric field expands.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.720 align:middle line:84%
So I get to the point
where I can actually

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.160 align:middle line:84%
see through people, which is
a good thing and a bad thing

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:05.960 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.228 align:middle line:90%
It's a blessing and a curse.

00:17:07.228 --> 00:17:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And the first day, I'll
watch people coming

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.312 align:middle line:90%
in from all parts of the world.

00:17:10.312 --> 00:17:11.210 align:middle line:90%
And I go--

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oops.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I'm going to
keep a track on these two

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.710 align:middle line:84%
because they are-- they're
bringing a lot of baggage

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:16.079 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:17.787 align:middle line:84%
And I have to work
with them a little bit

00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:20.819 align:middle line:84%
and bring them down to Earth
and get them a bit more settled,

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:23.210 align:middle line:84%
because I have to tell them
straight out that what you

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.319 align:middle line:90%
take in is what you get out.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you take in fear and bring
all your baggage and problems,

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.960 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go back home
with 10 times that much stuff.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.252 align:middle line:90%
That's not what you want to do.

00:17:32.252 --> 00:17:34.410 align:middle line:84%
You've paid money to
come on this trip.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.790 align:middle line:84%
I want you to let
go of the fear.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
do anything else,

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:40.490 align:middle line:84%
just trust me that I know
mostly what I'm doing.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to take
you to a couple of places

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.550 align:middle line:84%
where you will feel a
little uncomfortable.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:48.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's to get you to accept
that you are in control and not

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.740 align:middle line:90%
to let it overwhelm you.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.420 align:middle line:84%
If you can do
that, you'll be OK.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And usually, I send people
down a big, long shaft

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:90%
at the Bent Pyramid.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:57.660 align:middle line:90%
It's about 400 feet.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And even I have to bend down
double like Groucho Marx.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.180 align:middle line:90%
It's very uncomfortable.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's a large
lady, very Rubenesque.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And she's saying, I don't
know if I can do this.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bit fearful.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.990 align:middle line:90%
I said, do what you can.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you feel
uncomfortable, leave.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.240 align:middle line:90%
That's the rule.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.648 align:middle line:84%
At the bottom of the
building, there she is.

00:18:16.648 --> 00:18:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And she's going, I can't
believe I just did that.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's wonderful.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: You overcame your fear.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:21.080 align:middle line:90%
Look at you.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:21.535 align:middle line:90%
You're in control.

00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, I can't
wait to do the next one.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Well done.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:90%
You've overcome that.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.800 align:middle line:84%
But then the next step happens
where their auric field

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.350 align:middle line:84%
is so expanded that they
begin to see what I can see.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Within 10 days, people
are seeing-- we're

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:90%
inside the King's Chamber.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And it depends on the group
experience and the group energy.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a new
experience every time.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes something doesn't
happen because everybody's

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.420 align:middle line:90%
on a different level.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.400 align:middle line:84%
But people will
see a moment where

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about something
and I'm looking up at the room,

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.750 align:middle line:90%
and it's complete darkness.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And I see the stars
in the ceiling.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:90%
The ceiling has disappeared.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards,
I'll say to people,

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.270 align:middle line:84%
well, tell me something
that's happened

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.490 align:middle line:84%
to you in the last
few hours while we're

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.520 align:middle line:84%
up there, even if it sounds
crazy, because I like crazy.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And half the group
will say, yeah, there's

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:08.420 align:middle line:84%
a moment where you did
this and you said that,

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.930 align:middle line:90%
and then it's complete darkness.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:11.800 align:middle line:84%
But I opened my eyes
and there's no ceiling.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.600 align:middle line:90%
I saw the stars.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.440 align:middle line:90%
I go, thank you.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:90%
I knew I wasn't mad.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.700 align:middle line:84%
But one of my favorites
was actually in France.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:22.470 align:middle line:84%
We went to one of the largest
stones at Menhir called Dol,

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and it's not far from
Mont Saint-Michel.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not even the
biggest stone in France.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.230 align:middle line:90%
It's just half size.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.210 align:middle line:90%
It's only 32 feet tall.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.407 align:middle line:84%
It took 16 people to hold
hands to go around the girth.

00:19:32.407 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And I said, we're going
to do a bit of toning here

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.323 align:middle line:84%
to show you the energy
field and how you can

00:19:36.323 --> 00:19:38.310 align:middle line:90%
interact with these portals.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.640 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
water the stone.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Now one guy said, I'm not
feeling comfortable with this.

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:44.910 align:middle line:90%
I was raised as a Catholic.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.805 align:middle line:90%
This smells of witchcraft.

00:19:46.805 --> 00:19:47.930 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, that's cool.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Why you're on this
tour, I don't know.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:50.713 align:middle line:90%
But that's cool.

00:19:50.713 --> 00:19:52.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to force
anything upon you.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.330 align:middle line:90%
Just sit here.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And someone, like the
management, said to me,

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.400 align:middle line:84%
why don't you draw a
little line on the ground

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.400 align:middle line:90%
here where he's sitting?

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.490 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, this
is going to be fun.

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:03.895 align:middle line:84%
So I drew a little line
exactly where he was sitting.

00:20:03.895 --> 00:20:04.770 align:middle line:90%
And then I went back.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.610 align:middle line:84%
We turned, we put some notes
of sound into the stone.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel
something expanding.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And I had shown before the
energy field around the stone,

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.730 align:middle line:90%
it has its own aura.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:15.960 align:middle line:90%
I said, this is where it is.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.350 align:middle line:84%
It's about 6 feet
around the actual stone.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:19.850 align:middle line:84%
At the end I
thought, OK, now I'm

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.280 align:middle line:84%
going to show you with the
dowsing rods what we've done

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:90%
to interact with this portal.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Our intention is to have
expanded the energy.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.120 align:middle line:90%
And they'll go, OK, prove it.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And I went beyond
the first mark,

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:33.530 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to the mark
which is 36 feet away, where

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:36.650 align:middle line:84%
the guy had been sitting--
except now, he wasn't sitting

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:37.680 align:middle line:90%
on the picnic table.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.650 align:middle line:90%
He was flat on his back.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:40.490 align:middle line:90%
And I helped him up.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what
happened to you?

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well,
there's a moment where

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.240 align:middle line:90%
you hit a certain note.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's like this invisible
hand just went right through me.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:49.510 align:middle line:84%
It knocked me right
over flat on my back.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.590 align:middle line:90%
And I said, and?

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to go
to the next site.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.960 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, it convinced him.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And I said yeah, this
is their way of saying--

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.650 align:middle line:84%
a very non-threatening
way of saying-- yeah,

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:58.775 align:middle line:90%
you can interact with this.

00:20:58.775 --> 00:21:00.055 align:middle line:90%
And it's for your own benefit.

00:21:00.055 --> 00:21:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Now what do you want to
do while you're here?

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, he became
a completely different person

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.490 align:middle line:84%
because he was able
to extract the tools

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.980 align:middle line:84%
necessary at these
portals to help him

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.460 align:middle line:90%
with his particular issues.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And he's a very
different person for it.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:12.880 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How wonderful.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And I
didn't say anything.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:90%
I didn't suggest anything.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.910 align:middle line:90%
He did the work.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have you ever
been in a situation

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.520 align:middle line:84%
where the entities
were such that you felt

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:90%
you should be afraid of them?

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is our dimension.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:25.800 align:middle line:90%
I've not.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: No.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:27.803 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is our dimension.

00:21:27.803 --> 00:21:28.640 align:middle line:90%
This is our domain.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:29.265 align:middle line:90%
You're in control.

00:21:29.265 --> 00:21:31.682 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're not going
to hurt you in this dimension.

00:21:31.682 --> 00:21:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Even moving over into theirs,
you still have control.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's a law
of non-intervention

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.690 align:middle line:84%
where you can't intervene in the
development of another species.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:41.150 align:middle line:84%
That's called a Prime Directive
in "Star Trek," by the way.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And no, I've encountered
entities where they'll say,

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:90%
you're not ready for this.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.045 align:middle line:90%
And they're absolutely right.

00:21:48.045 --> 00:21:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I was first
learning this craft,

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.087 align:middle line:84%
I went to a place called
the Devil's Den in England.

00:21:52.087 --> 00:21:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Guaranteed, it's a
good place if it's

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.135 align:middle line:90%
called the devil's something.

00:21:55.135 --> 00:21:57.510 align:middle line:84%
So I figured, I think I'm
going to go to the Devil's Den.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.970 align:middle line:84%
But of course,
what I didn't know

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:02.143 align:middle line:84%
is that the Devil's Den
is a very raw power place.

00:22:02.143 --> 00:22:03.560 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
first sacred sites

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.060 align:middle line:84%
to be built in the
South of England.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not far from
Avery stone circle.

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
crossing the field

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.980 align:middle line:90%
and legging it over the fence.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And I heard this big booming
voice out of nowhere,

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.630 align:middle line:84%
"You are not going
to come any closer."

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, frankly, the
farmers found out that I'm here.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.870 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get permission to
be here, even though they're

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.620 align:middle line:90%
usually quite nice about it.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, no, I'm
just imagining things.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:25.850 align:middle line:90%
So I kept walking.

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
definite pressure wave

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.090 align:middle line:84%
that's coming towards me saying,
no, you're not coming here.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:30.840 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm out.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Legged it over the fence, got
in my car, went to see my friend

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:34.890 align:middle line:90%
the psychic.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.300 align:middle line:90%
And she was making a cup of tea.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And she says, have you just
been to the Devil's Den?

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.310 align:middle line:90%
I said, how did you know?

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.660 align:middle line:84%
I know everything, yeah,
she does, doesn't she?

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, because it's raw energy.

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.170 align:middle line:90%
You're still learning the craft.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Come back
a few years later

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:84%
when you've gained a
bit more experience.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you
can handle it better.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.907 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: When you can handle it,
because your electrical current

00:22:52.907 --> 00:22:53.930 align:middle line:10%
is being raised as well.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.890 align:middle line:10%
It's a bit like going
to Egyptian temples.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.760 align:middle line:10%
You would never go to the Great
Pyramid on your first day.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:02.390 align:middle line:10%
I take people down to the
south, to the Temple of Philae,

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:06.420 align:middle line:10%
build up from there, up the
Nile, build up your resistivity.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And then you go
to the big prize.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.410 align:middle line:90%
And then you're ready for it.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:10.650 align:middle line:90%
It was the same with me.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:12.235 align:middle line:84%
And three years
later, I went back.

00:23:12.235 --> 00:23:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a
red carpet treatment.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, oh, this guy
knows what he's doing now.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:90%
Come in.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.265 align:middle line:90%
But then you get to that level.

00:23:18.265 --> 00:23:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And now you're ready to go
to the next level, which

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:84%
would be the Peruvian
sites, which are really,

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:90%
really raw power.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't do that until
my 50s, and thank god,

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.600 align:middle line:84%
because then I knew what
I was doing at that point.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.310 align:middle line:90%
And it became very beneficial.

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So a
little discernment.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A little discernment.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Learn to
trust your feelings.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But for the most
part, don't go in fear,

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.080 align:middle line:84%
because nothing's going
to harm you there.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.335 align:middle line:84%
So, OK, let's go to mounds,
because you've been to pyramids.

00:23:46.335 --> 00:23:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Each one has a very
different signature

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and was built for
different purposes.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And some of the mounds,
like Newgrange and North

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.620 align:middle line:90%
and West Kennet Long Barrow.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I thought I did an
interview with someone.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:59.923 align:middle line:10%
There were giants, giant
bodies found near Long Barrow?

00:23:59.923 --> 00:24:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Only 8.5 feet tall.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, only for us.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm 5'3 and 1/2.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:06.660 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, it's a giant for me.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.500 align:middle line:90%
But anyway.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and you and I can
talk about that in a minute

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.010 align:middle line:84%
because we went to giants
caves in Sardinia together.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.080 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead
and talk about mounds

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.578 align:middle line:84%
and the energy they bring
versus the pyramidal structures.

00:24:17.578 --> 00:24:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, the mounds are
fascinating because most people

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.480 align:middle line:84%
think that they're just a
bunch of little rubbish heaps

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.200 align:middle line:84%
with a little passage
in the middle.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Turns out that they're
actually built very cleverly

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.960 align:middle line:84%
with layers of organic
and inorganic material.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And what it does, it
creates a kind of a device.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.970 align:middle line:84%
It starts to shield the
exterior frequencies.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:84%
So when you go on the
inside, and if you

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.385 align:middle line:84%
have expensive equipment, you
can actually measure this.

00:24:40.385 --> 00:24:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And they found that the
frequency is actually

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.820 align:middle line:84%
shielded in such a
way that it draws

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.630 align:middle line:84%
the interior frequencies down
to a place where that aligns

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:49.530 align:middle line:90%
with your brainwave patterns.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.620 align:middle line:84%
They get you to stop
thinking and get

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.220 align:middle line:90%
you to start feeling the site.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.280 align:middle line:84%
So at the moment
you walk in, you're

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.580 align:middle line:84%
already being manipulated
in a positive word--

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:02.017 align:middle line:84%
where a connotation
of the word to start--

00:25:02.017 --> 00:25:03.600 align:middle line:84%
stop thinking about
what you're doing,

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.558 align:middle line:84%
stop the intellectual
process and get you there

00:25:05.558 --> 00:25:07.107 align:middle line:90%
to actually bring it all in.

00:25:07.107 --> 00:25:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And places like Newgrange are
fascinating because if you

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.337 align:middle line:84%
look at the actual stones,
they're not just rocks.

00:25:12.337 --> 00:25:14.670 align:middle line:84%
They're rocks with a lot of
magnetite and a lot of iron.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And each rock has its
own magnetic polarity.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.210 align:middle line:84%
They're able to actually twist
the rock around and place it

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:24.080 align:middle line:84%
in that passage so that there's
a positive and a negative pole

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.500 align:middle line:90%
either side of the passage.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.650 align:middle line:84%
So as you're walking,
and again, you're

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.110 align:middle line:84%
walking in humility
a little bit lower.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.160 align:middle line:84%
How the 8.5 foot
tall people did it,

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't because they literally
would have been dragging

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.390 align:middle line:90%
their knuckles on the ground.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:84%
But you're being moved
from left to right,

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.900 align:middle line:90%
left to right all the time.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like walking
through a labyrinth.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.510 align:middle line:84%
You're going to left brain,
right brain, left brain

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:90%
to right brain.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:46.555 align:middle line:90%
And the prize is the center.

00:25:46.555 --> 00:25:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So when you
get to the center--

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Balanced, corpus
callosum right there.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: The altar.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.120 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's
called the altar.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.180 align:middle line:90%
You are altered.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.305 align:middle line:84%
But in order to be altered,
you got to be balanced.

00:25:56.305 --> 00:25:59.150 align:middle line:84%
You got to be the single
person, as Jesus called it.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Only the single people can
enter the Kingdom of heaven.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:02.853 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely right.

00:26:02.853 --> 00:26:04.270 align:middle line:84%
You have to cross
the other world.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.020 align:middle line:84%
You have to cross the
world as one entity.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Not too masculine, too feminine.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:08.550 align:middle line:90%
No, just right.

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:09.470 align:middle line:90%
Just balanced.

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:11.117 align:middle line:84%
And they found
that this stuff was

00:26:11.117 --> 00:26:13.200 align:middle line:84%
happening all around the
world, in France as well.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.820 align:middle line:84%
In Sardinia, it was
the same process.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.360 align:middle line:84%
So it was a sort of a
spiritual technology that

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.910 align:middle line:84%
was designed, again, to
get you to go and have

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:21.500 align:middle line:84%
these experiences
when you forgot

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.070 align:middle line:90%
that you can do it yourself.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.770 align:middle line:84%
So anybody in India would
laugh at this and oh, no, no,

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:27.420 align:middle line:84%
you don't need
temples to do that.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.740 align:middle line:90%
We call it kriya yoga.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.610 align:middle line:84%
You go within to the temple,
the portal inside you

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and you can manipulate
that geomagnetic field

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and the geometry that
makes up the human body.

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And you can go internally
and develop yourself.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.600 align:middle line:84%
But when you don't believe in
your ability that you are a god,

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.857 align:middle line:84%
then we built these temples
for you to imitate the process.

00:26:45.857 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:90%
So it's very clever.

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.195 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you could go
find that part of yourself.

00:26:48.195 --> 00:26:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:49.535 align:middle line:90%
It's like an insurance policy.

00:26:49.535 --> 00:26:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: You know.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So caves
really serve as this.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Often time caves are rounded,
usually most of the caves.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.410 align:middle line:90%
I love going in caves.

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:59.580 align:middle line:84%
I find it very easy to
connect with other realms

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.470 align:middle line:90%
and such in caves.

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.845 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's just an
informal natural structure.

00:27:03.845 --> 00:27:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it's funny
how some caves are

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.070 align:middle line:84%
more sacred than others and how
some mountains are more sacred.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:10.860 align:middle line:90%
I was asking this for years.

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
sitting, and I was

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.790 align:middle line:84%
standing in front
of CBT or Shiprock,

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:18.550 align:middle line:84%
as they call it in the Four
Corners, it's a terrible name.

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:21.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like a petrified angel
that comes out of the ground.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And I remember sitting there
the first time and going,

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.740 align:middle line:90%
what's this about?

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Wrong question, because the
world just comes right at you

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:29.470 align:middle line:90%
with information.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself speaking
in Navajo, which is--

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't speak Navajo, and I
wrote it down and actually

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.345 align:middle line:90%
meant-- it was like a greeting.

00:27:36.345 --> 00:27:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I said, where did
that come from?

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear people
around me dancing,

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.400 align:middle line:90%
and I began to dance with them.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a dancer.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.275 align:middle line:90%
I don't do this.

00:27:43.275 --> 00:27:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly
they're saying,

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:46.192 align:middle line:84%
well, there's a
sacred cave up there.

00:27:46.192 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Why is this-- why
is it a sacred cave

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:50.080 align:middle line:90%
and why are there normal caves?

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.420 align:middle line:90%
And why is this mountain sacred?

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.020 align:middle line:90%
Boom!

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:52.870 align:middle line:90%
Research.

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:53.820 align:middle line:84%
You start looking
at this and you

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.320 align:middle line:90%
go, yes, there's a connection.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.840 align:middle line:84%
All the sacred mountains
are geomagnetic hotspots,

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.310 align:middle line:84%
and they're gravitational
hotspots, too.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:04.500 align:middle line:84%
So it only takes a little change
in the local gravitational field

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and the local
electromagnetic field for DNA

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:09.400 align:middle line:84%
to receive different
forms of information.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.660 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they deem sacred,
because you are receiving

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:17.268 align:middle line:84%
a new book or a new piece of
information that you take inside

00:28:17.268 --> 00:28:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and you leave the
sacred cave and you

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:21.390 align:middle line:90%
go, oh, that's interesting.

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:23.460 align:middle line:84%
We can-- well, we
could be better people

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.465 align:middle line:84%
because of the information
I just received.

00:28:25.465 --> 00:28:26.590 align:middle line:90%
So that was the difference.

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:28.920 align:middle line:84%
They could already sense
that there was something

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.190 align:middle line:90%
unusual about the location.

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And you say that
to people in Australia

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:34.410 align:middle line:84%
and they'll just
roll their eyeballs

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and said, oh, yeah, we
call those a Djalkiri.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.650 align:middle line:84%
We had those spirit
roads everywhere.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And we were walking
across the desert

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly you
turn left or right

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.640 align:middle line:84%
because you can
hear the song that's

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.760 align:middle line:84%
memorialized in these
magnetic strips of tape

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.880 align:middle line:90%
along the landscape.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And they'll walk for 60 miles
across a featureless desert

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:54.180 align:middle line:90%
to another sacred site.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And it connects all
the sacred sites

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.510 align:middle line:90%
with this invisible matrix.

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, it took a couple of
researchers who were actually

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.675 align:middle line:90%
a bit more open.

00:29:00.675 --> 00:29:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I think they were from the
University of Melbourne,

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.390 align:middle line:84%
if I'm not mistaken,
or Adelaide.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And they said, let's
find out if it's true.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't really make
this stuff up because if you do,

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:09.900 align:middle line:90%
you die.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:10.700 align:middle line:90%
It's desert.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:90%
There are no redeeming features.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.220 align:middle line:84%
They found that if you
used these special tracks,

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.270 align:middle line:84%
these invisible energy lines,
to get from sacred space

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:22.830 align:middle line:84%
to sacred space, the margin
of error is less than 3%.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:26.470 align:middle line:84%
When you take these lines to
go to non spiritual places,

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.725 align:middle line:90%
the margin of error is over 67%

00:29:28.725 --> 00:29:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Didn't they have that
experiment with some Aboriginal

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.730 align:middle line:90%
people?

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they could
go right there.

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:36.550 align:middle line:84%
They could make a beeline
for the sacred site.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:37.690 align:middle line:90%
And they'll just be--

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But a random site, no.

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: No.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:41.080 align:middle line:90%
They'll be hearing the land.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.120 align:middle line:90%
The energy field is open.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.730 align:middle line:84%
They're taking in all the
subtleties of the landscape.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:47.458 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can do this, by the way.

00:29:47.458 --> 00:29:48.750 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's like driving a car.

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.420 align:middle line:84%
The more you do it,
the more you become

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:53.460 align:middle line:84%
attached to the actual
invisible world around you.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's very beneficial.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.780 align:middle line:90%
So they just expand their field.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're aware of everything,
sounds and subtleties

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.300 align:middle line:84%
in the landscape and of course,
invisible people as well.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's what guides
them through the landscape.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 30 years ago
when I was doing this,

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:09.608 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't started dowsing yet.

00:30:09.608 --> 00:30:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And then people were saying,
oh, you don't need dowsing rods,

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.230 align:middle line:90%
you don't need pendulums.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:15.510 align:middle line:84%
You can actually do this
if you do it long enough.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:18.243 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK, crazy
person, now I can sit here

00:30:18.243 --> 00:30:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and I can tell you where
the energy lines are,

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.620 align:middle line:84%
what color they are,
where they're moving to,

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:22.910 align:middle line:90%
what polarity they are.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:24.570 align:middle line:90%
It's second nature to me.

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:26.180 align:middle line:90%
And anybody can do this.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just about expanding
your own energy field

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and being in contact
with everything else.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And it comes in very useful,
not just for survival, but also

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:37.140 align:middle line:84%
for developing
your own intuition,

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.160 align:middle line:84%
as I call it, and also to
get the right winning lottery

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.450 align:middle line:84%
numbers, which
happens so regularly,

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.190 align:middle line:84%
but because it's
not part of my--

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.090 align:middle line:84%
my path in life to
win the lottery,

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:50.480 align:middle line:84%
to become rich, that I get
the numbers every single year.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
something happens, just

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:53.720 align:middle line:90%
when I go to play the number.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.053 align:middle line:84%
The gates are already closed
because someone in the shop

00:30:56.053 --> 00:30:58.190 align:middle line:84%
recognizes him and says,
hi, how have you been?

00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.510 align:middle line:90%
And I thought--

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:00.175 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can't tell you
how many people do this.

00:31:00.175 --> 00:31:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: We have a group
actually in England.

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:02.950 align:middle line:90%
We get together every--

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:04.690 align:middle line:84%
when we get together
and say, how much money

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:05.690 align:middle line:90%
have you lost this year?

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I've lost 60 million.

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.100 align:middle line:90%
And we have a good laugh.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And just
before I left for a trip

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.618 align:middle line:84%
to New Zealand a few months
ago, I got it in my head,

00:31:12.618 --> 00:31:13.910 align:middle line:90%
oh, you need to buy the ticket.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:14.800 align:middle line:90%
I thought, all right.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And then I got busy
packing, and I thought, damn

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:20.240 align:middle line:84%
it, I should have got the
ticket, is only up the road.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.115 align:middle line:84%
And then I was in New
Zealand a week later

00:31:22.115 --> 00:31:24.740 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, let me just check
to see if the numbers came up.

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:25.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they came up.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I won the lottery
again in the shop, just

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.340 align:middle line:84%
up the road where I would have
got my ticket, by the way.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.020 align:middle line:90%
And here's the really sad part.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.810 align:middle line:90%
$1.2 billion.

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, Freddy,
you would have wasted it.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:38.020 align:middle line:90%
You would have--

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.472 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And I'm still
driving a 20-year-old car.

00:31:40.472 --> 00:31:41.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what is up with that?

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
what's up with that.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:45.822 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed to
be in control of 1.2

00:31:45.822 --> 00:31:47.030 align:middle line:90%
however many billion dollars.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I've got
to work hard for--

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've
got to keep working.

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:50.935 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But the point is that
it expands your natural ability.

00:31:50.935 --> 00:31:51.595 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:31:51.595 --> 00:31:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that's
how you use it.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.100 align:middle line:84%
You do it for your own
development, for whatever

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.520 align:middle line:90%
it is you came here to do.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's the other benefit.

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:00.483 align:middle line:84%
You begin to discover
the purpose of your soul.

00:32:00.483 --> 00:32:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that Plato
and Pythagoras were very big on.

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And they said, and I quote,
"interacting with portals

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:10.390 align:middle line:84%
or the sacred places in Greece
is what shaped our metaphysical

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:11.190 align:middle line:90%
doctrine."

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.002 align:middle line:84%
Now, for Plato to
say that tells me

00:32:13.002 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:84%
that he actually experienced
something very profound,

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.510 align:middle line:84%
but he wasn't supposed to
talk about it because you

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:20.030 align:middle line:84%
had a vow of silence
because you weren't supposed

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:21.750 align:middle line:84%
to tell about your
personal experience,

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:24.860 align:middle line:84%
because it would shape the
experience of somebody else.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.660 align:middle line:84%
But your purpose in life
is different to mine.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.790 align:middle line:90%
I can't color your experience.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:31.230 align:middle line:84%
I can't prejudice
your experience.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So I can just say these are
the mechanics behind it.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:34.820 align:middle line:90%
Now you have to go--

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You will have
your own experience.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.153 align:middle line:90%
So let me ask you about--

00:32:37.153 --> 00:32:39.570 align:middle line:84%
I want to get-- there are so
many places I want to get to.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I already mentioned
we went to Sardinia.

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there were mounds that
had their ceremony for, what,

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:49.320 align:middle line:84%
7-8,000 years that had
been going on there,

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.440 align:middle line:84%
also that are open
to the public.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.180 align:middle line:90%
Giants inhabited the land.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.210 align:middle line:90%
Giants tombs.

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And we got to experience again
that beehive dome like energy

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.458 align:middle line:84%
in these places,
which was exquisite.

00:33:01.458 --> 00:33:03.000 align:middle line:84%
But if anyone wants
to know about it,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.560 align:middle line:84%
they can go watch
that series on Gaia.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.738 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we won't
need to go into it.

00:33:06.738 --> 00:33:09.620 align:middle line:84%
One place I lived for
years and people come

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.300 align:middle line:84%
to from all around the
world is Sedona, Arizona.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Pretty accessible for most
people within the US anyway.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.685 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever have any unique
experiences in Sedona?

00:33:18.685 --> 00:33:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, but
none of the places

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.550 align:middle line:84%
that they have on the
local map, which is usually

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:23.965 align:middle line:90%
marked by jeep companies.

00:33:23.965 --> 00:33:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:24.710 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The more jeep companies
that appear are doing it,

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.645 align:middle line:90%
the more portals there are.

00:33:27.645 --> 00:33:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to be
very careful about this.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:31.440 align:middle line:84%
You've got to trust
your own gut feeling.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.450 align:middle line:84%
There was one actually,
it was a trail.

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:37.280 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe how busy
Sedona has become in 25 years

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.370 align:middle line:90%
since I first went there.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I moved
away six years ago,

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.692 align:middle line:84%
and I hear it's
really, really busy.

00:33:41.692 --> 00:33:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So people that tend
to go to the usual places like

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.267 align:middle line:84%
cathedral rock or bell
rock is a classic--

00:33:46.267 --> 00:33:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.040 align:middle line:84%
But no, you've got to
get off where they're--

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --my nice and quiet.

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And I got this lovely
little map on my phone.

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Finally, I found a
good use for my phone.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:59.130 align:middle line:84%
It gives me highly detailed
tracks on the landscape.

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:01.763 align:middle line:84%
And I found 50,000 people going
over there and I'm feeling,

00:34:01.763 --> 00:34:02.930 align:middle line:90%
but I want to go over there.

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.110 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there's a track.

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:05.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's not very well known.

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:06.900 align:middle line:90%
So I just follow that.

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.172 align:middle line:84%
The three hours I
was in complete bliss

00:34:09.172 --> 00:34:11.630 align:middle line:84%
without taking drugs, which
actually you shouldn't be doing

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:13.716 align:middle line:84%
at these places because
it gets in the way

00:34:13.716 --> 00:34:14.674 align:middle line:90%
of the pure experience.

00:34:14.674 --> 00:34:15.716 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:34:15.716 --> 00:34:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I found
my own sacred cave,

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.027 align:middle line:84%
and I sat there for two
hours, away with the fairies,

00:34:20.027 --> 00:34:21.360 align:middle line:90%
literally away with the fairies.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And they came back with a
whole set of notes of stuff

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.460 align:middle line:90%
that I hadn't even asked for.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this has the
makings of a new project.

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I just went there to
connect with the landscape

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:33.690 align:middle line:84%
and see if I can learn
something new and boom!

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:34.530 align:middle line:90%
There you have it.

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:37.250 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to trust your
own sort of feeling when you're

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:40.089 align:middle line:84%
on the land and just follow that
guidance and see where it goes.

00:34:40.089 --> 00:34:40.889 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And in Sedona, not to advertise
for more tourists to Sedona,

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:48.210 align:middle line:84%
but it seems that everything
is quite available.

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I remember
before I even moved there,

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:53.297 align:middle line:84%
going there and going to
one of the sites off road,

00:34:53.297 --> 00:34:54.630 align:middle line:90%
you have to find your way to it.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:57.620 align:middle line:84%
But in any event,
I remember being

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:02.210 align:middle line:84%
in the dwellings that the Native
American populations of far past

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:04.290 align:middle line:90%
had been in and they were there.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:06.360 align:middle line:84%
You could see them
walking around.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:10.490 align:middle line:84%
I actually went into a
chamber and was witnessing.

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:13.430 align:middle line:84%
It shocked me at the time, but
like a 12-year-old girl giving

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:14.988 align:middle line:90%
birth and such.

00:35:14.988 --> 00:35:16.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's all right
there and available.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:17.795 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They're
never left away.

00:35:17.795 --> 00:35:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It never left.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:19.135 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: They never left.

00:35:19.135 --> 00:35:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I mean, the Sinagua--

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:21.980 align:middle line:90%
I love the Sinagua.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And they're just South
in Montezuma's castle.

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:25.320 align:middle line:90%
Terrible name again.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: That's a lovely area.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:29.008 align:middle line:84%
Not that I'm trying to
bring more people there.

00:35:29.008 --> 00:35:31.910 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that
the people are still

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:34.650 align:middle line:84%
there because when they died
before they left the body,

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:36.590 align:middle line:84%
they would say, well,
what does the tribe need

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:38.900 align:middle line:90%
for its continuous development?

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.115 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a place where
not much water exists,

00:35:41.115 --> 00:35:41.915 align:middle line:90%
for one thing.

00:35:41.915 --> 00:35:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So they
would say, well,

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.520 align:middle line:84%
we need more rain because
otherwise the crops

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.320 align:middle line:90%
are going to fail.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.778 align:middle line:84%
So when they die, the spirit
goes back into the other world

00:35:48.778 --> 00:35:51.540 align:middle line:84%
and literally, within
minutes, it starts raining.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.737 align:middle line:84%
So they're in the elements
of the actual place,

00:35:53.737 --> 00:35:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and I just love
hanging out with them.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So just because
you're dead doesn't

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:57.955 align:middle line:90%
mean you can't be useful.

00:35:57.955 --> 00:35:58.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:58.755 --> 00:36:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And so and Wupatki
Canyon, that's another place.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.990 align:middle line:84%
There's a cliff dwelling
there, which I love going to.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:06.067 align:middle line:84%
Now that you have to
go on a guided tour

00:36:06.067 --> 00:36:07.650 align:middle line:84%
because you became
a bit more popular.

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:10.700 align:middle line:84%
But if you get to
know the people there

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.852 align:middle line:84%
off the beaten, off
the record, they'll

00:36:13.852 --> 00:36:15.560 align:middle line:84%
say, well, come back
after hours and I'll

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.150 align:middle line:84%
bring some sandwiches
and some nice water.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.950 align:middle line:90%
We'll go and talk.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's all
you want to do it.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.840 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:22.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:24.150 align:middle line:84%
We only have seven or
eight minutes left,

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:25.140 align:middle line:90%
so I've got to get to--

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:25.530 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Let's speed talk.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:28.230 align:middle line:90%
A couple of other things now.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.340 align:middle line:90%
Medieval times.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm bringing this
up because for people

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.560 align:middle line:84%
who aren't going to caves and
they're not going to mounds,

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.120 align:middle line:84%
but say, they're in
beautiful cities of Europe

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.360 align:middle line:84%
and such where incredibly
sacred temples have

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.170 align:middle line:90%
been built over sacred spots.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.180 align:middle line:84%
There is iconography
that had to do

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.710 align:middle line:90%
with this, like the green men.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Tell us-- Rosslyn Chapel.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what to look for in
these places, if that's where

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:52.600 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be heading.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.634 align:middle line:84%
Which are some of the most
sacred sort of cathedrals?

00:36:56.634 --> 00:36:57.438 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:36:57.438 --> 00:36:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just because you've got
urbanization around the world

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:03.190 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean the
portals disappeared.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I mean, there's one
in the coffee shop downtown

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.980 align:middle line:90%
Portland where I live.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.600 align:middle line:90%
There's one in my living room.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.700 align:middle line:84%
It used to be an
Abenaki sacred site.

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.800 align:middle line:84%
There's one in Central
Park, and there's also

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.480 align:middle line:84%
one underneath the
obelisk in Central Park.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.020 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Scottish Rite
masons put that obelisk there

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.820 align:middle line:90%
to tell you, boom.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Around the perimeter of this
standing stone is a portal,

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:26.230 align:middle line:90%
and it's honored.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.052 align:middle line:84%
So back in the Middle
Ages when the church

00:37:29.052 --> 00:37:30.510 align:middle line:84%
was taking over
the whole of Europe

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.450 align:middle line:84%
and they were literally
destroying the sacred sites

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:35.830 align:middle line:84%
or they would superimpose
their buildings on top of them,

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:39.345 align:middle line:84%
the peasants, for lack of a
better word, would say, well,

00:37:39.345 --> 00:37:40.470 align:middle line:90%
where are the sacred sites?

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you have to come to church
now because we're the new power.

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, that didn't stop the
stonemasons from going,

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:48.340 align:middle line:90%
well, we can work with that.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.920 align:middle line:84%
So they created this
image of The Green Man.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And in one case, in Portugal,
a Green Woman, very rare--

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Actually I found The Green
Woman in a Templar building.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:58.380 align:middle line:90%
I went, oh, finally.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.360 align:middle line:84%
There's The Green Man, because
he's the God of vegetation.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.602 align:middle line:84%
He's the-- the horned
God, the Horniman.

00:38:03.602 --> 00:38:06.060 align:middle line:84%
This is where the term horny
comes from, believe it or not.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:09.690 align:middle line:84%
The man who has the fecundity
of nature and he's always

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:12.240 align:middle line:84%
has these oak leaves coming out
of his mouth and his nostrils

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.120 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.783 align:middle line:84%
So wherever you see this
figure in churches in Europe,

00:38:15.783 --> 00:38:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and there are more images of The
Green Man in churches in Europe

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.910 align:middle line:84%
than there are images of Jesus,
which tells you something

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:23.135 align:middle line:84%
about the power
of The Green Man,

00:38:23.135 --> 00:38:24.510 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
you stand to let

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:26.130 align:middle line:84%
that's where the
telluric current flows

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:27.005 align:middle line:90%
through the building.

00:38:27.005 --> 00:38:28.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little
nod to the locals.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:30.060 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, yeah,
just because there's

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.143 align:middle line:84%
a new building here doesn't
a mean you can't enjoy

00:38:32.143 --> 00:38:35.130 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the temple
because you stand here

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:36.690 align:middle line:90%
and you get the tingling wingly.

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:38.732 align:middle line:84%
And when the church finally
cottoned on to this,

00:38:38.732 --> 00:38:39.940 align:middle line:90%
they said, no more Green Man.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.640 align:middle line:84%
So the stonemasons
decided to carve dragons.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to
Mont Saint-Michel.

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:46.480 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know where
the current goes through,

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.620 align:middle line:90%
start in the cloister.

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Look at the detail
above you, not

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.180 align:middle line:90%
on the ground, detail above you.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Look at little dragons with
little things coming out

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:55.290 align:middle line:84%
of their mouths
and you eventually,

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:57.660 align:middle line:84%
you get to the original
altar, which now you

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:00.960 align:middle line:84%
have to ask politely to go
and see the original altar.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And you get the
tingly winglies again.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.470 align:middle line:84%
So again, just because
we're urbanized

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:05.980 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean they went away.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.850 align:middle line:84%
But the trick is they are so
much more powerful than others

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:10.450 align:middle line:90%
because they're being used.

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:13.270 align:middle line:84%
They're being-- our prayers and
our thoughts go to these places.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Top three
most powerful in Europe.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, God.

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In Europe.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:16.480 align:middle line:90%
And I know it's hard.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's a
terrible question.

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, five.

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.050 align:middle line:90%
You could say five if you want.

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:21.425 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's
really difficult.

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:23.590 align:middle line:84%
My favorite-- it depends
what I'm working with,

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and that goes for anybody
else, what I'm looking for.

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Tumar in Portugal, the Charola
or the Rotunda of the Templars,

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:33.880 align:middle line:84%
because that's very big
on my mind all the time.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.310 align:middle line:90%
That's a very powerful.

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:36.820 align:middle line:90%
Chartres still is.

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a one also around
the corner from Chartres

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:42.270 align:middle line:84%
that nobody goes to,
built by the Cistercians.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's about a
quarter of a mile away,

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and I can't remember
the name of it,

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.950 align:middle line:84%
but you'll find it if
you're looking for it.

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:50.070 align:middle line:84%
It's much nicer energy
because nobody goes there.

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I
haven't been there.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:51.733 align:middle line:90%
I'll have to check it out.

00:39:51.733 --> 00:39:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Very, very nice.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And another one--
ooh, what would I say?

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:57.990 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So we got Portugal--

00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.790 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: Kilpeck.

00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where's Kilp--

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: In a--
which is now sort

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:03.300 align:middle line:90%
of border of England and Wales.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And it has some very interesting
images of the sheen and the gig

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.950 align:middle line:84%
in there, which is the woman
with the wide open vulva

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:13.605 align:middle line:84%
to show that this is where the
Earth energy is very potent.

00:40:13.605 --> 00:40:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:15.825 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's what
the symbol is all about.

00:40:15.825 --> 00:40:18.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a very unassuming old
Celtic Christian church.

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Incredible energy.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my gosh.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.095 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Freestanding
stones outside.

00:40:21.095 --> 00:40:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.340 align:middle line:90%
Got to do that.

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:23.935 align:middle line:90%
Just went to Tintagel recently.

00:40:23.935 --> 00:40:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Certainly get a little
Green Men there.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And Green Man and
some other images,

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.760 align:middle line:84%
including some of the old
Roman stones of the day.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.740 align:middle line:90%
But that's a pretty--

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.875 align:middle line:84%
Tintagel is pretty
spectacular energetically.

00:40:33.875 --> 00:40:34.745 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:40:34.745 --> 00:40:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Especially the cave, and
especially the tube that's

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:38.730 align:middle line:84%
actually inside the
ceiling of the cave

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:41.920 align:middle line:84%
that they had to close up
because the island is hollow.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So they used to do
an initiation ceremony in the.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:48.730 align:middle line:10%
And you watch the-- the idea's
that you watch the sea coming in

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:49.930 align:middle line:10%
from both sides.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.840 align:middle line:10%
And you climb up and climb up
to get away from being drowned

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.777 align:middle line:10%
and you're conquering
your fear because you're

00:40:54.777 --> 00:40:55.610 align:middle line:10%
going to be drowned.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:57.130 align:middle line:90%
So the sound is really quite--

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I didn't go down.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: People
actually do this,

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:02.800 align:middle line:84%
but they used to have a little
hole, a little, again, a tube,

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.410 align:middle line:84%
and you go into
this magnetic portal

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:08.200 align:middle line:84%
because the whole island is a
geomagnetic hotspot, by the way.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:08.655 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's incredible.

00:41:08.655 --> 00:41:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And you go into
this womb, a cave womb,

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:13.780 align:middle line:84%
and you appear at the top,
which is now what is essentially

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.420 align:middle line:84%
a well at the top of Tintagel
because they closed that off

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:17.450 align:middle line:90%
for safety.

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And you used to
come out of there

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and you declare
the newborn person,

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and then you go
to the foot, which

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.030 align:middle line:84%
is on the edge of the cliff
and it's still almost there.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.657 align:middle line:84%
You put your right
foot in there.

00:41:26.657 --> 00:41:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And at the winter
solstice, the energy

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.090 align:middle line:84%
comes from the church
on the opposite side

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:33.760 align:middle line:84%
of the cliff, which is the
dedicated to the Mother

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.020 align:middle line:90%
of the Gods.

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.480 align:middle line:84%
On the winter solstice,
the energy of the sun

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.860 align:middle line:84%
aligns with the telluric
current, goes down to the ocean,

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.780 align:middle line:84%
up the hill, right through your
foot and up your spine to here.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.400 align:middle line:84%
It still works to this very
day because so few people

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.300 align:middle line:90%
know about it.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.217 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:41:48.217 --> 00:41:49.740 align:middle line:90%
Well, I found it spectacular.

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Um, OK, we have very
little time left.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:56.390 align:middle line:84%
But one thing is NASA finally
started recognizing such a thing

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:58.080 align:middle line:90%
as portals on this Earth?

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes, 2008.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:03.515 align:middle line:84%
The wonderful press
release that said,

00:42:03.515 --> 00:42:06.230 align:middle line:84%
oh, magnetic portals
open and close

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:08.820 align:middle line:84%
every eight minutes from
the surface of the Earth,

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.190 align:middle line:84%
connect to the solar wind
and they go to the sun.

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And possibly from
there, everybody else.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:16.340 align:middle line:84%
I think that they go to
the belt stars of Orion

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.440 align:middle line:84%
from there, because every
culture on the planet

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.510 align:middle line:84%
talks about the belt
stars being the biggest

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:23.390 align:middle line:84%
portal in the universe from
where the gods originally

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:25.460 align:middle line:84%
came from and where
in three countries

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.770 align:middle line:84%
that I've heard in the
Pacific, where humans also

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:29.880 align:middle line:84%
came from originally, a
long, long, long time ago.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.920 align:middle line:90%
We don't know when.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And that apparently is
one of the biggest portals

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:35.690 align:middle line:84%
in the entire
universe, which is why

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:38.310 align:middle line:84%
we have the three pyramids
mimicking the belt stars.

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Which is why in New Zealand
we have the same connection.

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:41.820 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And today you can still
go to these places

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.040 align:middle line:84%
at the right time of year,
under the right circumstances,

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.750 align:middle line:84%
and link in and
connect with the gods

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:49.660 align:middle line:84%
and bring in the
information and put them

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:51.410 align:middle line:84%
into the little basket
of knowledge, which

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:53.750 align:middle line:84%
is why when you see the
images of people holding

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:58.910 align:middle line:84%
those little baskets in culture,
in Yucatan or in Sumeria, that

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:01.040 align:middle line:84%
is the wisdom keeper
and the energy

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and the information that you
got from accessing the portal

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.040 align:middle line:90%
is in that basket.

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.180 align:middle line:90%
You are the wisdom keeper.

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not a man bag.

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:10.075 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important sacred
basket of information.

00:43:10.075 --> 00:43:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so
much more exciting

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:15.990 align:middle line:84%
than having one's nose buried
in their Instagram feed all day.

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: What?

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:17.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:18.780 align:middle line:90%
Never heard of it.

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:20.197 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
just-- it's just

00:43:20.197 --> 00:43:22.820 align:middle line:84%
such an exciting world that's
out there if we care to go.

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.140 align:middle line:84%
So final thoughts, Freddy,
before we sign off.

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And also, where are you going
in the coming next couple

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:28.775 align:middle line:90%
of years with your groups?

00:43:28.775 --> 00:43:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, um, the main
thing that I really wanted

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:35.810 align:middle line:84%
to share, and this is the reason
why I sort of wrote the book

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:36.660 align:middle line:90%
in the first place--

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really want to
write a book this year.

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:40.160 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to take a
sabbatical, and then it's

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.903 align:middle line:84%
like, well, why don't you talk
about your personal experiences?

00:43:42.903 --> 00:43:44.195 align:middle line:90%
Because we need them right now.

00:43:44.195 --> 00:43:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: How you ended
up being who you are.

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, who
would be interested?

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:48.390 align:middle line:90%
Said, the whole world.

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.655 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:43:48.655 --> 00:43:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I love it.

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I read it.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:50.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:51.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: OK.

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:53.323 align:middle line:84%
Who am I to disagree
with public opinion?

00:43:53.323 --> 00:43:54.990 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll write
about my experiences.

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:57.525 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it turns out
to be a very good timing

00:43:57.525 --> 00:43:59.150 align:middle line:84%
because we need this
right now, to show

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:02.930 align:middle line:84%
that an ordinary person like me
can become who I am and do what

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I do by acting and working with
these places around the face

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.140 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.490 align:middle line:90%
It will happen for you as well.

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:10.670 align:middle line:84%
So if it's beneficial
for me, it's

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:12.120 align:middle line:90%
beneficial for everybody else.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a self-help
manual in the end.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:18.740 align:middle line:84%
So this is my best advice, is go
out and experience these things

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.370 align:middle line:84%
because they might
be in your own lawn,

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:22.360 align:middle line:84%
they might be in your own living
room as they are with mine.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So I'm
still touring around.

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I just announced two tours
to Portugal, back to back

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:30.005 align:middle line:90%
and they sold out in 50 seconds.

00:44:30.005 --> 00:44:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my God.

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: That surprised even me.

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:34.900 align:middle line:90%
I spoil people on tour.

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:35.700 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've never been
on one of your tours.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna have to.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: You should come along.

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: See if I can--

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: A lot of spiritual
work, a lot of fun afterwards.

00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, the dinner's
gone for four hours.

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, there's the
what I call serious research.

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
serious research.

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:53.390 align:middle line:84%
I will-- I will text you to find
out when all that's happening.

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Freddy, thank you
so much once again.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Really, I'm so glad you're
telling your personal stories

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:00.040 align:middle line:84%
because it makes it
more visceral for people

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:03.110 align:middle line:84%
and to understand,
yeah, that sounds juicy.

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:04.160 align:middle line:90%
I could do that too.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.440 align:middle line:90%
Instead of just theoretical.

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.465 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:45:07.465 --> 00:45:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: My pleasure.

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And again, the
book, I read the book.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very, not only
interesting and entertaining,

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.340 align:middle line:84%
but useful for people who really
want to start on a journey.

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So thank you.

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:20.200 align:middle line:10%
Again, the title of
the book is "Portals,"

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.140 align:middle line:10%
and it's a wonderful guide to
the magic and possibilities

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:26.050 align:middle line:10%
to engage with in these
sacred spots on Earth.

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:29.313 align:middle line:84%
Freddy's website, meanwhile,

you can also watch
our Sardinia series,

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.870 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned
earlier here on Gaia.

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:36.800 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.890 align:middle line:84%
