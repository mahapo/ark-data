00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:30.470 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Many attempts
are being made in these times

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:10%
to reconstruct the story of
how human beings came to be.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.520 align:middle line:84%
As many of us move away from the
more common themes of the older

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.990 align:middle line:84%
religious traditions, we look
to works such as "The Urantia

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Chronicles" to
help piece together

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.150 align:middle line:90%
the story of our origins.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.420 align:middle line:84%
To add to the story,
Timothy Wyllie

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.440 align:middle line:84%
came into contact
with the angelic realm

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.520 align:middle line:84%
during a near death
experience 40 years ago.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.420 align:middle line:84%
He was commissioned
by one of the Watchers

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.480 align:middle line:84%
to allow them to use his
mind and hand to write

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.310 align:middle line:90%
their version of our history.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:84%
The story is very
engaging, telling

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.250 align:middle line:84%
of a heavenly divide in which
certain prominent angels

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.360 align:middle line:84%
rebelled against
the prime directive.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And Timothy, I'm so happy
you're here with us today.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.965 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, I think
I have 100 dog-ears.

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there are-- what?--
300 pages in the book, 400.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I have at least 100
dog-eared pages in it.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.040 align:middle line:90%
It was such a fun story.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.950 align:middle line:84%
But also, there was
an element of such

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.870 align:middle line:84%
a fresh, humble perspective in
it from you, as a human being,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.540 align:middle line:84%
as Georgia, the guide
we're going to hear about,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:84%
the Watcher we're going to hear
about, was writing through you.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And also, these kind
of incongruent feelings

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:84%
human beings have about
themselves, this starts

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.290 align:middle line:84%
answering, I think,
some of those questions.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, let's
hear about your near death

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.660 align:middle line:84%
experience that opened
you up to all of this.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>>TIMOTHY WYLLIE: Sure.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.540 align:middle line:10%
Well, let me just also say that
Georgia and I write together.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:10%
She doesn't really
write through me.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.921 align:middle line:10%
>>WYLLIE: We kind of
write collaboratively.

00:02:02.921 --> 00:02:04.490 align:middle line:10%
It's a fascinating experience.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.873 align:middle line:10%
Because I've had in the
past situations where

00:02:08.873 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:10%
entities have
written through me--

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.099 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: --during
automatic writing.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.425 align:middle line:84%
But this very different
and very exciting.

00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.716 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: But the
near death experience.

00:02:16.716 --> 00:02:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I was in a
spiritual community.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.660 align:middle line:84%
But I really wasn't particularly
spiritual, all right?

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.955 align:middle line:84%
I joined a group
called The Process

00:02:26.955 --> 00:02:32.300 align:middle line:84%
in about-- when I was
about 24, I think.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And I had the near death
experience when I was 33.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was still
in this community.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:84%
But I was in it
for the experience.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.380 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't particularly--

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You are
very analytical.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah,
I'm an architect.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're an
architect, exactly.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: I think
like an architect.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.095 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:47.095 --> 00:02:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Analytical.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to
go into something else that

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.270 align:middle line:90%
preceded that in a bit.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.728 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about the near death

00:02:51.728 --> 00:02:53.780 align:middle line:84%
experience before
we take you there.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: So here I was.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.480 align:middle line:90%
I was working incredibly hard.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:90%
We worked very, very hard.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I was getting about
four hours of sleep

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.450 align:middle line:90%
a night if I was lucky.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:90%
And I just collapsed one day.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.750 align:middle line:90%
I just collapsed.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:90%
I was at my office.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And I just managed to
sort of pull myself up.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.992 align:middle line:84%
It was raining
outside in New York.

00:03:14.992 --> 00:03:15.950 align:middle line:90%
My back went, you know?

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.005 align:middle line:84%
So I was kind of
pulling myself back.

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:24.740 align:middle line:84%
We lived maybe six or seven
blocks from the offices.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So I had to get back
there in the rain.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.250 align:middle line:90%
And I was absolutely exhausted.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.435 align:middle line:90%
And my lungs had played up.

00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:35.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm a Gemini, so
I've got a lung problem.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'm going
to just have a bath.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to draw a bath.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.030 align:middle line:90%
And I lay back in the bath.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.898 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say within 10 seconds
or so of closing my eyes,

00:03:53.898 --> 00:03:58.730 align:middle line:84%
I was 1,500 feet up in
the air, looking down.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my god, what's
happening, you know?

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Next thing I knew, I
was in-- I can only

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.230 align:middle line:90%
describe it as a monorail car.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.675 align:middle line:84%
Because I could see it
was on the monorail,

00:04:10.675 --> 00:04:14.370 align:middle line:84%
this wonderful
gleaming metal rod

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:90%
that came up from this valley.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:90%
And there were trees.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:84%
It was just
absolutely beautiful.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.882 align:middle line:84%
And here I was in this
monorail car, as real as this.

00:04:26.882 --> 00:04:29.380 align:middle line:84%
There was about six
or seven people in it.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.360 align:middle line:84%
There was an old
black man opposite me.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.830 align:middle line:90%
He was playing the trumpet.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.594 align:middle line:90%
It was beautiful.

00:04:34.594 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:90%
It was just wonderful

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is when
you're out of the body.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Oh, yes, completely.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.129 align:middle line:84%
So you're out of the
body and experiencing

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:42.600 align:middle line:84%
this in another realm,
another aspect of this.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: But, you see, what
is interesting about that realm

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.052 align:middle line:84%
is that it is realer
than this realm.

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:48.135 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:04:48.135 --> 00:04:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Because it's so
pregnant with meaning and form,

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.835 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:04:50.835 --> 00:04:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So you're sitting across
from this black man.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: So here I am.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:90%
And it came to me.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're all dying
at the same time.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.630 align:middle line:90%
This is what happens.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the monorail
car, a very bright light--

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.080 align:middle line:90%
I can't see it.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.720 align:middle line:84%
It looks kind of like a
person, but it's mainly light.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.880 align:middle line:90%
I hear in my mind, you're right.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.720 align:middle line:90%
You are dying, all right?

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.600 align:middle line:90%
And I could look down.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And I saw my body in
the bath down there.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And it came to me
that all I would do

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.910 align:middle line:84%
is just lie down and
slip into the water.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.981 align:middle line:90%
And I'd be away and flying.

00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:22.480 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.134 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:23.134 --> 00:05:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: The next
thing the voice

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.730 align:middle line:90%
said is that, yes, you're dying.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.630 align:middle line:84%
But you've completed
what you came to do.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.060 align:middle line:90%
So you have a choice.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.020 align:middle line:84%
You can continue
or you can return.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was absolutely
non-evaluative.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.657 align:middle line:84%
It didn't put an emphasis
on one or the other.

00:05:45.657 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, a lot of
people have-- Why on Earth

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:90%
have you come back?

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
well, this is so incredible

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:84%
that it's just
going to get better.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.270 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know what was
going to happen if I went back.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So it was my curiosity
that did it for me.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: During that time,
that's when you first came

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:08.801 align:middle line:90%
in contact with--

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Not yet.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not yet?

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Not yet.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, OK.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.421 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to rush you.

00:06:12.421 --> 00:06:14.252 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: I said,
OK, I'll go back.

00:06:14.252 --> 00:06:14.835 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:14.835 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: When I said that,
the monorail car dissolved.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.185 align:middle line:84%
And my entire visual field
was made up of angels.

00:06:22.185 --> 00:06:25.454 align:middle line:84%
It was ring upon ring
upon ring of angels.

00:06:25.454 --> 00:06:26.370 align:middle line:90%
And they were singing.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.610 align:middle line:90%
They were playing music.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it was lovely.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Just, oh, my god, I guess
I said the right thing

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.452 align:middle line:90%
when I said I'd go back.

00:06:35.452 --> 00:06:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
in good company.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: I was in good company.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And I got that they
were somehow sort

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.780 align:middle line:84%
of playing the
music of the realm,

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.910 align:middle line:90%
the music of the universe.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.659 align:middle line:84%
That was what was
keeping it all together.

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Music of
the spheres, yes.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: That was the
sort of the feeling.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Next thing-- because
I can't remember,

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.040 align:middle line:84%
these sort of, you know, how
I got from here to there.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.630 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I knew, I was
on the edge of a vast plain,

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.950 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.370 align:middle line:10%
And I'd seen it
somewhere before, I

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.050 align:middle line:10%
think, in Iran, I think.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.085 align:middle line:10%
Because there's a place
called Persepolis.

00:07:11.085 --> 00:07:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you stand in
Persepolis, there's

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.200 align:middle line:84%
a pain that goes
right over there.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.722 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, the next thing
is that two-- and I

00:07:17.722 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:90%
didn't know this at the time.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even believe in
angels at this point--

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.860 align:middle line:84%
two beings either side of
me move me across the plain,

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.200 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.890 align:middle line:90%
And towards this-- now, I can't.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.155 align:middle line:90%
It was a living building.

00:07:31.155 --> 00:07:33.810 align:middle line:84%
It was an enormous building,
but it was a living thing.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.320 align:middle line:90%
It was a structure.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- it was looked like
a sort of an offshore-- one

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:84%
of those oil
platforms, you know?

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it was
intelligent in itself?

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.335 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: It seemed to
be intelligent itself.

00:07:48.335 --> 00:07:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.089 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: It was moving.

00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:52.960 align:middle line:90%
And there were faces on it.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How beautiful.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.645 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: It was an
extraordinary thing.

00:07:55.645 --> 00:07:57.272 align:middle line:84%
I tried to draw it
once, and I never

00:07:57.272 --> 00:07:58.396 align:middle line:90%
could get it exactly right.

00:07:58.396 --> 00:07:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Anyway, again,
the next thing I knew, I

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
was on a table like
this, a flat thing.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.724 align:middle line:90%
I think it was metal.

00:08:05.724 --> 00:08:06.640 align:middle line:90%
And it was a hospital.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.080 align:middle line:84%
It felt like a hospital
thing, all right?

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.914 align:middle line:84%
There were little beings around,
chattering around like that.

00:08:12.914 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:90%
And I was lying there.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.327 align:middle line:90%
Something came over me.

00:08:15.327 --> 00:08:20.635 align:middle line:90%
It swung over, a metal thing.

00:08:20.635 --> 00:08:23.560 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say a female--
I think it was a female,

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.160 align:middle line:90%
it was-- came up behind me.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.477 align:middle line:84%
And I heard, this is
going to really hurt,

00:08:29.477 --> 00:08:31.060 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to
be very, very quick.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.518 align:middle line:84%
It's going to really
hurt, but it's

00:08:32.518 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:90%
going to be very, very quick.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And this thing
came down into me.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.919 align:middle line:90%
And it really hurt.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.252 align:middle line:90%
But it was really, really quick.

00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:42.234 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were warned.

00:08:42.234 --> 00:08:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: And I got up.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Then this was the
final stage of it.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And before I went
there, they said,

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:90%
you'll remember this part.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:84%
But you won't remember what
you're going to see now.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was taken into a place,
which was-- all I can remember,

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.790 align:middle line:90%
it was exquisite.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.060 align:middle line:90%
It was beautiful.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I had no memory of that at
all for maybe 10 or 15 years.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Then I read the out
of the body book.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.370 align:middle line:90%
You've probably read it.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Robert Monroe?

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Monroe's book, yeah.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: And he had a situation
where he was taken to a place.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.020 align:middle line:90%
And it was heaven.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And it clicked, of course,
that that's where I was.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so is that
where you and Georgia

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.155 align:middle line:90%
came into connection then?

00:09:28.155 --> 00:09:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Oddly
enough, no, you see.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: No.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.311 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so I want to
know where Georgia comes in,

00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:84%
because this plays really
is big in all of this.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Georgia's been
with me for-- well, certainly

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.721 align:middle line:90%
from the lifetime from Atlantis.

00:09:43.721 --> 00:09:48.130 align:middle line:84%
I think she's been with me
for a fair amount of time.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.940 align:middle line:84%
The first time she
was actually with me

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.160 align:middle line:84%
was when I was a
baby in the war.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160 align:middle line:84%
We were in the way of
all the bombs dropping.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: And I would be
put under a table, right?

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.300 align:middle line:84%
To protect me under
a table, right?

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.093 align:middle line:84%
It's like our little
drills in school, you know?

00:10:07.093 --> 00:10:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Exactly.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the
bombs would come down.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.242 align:middle line:90%
Crunchy, crunchy, crunchy.

00:10:12.242 --> 00:10:13.745 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:10:13.745 --> 00:10:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And I would pop out
of my little body.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.319 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, how
traumatizing, yes.

00:10:17.319 --> 00:10:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: OK.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And Georgia would
take care of me.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.764 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know this for 40 years.

00:10:22.764 --> 00:10:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.138 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: But that's
how I first met her.

00:10:25.138 --> 00:10:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: And then she
came to me in my 30s once.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.430 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't handle her.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:33.860 align:middle line:90%
She's a rebel angel.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And the sort of
skinny on rebel angels

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.850 align:middle line:90%
is not particularly pleasant.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I understand.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.466 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
get into all of that.

00:10:40.466 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me just
say-- let me have

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:90%
you backtrack for a moment.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.855 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Sure.

00:10:43.855 --> 00:10:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if I
can read this, I will.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is, you were brought
up in a more privileged type--

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.940 align:middle line:84%
considered privileged--
environment in Britain

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.940 align:middle line:84%
in that you went to public
school, which in America are

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.160 align:middle line:90%
very elite private schools.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
were-- your mother

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.169 align:middle line:90%
had a love of architecture.

00:11:04.169 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that you were kind of

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.390 align:middle line:90%
fostered toward at an early age.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But you talk about
your experience there.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And it really--
although we all tend to,

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:84%
especially-- I mean so many
anglophiles in the US, right?

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.840 align:middle line:84%
We tend to so look up to that
or even lust after the lifestyle

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.515 align:middle line:90%
of these plummy British boys.

00:11:25.515 --> 00:11:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.265 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I'm going to
read a passage you wrote

00:11:28.265 --> 00:11:30.530 align:middle line:84%
about it, because
this is so-- this

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.420 align:middle line:84%
is so important because
this is a lot of what

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:84%
the elite structure of the
world is generated from.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Absolutely.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you write-- this
is a quote out of your book

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:90%
about how you experienced it.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:45.030 align:middle line:84%
You said you experienced it
as "the early closing down

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.430 align:middle line:84%
of natural kindness
and compassion

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.320 align:middle line:84%
which becomes part
of the training

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.670 align:middle line:90%
for the leaders of men."

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is the world
we're living in,

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.730 align:middle line:90%
that we have inherited.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:56.152 align:middle line:84%
And you are a rebel
from that world.

00:11:56.152 --> 00:11:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Definitely.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:58.839 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:58.839 --> 00:11:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.100 align:middle line:90%
So I just wanted to set that.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.784 align:middle line:84%
Because you are
highly intellectual.

00:12:02.784 --> 00:12:05.200 align:middle line:84%
You didn't believe a lot of
this, even as it was going on.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, these
miraculous situations

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.320 align:middle line:84%
around you were
occurring constantly.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.180 align:middle line:84%
You were always
doubting everything.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.830 align:middle line:90%
You weren't like you are now.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And you started dropping
down as time went on.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the process, OK?

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So now we'll bring
you up to the time

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.445 align:middle line:84%
when you met with these
other people in London.

00:12:23.445 --> 00:12:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And you started something
called The Process.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.650 align:middle line:90%
What was the genesis of that?

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Because you were one of
the first people involved.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Yes, yes, I was
probably-- probably the first,

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:34.870 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.276 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:36.276 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
book says anyway.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.964 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.964 --> 00:12:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: It was
basically started

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.220 align:middle line:84%
by a man and a woman,
Robert and Mary Anne.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, Robert I had
known for some years

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.680 align:middle line:84%
because we had studied together
at architectural college.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.450 align:middle line:90%
He'd left architecture.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And I had continued
with architecture.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So we hadn't seen each
other for a couple of years.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.170 align:middle line:84%
He kind of phoned
me up and said,

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.930 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're starting
this new process.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.700 align:middle line:84%
We're using this
device, you know?

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.004 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of a
psychological thing.

00:13:06.004 --> 00:13:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was it kind
of a neurofeedback

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.550 align:middle line:84%
device of some kind,
or biofeedback?

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.870 align:middle line:90%
What was that device, actually?

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.354 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Well, it was
actually an E-meter.

00:13:13.354 --> 00:13:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: E-meter, OK.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Because Robert
and Mary Anne actually

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.340 align:middle line:90%
came out of Scientology.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.030 align:middle line:84%
They revolted
against Scientology

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.030 align:middle line:90%
because they felt that--

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.446 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
all rebels, yeah.

00:13:24.446 --> 00:13:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: We're all
rebels, exactly.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were using this
machine in a different way

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.960 align:middle line:90%
from the Scientology people.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.665 align:middle line:84%
Basically, Scientology
was about making everybody

00:13:35.665 --> 00:13:39.110 align:middle line:90%
like Mr. Hubbard.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: The idea--

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.533 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like in his image.

00:13:43.533 --> 00:13:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Well, yes, you know?

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.750 align:middle line:84%
The way they were planning
how to use this machine

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:51.540 align:middle line:84%
was actually to sort of program
people to be like him, yes.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:84%
We were using it
in a different way.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.277 align:middle line:84%
We were trying to find out
who we were, all right?

00:13:55.277 --> 00:13:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wonderful
machine for that.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.094 align:middle line:84%
It's basically a very
simple lie detector.

00:13:59.094 --> 00:14:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Righ, right.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.687 align:middle line:84%
So when you try to
lie to yourself,

00:14:02.687 --> 00:14:04.520 align:middle line:84%
you're calling each
other on it essentially.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Exactly, exactly.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.014 align:middle line:84%
And there were very
specific questions.

00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:09.782 align:middle line:84%
You know, what are
you here to achieve?

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And you'd find out what you're
really here to achieve and then

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.940 align:middle line:84%
how to go about it
and what's in the way.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And so through this whole
series of questions,

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:20.670 align:middle line:90%
you find out very deeply--

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so a group
emerged around this.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.412 align:middle line:90%
And you left for a while.

00:14:24.412 --> 00:14:25.370 align:middle line:90%
And then you came back.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:26.536 align:middle line:90%
And you had many adventures.

00:14:26.536 --> 00:14:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to say at
this part for our viewers

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.140 align:middle line:84%
that it's interesting the
way the book is written

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.510 align:middle line:84%
because you're paralleling
your development

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.990 align:middle line:84%
at a particular stage of
your life and the processes

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:40.340 align:middle line:84%
you were going
through with the story

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:45.390 align:middle line:84%
that Georgia is revealing
to you in a series of books

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:49.570 align:middle line:84%
about the Luciferic Rebellion
and how the species came

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:53.726 align:middle line:84%
to be so-- shall
we say-- unique.

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:84%
How the human species
came to be so unique, OK?

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And so these are two parallel
stories throughout the book.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are
points at which you

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.980 align:middle line:84%
can see almost visceral
alignments between the two

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:90%
stories.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And so now we've
got a little bit

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.480 align:middle line:84%
of an idea of who you
are, where you came from,

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.240 align:middle line:90%
your own rebellious nature.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And now let's go to the story
that's taking place parallel

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.980 align:middle line:90%
and to the Luciferic Rebellion.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And set up the story as to the
original agreements and players

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.220 align:middle line:84%
and how that came to be where
Earth was partitioned out.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Right.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.849 align:middle line:84%
This is a very, very
deep and large story,

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:33.640 align:middle line:90%
as you can imagine.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:33.965 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you have time.

00:15:33.965 --> 00:15:34.940 align:middle line:90%
We'll just start.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.010 align:middle line:84%
If we don't finish,
I'll have you back,

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.080 align:middle line:84%
and we'll do two or
three more of these, OK?

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: All right.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.233 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's just
go as far as we can.

00:15:41.233 --> 00:15:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: All right.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first
thing to understand

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.900 align:middle line:84%
is that the universe
is enormous.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.690 align:middle line:84%
It's also populated,
enormously populated.

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:57.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you could say
that it's about population.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:02.720 align:middle line:84%
In other words, planets are
made for people, all right?

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.470 align:middle line:90%
People aren't made for planets.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.450 align:middle line:90%
That's not the way around it is.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:84%
It's basically a vast
educational system,

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.400 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And one can be
educated, or one can

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.300 align:middle line:90%
be-- one can ignore all that.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And you just get another
incarnation and come around.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So this vast section, this vast
living universe is, in a sense,

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.880 align:middle line:84%
is subdivided into a series of
smaller and smaller and smaller

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.150 align:middle line:90%
units.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.590 align:middle line:84%
The smallest unit,
obviously, is one planet.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.560 align:middle line:84%
But politically,
the smallest unit

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.910 align:middle line:90%
is called a system of planets.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And a system of planets is
essentially 1,000 inhabited

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.810 align:middle line:90%
or to be inhabited planets.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.760 align:middle line:90%
So we are part of a system.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.020 align:middle line:84%
There are about 670,
maybe 700 planets

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.140 align:middle line:84%
that are currently
inhabited in our system.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.140 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.505 align:middle line:84%
Each system has to be
taken care of, obviously,

00:17:07.505 --> 00:17:09.000 align:middle line:90%
by a series of officials.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.784 align:middle line:84%
And now we're getting into sort
of the hierarchical aspects

00:17:11.784 --> 00:17:12.480 align:middle line:90%
of it all.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.119 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, the
politics of it all.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:15.349 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: The politics
of it all, yeah.

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:18.385 align:middle line:84%
So the politics of
our particular system,

00:17:18.385 --> 00:17:22.800 align:middle line:84%
right, were run by a
couple of entities.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.650 align:middle line:84%
They're called
planetary-- they're

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.380 align:middle line:84%
called system
sovereigns, all right?

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:32.560 align:middle line:84%
One was named-- I don't know
whether we can say named

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:90%
or whether we are naming.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.639 align:middle line:84%
Because in a sense,
angels don't really

00:17:37.639 --> 00:17:39.430 align:middle line:84%
need names, because
when you're telepathic,

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:40.290 align:middle line:90%
you know who you are.

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:40.740 align:middle line:90%
You know who other people are.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:45.570 align:middle line:84%
But for the sake of our
conversation, you can name it.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Lucifer
and Satan, right?

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:57.010 align:middle line:84%
These were two, basically not
that high angels, medium high,

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:90%
not the highest angels of all.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:08.930 align:middle line:84%
But after a very long time
of doing their job well--

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.350 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard
to kind of pin down

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:23.400 align:middle line:84%
exactly how it started, but
there's something very unfair

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:32.530 align:middle line:84%
about the degree of control
that we've been put under,

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.560 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.665 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you saying
we under their influence,

00:18:35.665 --> 00:18:40.870 align:middle line:84%
or prior to that influence under
the directorship or hierarchy

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.300 align:middle line:84%
of how all things,
prime directive,

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.300 align:middle line:90%
were allowed to evolve.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.954 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: It's
pretty regimented.

00:18:45.954 --> 00:18:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're saying
within the universal structure,

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:53.490 align:middle line:84%
although kind, essentially
kind and supportive--

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and I'll just paraphrase
this, because I

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.420 align:middle line:84%
know that you get to
this in the book--

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:84%
that the hierarchical
structure which

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.540 align:middle line:84%
we look at as the
prime directive-- is

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:08.200 align:middle line:84%
the term that we've put to it--
is allowed to evolve on its own

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.150 align:middle line:84%
in each place, but very
slowly, under its own steam.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere in this is where
these two entities stepped

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.310 align:middle line:84%
in, and also being
controlled at the same time,

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.270 align:middle line:84%
with no outside
interference allowed,

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:84%
which you can see
the beauty of that.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.690 align:middle line:84%
You can also see that
it's painstakingly

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:32.050 align:middle line:84%
difficult and slow for
a species to come about.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Well, it
is that exactly, yes.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, basically, it's
a sort of nested hierarchy.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:84%
So these people
aren't on their own.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:48.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're being
officiated by other entities.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:53.231 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.231 --> 00:19:55.480 align:middle line:84%
I think there's one other
thing we need to understand.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And that is what I call
the inner and the outer.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.460 align:middle line:84%
So we have the extraterrestrials
on the outer worlds.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.080 align:middle line:84%
These are the worlds that
we can see and touch.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.360 align:middle line:84%
But the inner worlds are
the worlds of the angels,

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.840 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously,
extraterrestrials

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:11.634 align:middle line:90%
have angels, too.

00:20:11.634 --> 00:20:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: We're all in a sense.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
multidimensional, yes.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:14.795 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah.

00:20:14.795 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you like, the guidance is
coming through from the inside

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.190 align:middle line:84%
and being expressed
on the outside.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:23.204 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:23.204 --> 00:20:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: So we're somebody
else's extraterrestrials

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:26.360 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.068 align:middle line:84%
We're another planet's
extraterrestrials.

00:20:28.068 --> 00:20:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: So once we've got
that sort of understanding,

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.715 align:middle line:84%
that is being sort of
guided from the inside

00:20:35.715 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:84%
and expressed on the outside,
the lack of free choices,

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.930 align:middle line:84%
I think that was probably the
thing that drove the rebellion.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:90%
We need to have more freedom.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in a sense, it's
not dissimilar to what

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.300 align:middle line:84%
we've experienced on
this planet in the last,

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.790 align:middle line:84%
let's say, 2,000
years, where we're

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:03.190 align:middle line:84%
getting progressively more
individuated, progressively

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:08.540 align:middle line:84%
more expected of us in
terms of responsibility.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Because when we
were children, we

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:19.299 align:middle line:84%
were taken care of as
children, as a-- a race

00:21:19.299 --> 00:21:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: We are--

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:21.155 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: A child race.

00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA:
--theoretically, becoming

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.106 align:middle line:84%
more mature and more
sovereign, even though we still

00:21:24.106 --> 00:21:26.490 align:middle line:84%
have control structures
that are more

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.470 align:middle line:84%
manipulative and
subconscious at this point.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Exactly.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:29.950 align:middle line:90%
We're emerging out of that.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yes, we are.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.990 align:middle line:84%
So at this time-- so, Lucifer
and Satan, you're saying,

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.710 align:middle line:84%
felt there was an unfairness
in the existing hierarchy that

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.090 align:middle line:84%
didn't allow for a little
more free will and a little

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:43.275 align:middle line:90%
more assistance.

00:21:43.275 --> 00:21:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Correct.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: OK, so let's
pick it up from there.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: So they
basically say, OK.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:54.520 align:middle line:84%
They start a
revolution, essentially.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, they have, as I
said, 600, 700 planets

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.940 align:middle line:90%
under their control, all right?

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Each planet is basically
taken care of by, again,

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:07.020 align:middle line:84%
a couple of angels, not that
high, but planetary princes,

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:07.943 align:middle line:90%
they're called.

00:22:07.943 --> 00:22:10.610 align:middle line:84%
They managed-- Lucifer
and Satan managed

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:16.480 align:middle line:84%
to convince only 37 planets
out of this vast-- I mean, not

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.366 align:middle line:90%
vast, but there's 800 planets.

00:22:19.366 --> 00:22:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So there wasn't a
very large number.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.953 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: So we're breaking
with prime directive,

00:22:22.953 --> 00:22:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and we are going to exert
our influence in terms

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.320 align:middle line:84%
of influencing this
free will on our part,

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.080 align:middle line:84%
on theirs, on
everybody's part, right?

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And see what that
experiment looks like.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Exactly,
exactly, exactly.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: OK.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: But we've
got some problems.

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Because the planetary
princes of this planet went

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.090 align:middle line:90%
rogue essentially.

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.735 align:middle line:84%
They broke away
from the revolution

00:22:48.735 --> 00:22:51.567 align:middle line:84%
that had broken away
from the larger frame.

00:22:51.567 --> 00:22:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: OK.

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And now this is
where Caligastia--

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:55.853 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: This is where
Caligastia comes in, yeah.

00:22:55.853 --> 00:22:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: So let's talk
about Caligastia and Vanu.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And explain who these
beings are and what

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.340 align:middle line:84%
happened because-- and
the areas of the world

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.560 align:middle line:90%
in which this was happening.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.735 align:middle line:90%
Because this is interesting.

00:23:07.735 --> 00:23:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah, it seems the
Middle East seems to draw--

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:12.702 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: The Middle East, yes.

00:23:12.702 --> 00:23:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Hot bed.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: All right, so
half a million years ago,

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.210 align:middle line:84%
we get the first of
the interventions

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.172 align:middle line:90%
from the inner worlds, right?

00:23:24.172 --> 00:23:27.805 align:middle line:90%


00:23:27.805 --> 00:23:33.730 align:middle line:84%
This is Caligastia and his--
essentially his aide de camp,

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:39.940 align:middle line:84%
basically, and 100--
now this is fascinating,

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:45.910 align:middle line:84%
100-- mortals from
another world, all right?

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:90%
They die.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:51.010 align:middle line:84%
They go up through the dimension
worlds, up through the bardos,

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:55.600 align:middle line:84%
if you like, to the capital
planet of this system,

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.940 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:84%
They then volunteer to come down
to another primitive planet--

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:07.600 align:middle line:84%
this one-- as
instructors, basically.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:12.322 align:middle line:84%
So they are given
these beautiful bodies.

00:24:12.322 --> 00:24:13.535 align:middle line:90%
They're made for them.

00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: They were
engineered, so to speak.

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah, engineered, yes.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: The perfected
human form, much taller.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Tallish, but also,
interestingly enough, they

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:35.100 align:middle line:84%
were fashioned from biological
material from entities-- oh,

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:40.400 align:middle line:84%
not entities-- men and women
they had called in, humans.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Humans.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Right

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Right.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:43.859 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: So they used
that genetic principle.

00:24:43.859 --> 00:24:45.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: But it was enhanced.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: But enhanced.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:46.535 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yes.

00:24:46.535 --> 00:24:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: And they enhanced also
the person who gave them the--

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.386 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yes.

00:24:53.386 --> 00:24:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: I guess
you'd call it--

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: Was it--
kind of quid pro quo.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:57.665 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yes.

00:24:57.665 --> 00:24:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.778 align:middle line:84%
And they were here
for a long time.

00:24:59.778 --> 00:25:02.290 align:middle line:84%
It'll be here for years
and years, you know?

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:03.230 align:middle line:90%
Hundreds and hundreds.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So they were--
basically their bodies

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.520 align:middle line:90%
were pretty much immortal.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.205 align:middle line:90%
That was 500,000 years ago.

00:25:09.205 --> 00:25:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: So they had
a means of maintaining

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.990 align:middle line:84%
their immortality through
the consumption, as I recall,

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:15.449 align:middle line:90%
of a certain shrub.

00:25:15.449 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: It was a shrub.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:24.560 align:middle line:84%
But it had to be coordinated
with information, energy,

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.640 align:middle line:84%
a particular kind
of energy coming in.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: I think
information's a fair word, yes.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.730 align:middle line:84%
But when the revolution
happened, if you like,

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.590 align:middle line:90%
that energy was cut off, right?

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:46.480 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, these guys, these
100 or 200, they would die.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: They would
become mortal, yes.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE:
Horrifyingly, you know?

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Right.

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:54.135 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: But here we get the
sort of the Anunnaki and the--

00:25:54.135 --> 00:25:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: I was just
going to bring that up.

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Because now these
time frames are

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.855 align:middle line:84%
overlaying with the work of
Sitchin, Michael Tellinger, who

00:26:01.855 --> 00:26:04.970 align:middle line:84%
has picked up on that thread,
and others, around 400,000

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:08.330 align:middle line:84%
years ago, the insertion of
the Anunnaki as this very

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:11.860 align:middle line:84%
large and more perfected race
who had also been involved

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:16.930 align:middle line:84%
in genetic engineering with the
local DNA in a particular area

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:18.920 align:middle line:90%
that was more in South Africa.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: I think that Sitchin,
who basically pulls off

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:30.050 align:middle line:84%
the material,
translates the material,

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:40.020 align:middle line:84%
I think he is actually
reinterpreting the prince's

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:90%
mission.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: That could well be.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:45.110 align:middle line:84%
So are you saying that you
think the Anunnaki were

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:47.820 align:middle line:90%
some of those representatives?

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.754 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yes, yes, I do.

00:26:49.754 --> 00:26:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: And so these are-- if
you look at Barbara Hand Clow's

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:84%
work, these are beings
that have been working

00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:00.290 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth dimensional
realm into the earthly realm,

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and continue to work in the
fourth dimensional realm, which

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:06.840 align:middle line:84%
is very much more easily
accessible into our dimension

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.250 align:middle line:84%
in working with the
human population.

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:13.032 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of interesting.

00:27:13.032 --> 00:27:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: I don't know.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:18.172 align:middle line:84%
I make a point of trying not to
read too much of other people's

00:27:18.172 --> 00:27:19.630 align:middle line:84%
work which is very
similar to mine.

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: So you can
stay very clean, yeah.

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.275 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: I try
to keep it clean.

00:27:22.275 --> 00:27:23.150 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know that.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: So we have
Caligastia and we have Vanu.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, tell us who
these two beings are

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.540 align:middle line:84%
and where the divide
in their efforts

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.800 align:middle line:84%
started taking place
in their beliefs.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Because as I understand,
Vanu was a loyalist

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:42.730 align:middle line:84%
to the great hierarchy and
also to the prime directive.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yes.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: But there
were changes there, too.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yes.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.770 align:middle line:84%
When the revolution broke
out, basically, everybody

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:51.720 align:middle line:90%
was given a choice.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.261 align:middle line:84%
Do you wan to go
with the revolution?

00:27:53.261 --> 00:27:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to go
with what I call

00:27:55.870 --> 00:28:00.980 align:middle line:84%
MA, multiverse
administration, basically.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:03.940 align:middle line:90%
It was an administrative issue.

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:10.476 align:middle line:84%
And 60 of the 100 of
the prince's staff

00:28:10.476 --> 00:28:13.132 align:middle line:84%
decided to go with the
revolution, all right?

00:28:13.132 --> 00:28:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And 40 decided to stay faithful
and loyal to MA, all right?

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:20.740 align:middle line:90%
They are removed.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:84%
They're taken off, except
for these two, Vanu

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and his-- basically--
his clone contributor.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And they basically form-- they
say that they're here basically

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.690 align:middle line:84%
to keep the light of
truth burning, you know?

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yes.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.687 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Because the other side
go crazy, really go bananas.

00:28:44.687 --> 00:28:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: So they're off.

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And that group,
under him, of humans

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.350 align:middle line:84%
begins developing closer
to the prime directive,

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.000 align:middle line:90%
for a good long while anyway.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.625 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah.

00:28:54.625 --> 00:28:55.760 align:middle line:90%
It gets a little distorted.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.984 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: Slow, steady,
and then distortions.

00:28:57.984 --> 00:28:59.400 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about what happened

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:04.222 align:middle line:84%
to the group that
became us more or less.

00:29:04.222 --> 00:29:06.612 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: It's rather
kind of difficult to know

00:29:06.612 --> 00:29:07.950 align:middle line:90%
who us is at this point.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:09.241 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Well, yeah, exactly.

00:29:09.241 --> 00:29:10.124 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't-- yeah.

00:29:10.124 --> 00:29:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Well,
these two groups--

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:16.190 align:middle line:84%
so basically, we get Caligastia
in the Middle East and North

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.500 align:middle line:90%
Africa.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:21.560 align:middle line:84%
He basically kind of
takes over that area.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Vanu-- or Van
actually is his name.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.920 align:middle line:90%
I changed it.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: OK.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: I don't want
to get slapped around

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.920 align:middle line:90%
by him when I die.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: Right,
OK, Van, all right.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: He basically
takes the few loyalists,

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:39.620 align:middle line:84%
and they-- human
loyalists-- from the city,

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:44.060 align:middle line:84%
basically, that they had
developed on the peninsula

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:44.980 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.167 align:middle line:90%
It's under water now.

00:29:46.167 --> 00:29:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: We'll talk about
Dalamatia in a moment.

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:49.333 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah, Dalamatia.

00:29:49.333 --> 00:29:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And he then sets out across--
he goes east and then sort of

00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:01.320 align:middle line:84%
across the desert and down
the Black Sea and then

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:11.140 align:middle line:84%
through North India, and then
right away across to China.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yes.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:12.912 align:middle line:90%
So he's headed east.

00:30:12.912 --> 00:30:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: So he's here.

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And they lay, sort
of, all these areas

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:21.210 align:middle line:84%
different little
collectives along they way,

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:25.520 align:middle line:84%
basically seeding, if you
like, the culture with the what

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:29.120 align:middle line:84%
you call the prime direction,
with the thought of the way

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:29.640 align:middle line:90%
things are.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yes.

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: And that's the group
that basically moved down

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:41.630 align:middle line:90%
through-- through the East.

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And then they take off for
the islands of Lemuria.

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's the group that
basically starts the Lemurian

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.130 align:middle line:90%
society.

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: OK, so we
have seeded Lemuria,

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:57.390 align:middle line:84%
which was a very high
and more advanced

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:00.040 align:middle line:84%
civilization in its
understanding spiritually.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go back to what was
happening in the Middle East

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.980 align:middle line:84%
and what was happening
under Caligastia.

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, Caligastia basically--
it's awfully hard

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:15.960 align:middle line:84%
to sort of exactly
try to understand

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.200 align:middle line:90%
what his motives really were.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it looked
to me, you know,

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.289 align:middle line:84%
somebody who sort of completely
dominates a society--

00:31:23.289 --> 00:31:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Oh, yes.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.121 align:middle line:90%
I see what you're saying.

00:31:25.121 --> 00:31:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, of course, he
appeared to go out of balance

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:30.390 align:middle line:84%
very quickly with
that amount of power.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And since he rebelled,
it's like, hey, we've

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:33.706 align:middle line:84%
already done it,
so what the heck?

00:31:33.706 --> 00:31:34.975 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what we can do here.

00:31:34.975 --> 00:31:35.975 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Exactly, yeah.

00:31:35.975 --> 00:31:36.641 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yeah.

00:31:36.641 --> 00:31:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- I found
it very interesting,

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:44.090 align:middle line:84%
because that
culture-- let's talk

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:45.680 align:middle line:90%
about what Dalamatia was like.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Because though there was
very advanced culture

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.300 align:middle line:90%
in certain ways--

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Oh, it was.

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: --very
advanced cultures.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Under their tutelage
and understanding,

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.190 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
imbue the human species

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:56.900 align:middle line:84%
with these much
higher understandings.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And we've read about the
enlightened civilizations

00:31:59.280 --> 00:31:59.780 align:middle line:90%
of the past.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.482 align:middle line:84%
But Dalamatia is not one
we normally hear about.

00:32:02.482 --> 00:32:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us about
the characteristics

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.080 align:middle line:90%
of that culture?

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.090 align:middle line:10%
>>WYLLIE: Yes.

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:09.190 align:middle line:10%
When we say it was very
advanced, of course,

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:12.125 align:middle line:10%
we think advanced, we think of
machines and things like that.

00:32:12.125 --> 00:32:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yes.

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: But this is
advance of a different kind.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yes.

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: You know,
they were happy people.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.531 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: Happy, and
also, they understood

00:32:18.531 --> 00:32:21.656 align:middle line:84%
the more technologies of the
spirited mind much better.

00:32:21.656 --> 00:32:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah, they were
well adjusted in a sense.

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yes.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Simple buildings--
The staff would telepathically

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:39.870 align:middle line:84%
draw in members of the tribes
around who could listen.

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:40.964 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I can't remember.

00:32:40.964 --> 00:32:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I think it's in the
first volume there's

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.479 align:middle line:90%
quite an elaborate story of--

00:32:44.479 --> 00:32:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: There's
an elaborate story

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.570 align:middle line:84%
in this one also
of one of the women

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.410 align:middle line:84%
that they drew in
from the local people.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Exactly.

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Because the local
people, of course,

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:57.025 align:middle line:84%
would be afraid of
somebody who had qualities

00:32:57.025 --> 00:32:58.470 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't
possess, somebody

00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:59.890 align:middle line:84%
who, for instance
is a dreamer, whom--

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: A dreamer, yes.

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: --they
would be terrified of.

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: Well, and there were
also ships coming and going

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:05.830 align:middle line:84%
still, as I understand,
in the book at this time.

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.290 align:middle line:84%
There were physical
manifestations

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:10.130 align:middle line:84%
of higher, more advanced
extraterrestrial cultures.

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:13.160 align:middle line:84%
These beings were tall--
taller and more perfected

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and considered almost
godlike in their own way.

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds as though that
frightened the native people

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:20.890 align:middle line:90%
that were living in that region.

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So there were bridges
made between the people

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.870 align:middle line:84%
of that region who came in
with them, telepathically

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.520 align:middle line:84%
were drawn there through
the dream time and so forth

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.260 align:middle line:90%
to work with.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.886 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Yes, yes,
yes yes, well put.

00:33:32.886 --> 00:33:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yes.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah,
there was much more

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:40.000 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial involvement
before the revolution.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Because after the
revolution, of course,

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.410 align:middle line:90%
we were basically isolated.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.570 align:middle line:90%
They were told, keep away.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
whole group of angels

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:51.220 align:middle line:84%
whose job it is basically
to tell extraterrestrials,

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.220 align:middle line:90%
leave this planet alone.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Well, they haven't.

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:54.740 align:middle line:90%
But go ahead, yeah.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Well, compared to most
planets, they have, actually.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:58.425 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: OK, OK.

00:33:58.425 --> 00:33:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: We've been
pretty isolated.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:00.628 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: I'm not
saying-- I mean,

00:34:00.628 --> 00:34:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I think these
visitations have been

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:04.784 align:middle line:84%
both for the
benefit of humankind

00:34:04.784 --> 00:34:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes not
for the benefit.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.450 align:middle line:90%
There's all kinds of activity.

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:09.480 align:middle line:90%
This is an interesting planet.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:14.239 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Well, it is, and yes,
of course, the most interesting

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:17.580 align:middle line:84%
planet, for some very
interesting and significant

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.489 align:middle line:90%
reasons, yes.

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: So when Dalamatia
was essentially-- well,

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.639 align:middle line:84%
it went under, right,
through cataclysm.

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:27.045 align:middle line:90%
It experienced a cataclysm.

00:34:27.045 --> 00:34:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah.

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:30.922 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: And at this time,
had they already started--

00:34:30.922 --> 00:34:33.780 align:middle line:84%
was it after that time
where the whole notion

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.210 align:middle line:84%
of weaponry and
advanced technologies

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:38.877 align:middle line:84%
was seeded into the
human population?

00:34:38.877 --> 00:34:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yes.

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:40.918 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: And this
is really where

00:34:40.918 --> 00:34:43.290 align:middle line:90%
the story starts going south.

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:47.159 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Well, yeah, with a,
you know, really going south.

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: And so that's where
Caligastia's ego started--

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.900 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like some
sort of egoic structure.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.614 align:middle line:84%
Although, you say,
and Georgia says

00:34:54.614 --> 00:34:56.989 align:middle line:84%
something very interesting in
your book about that later.

00:34:56.989 --> 00:34:59.280 align:middle line:84%
But let's say the egoic
structure's at work.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
create a species that

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:02.932 align:middle line:84%
knows how to compete
with each other.

00:35:02.932 --> 00:35:04.390 align:middle line:84%
That seemed to be
the big thing was

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:06.050 align:middle line:84%
to create the notion
of competition.

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Oh, how
interesting, yes.

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: And then
start building, yes,

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and using the technology to
sort of one up each other

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.160 align:middle line:84%
to create a more advanced
species within the human

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.190 align:middle line:90%
through competition.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yes.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Caligastia's
principle was

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.150 align:middle line:84%
divide and conquer,
which is basically

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:31.570 align:middle line:84%
a way of accelerating
evolution, in an odd sense.

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
divide people, you

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.210 align:middle line:90%
set people against each other.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: Creativity kicks
into motion out of competition.

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Absolutely.

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of creativity
emerges out of war, as we know.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.877 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: Yes,
that is very true.

00:35:46.877 --> 00:35:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And so what was happening
with Vanu's people

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:51.125 align:middle line:84%
on the other side,
and then into Lemuria?

00:35:51.125 --> 00:35:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Well, they were
basically out of the loop.

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Caligastia really
got quite worked up.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:02.050 align:middle line:84%
He really wanted to eliminate
Vanu completely, you know?

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:05.430 align:middle line:84%
But they could not get
across the desert, you know?

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:08.244 align:middle line:84%
If you know the
geography there, you

00:36:08.244 --> 00:36:09.785 align:middle line:84%
know that it's just
desert for miles.

00:36:09.785 --> 00:36:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yeah, it's rough.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.661 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: And they
couldn't make it across.

00:36:12.661 --> 00:36:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Right.

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So Vanu's people,
that sect of humanity,

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.650 align:middle line:90%
kept developing more slowly.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:20.704 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: More slowly,
but more principally--

00:36:20.704 --> 00:36:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: More principally.

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:23.286 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: -- in a
sense, you know?

00:36:23.286 --> 00:36:25.495 align:middle line:84%
They held to the--
the monotheistic.

00:36:25.495 --> 00:36:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yes.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.150 align:middle line:90%


00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:34.330 align:middle line:84%
That was more oriented toward
the sun and natural principles.

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Well,
that's actually--

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.230 align:middle line:84%
it's quite an
interesting process.

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:40.805 align:middle line:84%
Vanu himself was very
faithful to the invisible--

00:36:40.805 --> 00:36:45.350 align:middle line:84%
what we call the invisible
father god, all right?

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:48.990 align:middle line:10%
And the concept
of the god living

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:54.550 align:middle line:10%
in our heart, that was a very,
very deep and basic principle.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: With each with
their own connection to it.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.721 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Oh, yes,
absolutely, yes, yes.

00:36:58.721 --> 00:37:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: Which Caligastia was
trying to more or less stamp

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.160 align:middle line:84%
out and putting
himself between, as

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.550 align:middle line:90%
has been a tradition here since.

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Absolutely,
exactly, yes.

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: So Vanu's
people are still

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:11.540 align:middle line:84%
having the light of that divine
connection for themselves.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.780 align:middle line:84%
But somewhere inserted
in there was the notion

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:17.670 align:middle line:84%
that if you need something
physical as a manifestation

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:22.220 align:middle line:84%
to relate to, something
visible, then he instigated--

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Well, this
came from his assistant--

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yeah, OK.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: --who
basically said, listen,

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:33.170 align:middle line:84%
this invisible god
business is all very well,

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:36.050 align:middle line:84%
but we need something we can
get our fingers on, we can see,

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.550 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:42.700 align:middle line:84%
So that then went through
father sun, mother earth,

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.510 align:middle line:90%
or whichever way around it was.

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And that perpetuated
for quite a long time.

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:54.540 align:middle line:84%
That went into quite a
long period of the the Mu

00:37:54.540 --> 00:38:03.960 align:middle line:84%
period, which was between
about 70,000 and 35,000 years.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: So
that's-- OK, go ahead.

00:38:05.495 --> 00:38:06.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: That had to actually
move, get back to the original.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:13.092 align:middle line:90%
We had to get rid of that thing.

00:38:13.092 --> 00:38:13.896 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yes.

00:38:13.896 --> 00:38:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: That was
considerably later.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:17.012 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
very long time span

00:38:17.012 --> 00:38:18.220 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about now.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.011 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: Yes, yes,
a very long time span.

00:38:20.011 --> 00:38:22.483 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, we have the
development of the Atlantean

00:38:22.483 --> 00:38:25.790 align:middle line:84%
continent that happens
after Dalamatia goes down,

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:30.170 align:middle line:84%
which was seeded by the more
competitive Caligastian forces,

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.670 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yes, yes, yes.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:37.790 align:middle line:84%
To begin with-- it's an
interesting situation there,

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:40.736 align:middle line:84%
because, you know,
it flourished--

00:38:40.736 --> 00:38:43.896 align:middle line:84%
it started flourishing
about 16,000,

00:38:43.896 --> 00:38:47.451 align:middle line:84%
17,000 years--
BC, that's called,

00:38:47.451 --> 00:38:54.280 align:middle line:84%
BC-- with some of the
tail enders of the--

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.780 align:middle line:84%
because the islands,
the Mu islands,

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.560 align:middle line:84%
had started sinking
at that point, right?

00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.268 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Right.

00:38:58.268 --> 00:39:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of the Lemurians
were able to make it.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Well,
firstly, because they

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:06.310 align:middle line:90%
knew this was going to happen.

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yes.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:08.470 align:middle line:90%
A long period of time, too.

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:09.094 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah.

00:39:09.094 --> 00:39:11.807 align:middle line:84%
And because-- they
call it the continent,

00:39:11.807 --> 00:39:12.890 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't a continent.

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:15.390 align:middle line:84%
It was a whole series of
islands all the way up,

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:19.950 align:middle line:84%
if you like the Pacific
rim, that rim of fire there.

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:21.580 align:middle line:90%
That's where it all was, right?

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:24.268 align:middle line:90%


00:39:24.268 --> 00:39:25.800 align:middle line:90%
So-- remember where we are?

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: So then over
that long period of time,

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.650 align:middle line:84%
some of those
beings from Lemuria

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:32.749 align:middle line:84%
did make it into
the Atlantean area?

00:39:32.749 --> 00:39:33.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yes, yes.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.165 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yes.

00:39:34.165 --> 00:39:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: But you
see, the problem was

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:42.730 align:middle line:84%
that the one-- when the
Lemurians knew the disaster

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:49.919 align:middle line:84%
was imminent, they sent out all
over the world, South America,

00:39:49.919 --> 00:39:50.418 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:39:50.418 --> 00:39:52.920 align:middle line:90%


00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.880 align:middle line:90%
Not India much.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.980 align:middle line:90%


00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Not southern India,
northern India, Tibet,

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.290 align:middle line:84%
all these various
places around the world.

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:03.250 align:middle line:90%
They seeded it.

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINIA: Yes.

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And those were still those
sweeter, higher principals.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Yes, that was
the higher principle, OK?

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.030 align:middle line:84%
But when the islands
went down, there

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:17.020 align:middle line:84%
was a tremendous anger directed
towards father sun and mother

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.600 align:middle line:90%
earth for letting them down.

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.552 align:middle line:84%
So these were the ones
that arrived in Atlantis.

00:40:23.552 --> 00:40:26.135 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: Because we had higher
culture beginning to develop.

00:40:26.135 --> 00:40:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Resentful, yeah.

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.446 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINIA: And we had
a lot of weaponry.

00:40:28.446 --> 00:40:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And many books write
about, even in the Vedas,

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:35.720 align:middle line:84%
about the war between the gods
and these other individuals

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.917 align:middle line:84%
with machinery, nuclear
weaponry, and so forth.

00:40:37.917 --> 00:40:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Well, yes, yeah.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.950 align:middle line:84%
When they arrived, you
see-- 500,000 years ago,

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:44.460 align:middle line:84%
when they arrived, they had
pretty sophisticated materials.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, they had to
look at the planet.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:51.280 align:middle line:84%
So they had their ships,
their little silver ships.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's how,
for instance, Vanu

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:56.360 align:middle line:84%
knew about the islands of
Mu, because they'd seen them

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.200 align:middle line:90%
in their original geological.

00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.960 align:middle line:84%
But then, of course,
the more they

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.930 align:middle line:84%
got into being with
people, living with people,

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:07.130 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to flash
little ships around.

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:09.024 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
spook people out.

00:41:09.024 --> 00:41:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:12.192 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: You want to be as
normal as possible, you know?

00:41:12.192 --> 00:41:14.970 align:middle line:90%


00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:20.610 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, when the
fan got hit, then

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:26.940 align:middle line:84%
you got the-- they dug out the
old machinery again, you know?

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the technology
started surfacing again.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:31.190 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk a little--

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:32.232 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Quite recently.

00:41:32.232 --> 00:41:32.815 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:32.815 --> 00:41:34.995 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: I mean, 5,000,
6,000 years before Christ.

00:41:34.995 --> 00:41:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.840 align:middle line:84%
So after-- I know
that in Atlantis,

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.780 align:middle line:84%
it went down in stages as
well, or so I understand.

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.900 align:middle line:84%
It went down in
stages, three stages,

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.360 align:middle line:90%
over a long period of time.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just wrap this
historical part up.

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Because we know through
lots of different lore

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:53.490 align:middle line:84%
the people from
Atlantis went off.

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:54.830 align:middle line:90%
They went up into Britain.

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:57.650 align:middle line:84%
They ended up in Spain,
Portugal, Yucatan, all over,

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:58.240 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the
technological information

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.820 align:middle line:84%
was still encoded that we're
coming back with today.

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.260 align:middle line:84%
But now let's go back to
one of the primitive things

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.216 align:middle line:84%
happening that I
loved when I read it

00:42:08.216 --> 00:42:09.590 align:middle line:84%
because of a
personal experience.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.310 align:middle line:90%
It was the Fandors.

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what the Fandors were.

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:16.145 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to
tell a little story.

00:42:16.145 --> 00:42:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Well, the Fandors
were a passenger bird.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:24.240 align:middle line:84%
They were very large, a wingspan
about between 30 and 40 feet.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.680 align:middle line:90%
It gives you an idea of--

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In primitive
and very ancient times,

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:28.940 align:middle line:90%
these massive birds.

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Massive
birds, absolutely.

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Basically, South America-- you
know the South American birds.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.140 align:middle line:90%
But they were like dolphins.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:41.400 align:middle line:84%
They were what they would
call semi telepathic, whatever

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.210 align:middle line:90%
that means.

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: But they were fun.

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:46.564 align:middle line:90%
They were wonderful creatures.

00:42:46.564 --> 00:42:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What I
found interesting

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:51.470 align:middle line:84%
about them is they would not
allow the hybrid beings that

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:53.000 align:middle line:84%
were here, the
engineered beings,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.920 align:middle line:84%
part of Caligastia's
people, they

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.880 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't allow
them to ride them.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.680 align:middle line:84%
They would only allow
contact with humans,

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.310 align:middle line:84%
and this one in particular,
this one woman in the beginning,

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:03.940 align:middle line:90%
and others later.

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And OK, so this
is a little story.

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So many, many years
ago, when I was

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:12.640 align:middle line:84%
going through a series of--
for fun-- past life regressions

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.560 align:middle line:84%
with someone highly
skilled in that area,

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.630 align:middle line:84%
they would just--
they were basically

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:19.250 align:middle line:84%
looking to find out about
themselves, honestly,

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and just used me as
a vehicle to do that.

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So I would go into-- they'd
take me back in time.

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I went back to a very,
very, very ancient period

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.250 align:middle line:84%
of human history,
toward the beginning.

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was a young
male at the time.

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And these birds-- it
was like the Fandor,

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:40.020 align:middle line:84%
except what we
used to do then was

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.890 align:middle line:90%
we didn't ride it physically.

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:45.270 align:middle line:84%
We would telepathically project
ourselves into the bird.

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I remember we did
it for fun now and then

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.610 align:middle line:84%
with permission of the bird,
who was very telepathic.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And you could tell other
birds-- I called them--

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:54.920 align:middle line:84%
that were occupied, where
you would be flying--

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and I can still feel
everything inside

00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:01.190 align:middle line:84%
the bird and every little ruffle
of every feather and the loft

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:04.080 align:middle line:84%
and so forth-- and every now
and then when you were flying

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:06.560 align:middle line:84%
in them, you would see someone
else, another bird that

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.940 align:middle line:84%
was occupied, because they flew
in a different pattern that

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:14.020 align:middle line:84%
was more leisurely than just
to go for prey or whatnot.

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And so when I came back
from that regression,

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.770 align:middle line:84%
I thought, like you did, oh,
I'm making this stuff up.

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:21.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, I always thought
I was making everything up.

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.450 align:middle line:90%
I said this can't be real.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:23.270 align:middle line:90%
That was too weird.

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:25.379 align:middle line:84%
And the man said, let
me play tape for you.

00:44:25.379 --> 00:44:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was another woman
who had been there doing

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.300 align:middle line:90%
exactly the same thing.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.580 align:middle line:90%
So I got a little validation.

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Then when I read
this in your book,

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:37.342 align:middle line:84%
I thought, yes, these
beautiful creatures did exist.

00:44:37.342 --> 00:44:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And we use to interface
with them, probably all

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:39.925 align:middle line:90%
over the world.

00:44:39.925 --> 00:44:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Because I experienced that
as a Lemurian existence.

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Ah, right, yes.

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:47.240 align:middle line:84%
There weren't that
many of them, you know?

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:51.530 align:middle line:84%
They weren't in a big crowd,
unlike humans or anything

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:52.420 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Fairly selective, but
very, very, honorable.

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very honorable, yes.

00:44:57.370 --> 00:45:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: And shy, you know,
in the way that they would be,

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.980 align:middle line:84%
very cautious about
living, having anything

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:03.847 align:middle line:90%
to do with people.

00:45:03.847 --> 00:45:05.597 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, there
had to be agreement.

00:45:05.597 --> 00:45:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah, that first one.

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Because they were big.

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:13.841 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
attractive looking birds.

00:45:13.841 --> 00:45:14.382 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:45:14.382 --> 00:45:16.529 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: They weren't the
most beautiful of birds.

00:45:16.529 --> 00:45:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the
interesting thing

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:21.380 align:middle line:84%
is when I was looking at
them in the experience I had,

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:24.570 align:middle line:84%
it was before-- either I
was colorblind personally

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:28.400 align:middle line:84%
or it was before the development
of color in human eyesight.

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole environment
was shades of sepia.

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:34.280 align:middle line:84%
The water was kind
of a deeper brown.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:35.590 align:middle line:90%
The sky was beige.

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:39.000 align:middle line:84%
The grasses and everything
was kind of brown.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And it had a little
tinge of purple.

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:44.510 align:middle line:84%
So that would mean to me it was
the very beginning of eyesight,

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:47.190 align:middle line:84%
at least for me, in
that the infusion of red

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:49.404 align:middle line:84%
was coming into the
sepia to create a purple.

00:45:49.404 --> 00:45:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Right.

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:52.153 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they weren't
really purple, probably.

00:45:52.153 --> 00:45:53.335 align:middle line:90%
But that's all I could see.

00:45:53.335 --> 00:45:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah.

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it was
an amazing experience

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:56.660 align:middle line:90%
to have gone through.

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was more real
than this reality now.

00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Well, exactly.

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is what
you're talking about.

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.818 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Exactly, what I had
in the near death experience.

00:46:03.818 --> 00:46:06.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what's
so astonishing about it.

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:11.140 align:middle line:84%
We think this is real, but
this is really just a shadow.

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a shadow.

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:15.700 align:middle line:84%
This is forgettable oftentimes,
where those experiences are not

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:16.380 align:middle line:90%
forgettable.

00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And they're more
visceral, obviously.

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Oh, yes, yes, yes.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so now--

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: And also, they
communicate on many levels

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:25.640 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So one is not just
getting an idea.

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:30.410 align:middle line:84%
One's getting the
whole, as you said,

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:32.677 align:middle line:84%
the whole visceral
feeling of the idea.

00:46:32.677 --> 00:46:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: It's much more total.

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:37.460 align:middle line:84%
One brings much more of
oneself to the party.

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:41.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I want to talk
about another realm that

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:44.170 align:middle line:84%
permeates this story
all the way through.

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I found that the way
that you and Georgia delineated

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.730 align:middle line:84%
the angelic realm
was fascinating.

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
subject of midwayers.

00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:52.184 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Right, yes.

00:46:52.184 --> 00:46:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, how did midwayers
play into this whole thing?

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.377 align:middle line:84%
Because they have a
distinctly different job.

00:46:57.377 --> 00:46:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into
a really personal experience

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:01.830 align:middle line:84%
with you and a midwayer
in a little bit.

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:03.970 align:middle line:90%
But tell us what midwayers are.

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:04.762 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah.

00:47:04.762 --> 00:47:07.155 align:middle line:84%
Well, midwayers were
created at the time

00:47:07.155 --> 00:47:11.830 align:middle line:84%
of the arrival of the prince's
staff 500,000 years ago.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:16.633 align:middle line:84%
They were actually-- they
weren't the physical creations

00:47:16.633 --> 00:47:18.780 align:middle line:84%
of the prince's
staff, but they were

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:22.197 align:middle line:84%
the emotional, spiritual
creations, if you like.

00:47:22.197 --> 00:47:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
closest in vibration

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.550 align:middle line:84%
into-- to be able to reach
into the human realm?

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah.

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:30.330 align:middle line:84%
You see, the problems
the angels have

00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:34.880 align:middle line:84%
is that they don't
really sink low enough

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:39.880 align:middle line:84%
to understand the human
issues and human problems.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:43.560 align:middle line:84%
This is both a problem,
you know, if you like,

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.670 align:middle line:84%
but also they have to train
angels pretty carefully

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:49.220 align:middle line:90%
to able to handle people.

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Midwayers, as the
title suggests,

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:57.457 align:middle line:84%
they draw their
existence midway--

00:47:57.457 --> 00:47:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Between
the two realms, yes.

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Yes, between the
level of the angels and humans.

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.516 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they're closer to
humans than the angels, right?

00:48:03.516 --> 00:48:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.461 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Well, one
has to understand

00:48:05.461 --> 00:48:09.377 align:middle line:84%
the stacked nature of
the universe, right?

00:48:09.377 --> 00:48:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: It isn't
just that way.

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:12.689 align:middle line:90%
It's this way as well.

00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.222 align:middle line:84%
And vibrationally,
stepping down.

00:48:15.222 --> 00:48:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yes, exactly.

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.638 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
the midwayer would

00:48:17.638 --> 00:48:19.450 align:middle line:90%
be just slightly off phase.

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:21.790 align:middle line:84%
But also those are
the ones we can often

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:23.930 align:middle line:84%
see when you're doing
something and you

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:27.340 align:middle line:84%
see someone kind of walk through
out of the corner of the eye.

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: They can make
themselves visible.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.846 align:middle line:84%
They can also interact with this
really, which angels can't, you

00:48:32.846 --> 00:48:33.345 align:middle line:90%
see.

00:48:33.345 --> 00:48:36.115 align:middle line:84%
Most people say,
oh, the Anunnaki

00:48:36.115 --> 00:48:40.762 align:middle line:84%
were saying we're the result of
angels and humans, you know--

00:48:40.762 --> 00:48:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mating.

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Mating.

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Angels can't do that.

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:44.033 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They can't do that.

00:48:44.033 --> 00:48:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: No they can't do that.

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No..

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: They're completely
different vibrationally.

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:47.436 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:47.436 --> 00:48:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
more-- just staying

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:53.490 align:middle line:84%
on that topic for one moment--
more a matter of the beings

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:54.990 align:middle line:84%
that had been
perfected or developed

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:57.870 align:middle line:84%
to come in to do whatever
they were doing at that time,

00:48:57.870 --> 00:49:00.640 align:middle line:84%
those humans, that
perfected human form,

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.910 align:middle line:84%
mating with the indigenous
human at that time.

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's more of what--
that's kind of where we are.

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Exactly.

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:10.180 align:middle line:84%
That whole Anunnaki and
everything came from there.

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:11.555 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah.

00:49:11.555 --> 00:49:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
the-- so the midwayers

00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:17.880 align:middle line:84%
can intervene in extreme
circumstances, where

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.730 align:middle line:84%
someone like Georgia
may not intervene.

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:23.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Georgia can't even
impose on your thoughts

00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:25.500 align:middle line:90%
without an invitation.

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:26.982 align:middle line:90%
So that's a much--

00:49:26.982 --> 00:49:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: She couldn't
read my thoughts--

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She couldn't read
your thoughts without your--

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: --until I allowed her
to kind of normally do that,

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:33.720 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.178 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So her--
it's interesting

00:49:35.178 --> 00:49:38.500 align:middle line:84%
because as she's writing,
she's writing her observations

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:41.316 align:middle line:84%
as your companion
here that guides you

00:49:41.316 --> 00:49:42.190 align:middle line:90%
throughout your life.

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:43.374 align:middle line:90%
But she can't intervene.

00:49:43.374 --> 00:49:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Right.

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.706 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But now
let's talk about where

00:49:45.706 --> 00:49:48.460 align:middle line:84%
your midwayers-- some midwayers
intervened on your behalf.

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.520 align:middle line:90%
It's so lovely.

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's an interesting
story during that car accident.

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what happened,
because that was weird.

00:49:56.550 --> 00:49:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah, it was.

00:49:57.690 --> 00:50:00.959 align:middle line:90%


00:50:00.959 --> 00:50:03.120 align:middle line:84%
I was living with a
girlfriend, right?

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:05.666 align:middle line:90%
But I was out with another girl.

00:50:05.666 --> 00:50:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you did a
little bit of that in your life

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:08.580 align:middle line:90%
when you were young.

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:09.050 align:middle line:90%
Out and about.

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:10.425 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: I was
a little naughty.

00:50:10.425 --> 00:50:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I was 18, 17 and a 1/2
or something like that.

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:15.601 align:middle line:84%
And I had my car, my new
little car, a Deux Chevaux.

00:50:15.601 --> 00:50:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Deux Chevaux,
a tiny little thing.

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Tiny little thing.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.778 align:middle line:84%
And if anyone knows
a Deux Chevaux,

00:50:19.778 --> 00:50:21.290 align:middle line:90%
it's basically made of crap.

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:23.031 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
totally horrible.

00:50:23.031 --> 00:50:23.780 align:middle line:90%
It's like rolling.

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:25.821 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: The interesting
thing is their windows,

00:50:25.821 --> 00:50:27.770 align:middle line:90%
right, are half.

00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:30.165 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom half
swings like that.

00:50:30.165 --> 00:50:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And they're tiny.

00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: They're tiny,
yes, about that high.

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right, yeah.

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:35.271 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: So here we are.

00:50:35.271 --> 00:50:36.360 align:middle line:90%
We're going along.

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:40.750 align:middle line:84%
My girlfriend's-- like that--
We're go over around the hill.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going down
the hill, and there's

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:47.106 align:middle line:90%
a woman in a station wagon.

00:50:47.106 --> 00:50:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And she's trying to
decide whether she should

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:50.936 align:middle line:84%
try and cross in
front of me or not.

00:50:50.936 --> 00:50:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm about halfway
down the hill,

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:55.856 align:middle line:84%
and the damn women
starts moving, all right?

00:50:55.856 --> 00:50:57.080 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And what the hell
am I going to do?

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:00.800 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm 17.

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't know driving.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.754 align:middle line:90%
You know, Deux Chevaux--

00:51:03.754 --> 00:51:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:06.290 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a
lot of protection

00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:07.230 align:middle line:90%
in that little beast.

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: No, not a
lot of protection.

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:10.220 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So I decide to accelerate,
see if I get in front of her,

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:17.730 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to hitting her.

00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:21.630 align:middle line:84%
But as we're
passing, she tips me.

00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:23.532 align:middle line:90%
And over we go.

00:51:23.532 --> 00:51:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were going
still at a decent speed.

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:27.249 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah, 60, maybe 65.

00:51:27.249 --> 00:51:28.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to get ahead of her.

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:31.006 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: And we're going
down a hill as well.

00:51:31.006 --> 00:51:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now talk
about what happens.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:37.925 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: So next thing
I knew was I wake up.

00:51:37.925 --> 00:51:42.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm in the grass.

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:45.100 align:middle line:84%
My girlfriend is on the other
side of the car in the grass.

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:49.841 align:middle line:84%
The thing is upside down, flat,
and the wheels are going round,

00:51:49.841 --> 00:51:50.340 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: You know,
I can't believe it.

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.066 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How could that happen?

00:51:57.066 --> 00:51:57.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: How?

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those windows-- see,
that's what's so interesting.

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah.

00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:02.135 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Those are tiny--

00:52:02.135 --> 00:52:03.384 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Tiny little windows.

00:52:03.384 --> 00:52:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --little windows.

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: I know.

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you came
to understand later

00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:14.450 align:middle line:84%
that's where the genius
of the midwayers come in.

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Somehow-- I don't know
how it works either--

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:21.630 align:middle line:84%
you had been extracted
out of those little slits,

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:25.540 align:middle line:84%
each of you taken out,
put into the grass--

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Laid down.

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --laid down safely
where your car is trashed.

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.168 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Absolutely nothing.

00:52:30.168 --> 00:52:32.223 align:middle line:90%
The car is flattened.

00:52:32.223 --> 00:52:33.170 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that-- when we hear
about these kinds of miracles

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.320 align:middle line:84%
in life-- and we
do hear about them.

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.778 align:middle line:84%
You can go online and probably
pull up 1,000 this afternoon

00:52:40.778 --> 00:52:43.860 align:middle line:84%
if we were choosing to
research-- this is often

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:47.490 align:middle line:84%
the work of that realm of angels
who can come into our density

00:52:47.490 --> 00:52:50.307 align:middle line:84%
and do what we would
consider miracles, right?

00:52:50.307 --> 00:52:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yes.

00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think the question
I've asked myself, of course,

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:55.640 align:middle line:90%
is, why me, you know?

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:58.625 align:middle line:84%
Why did we get pulled
out, whereas other people

00:52:58.625 --> 00:53:00.250 align:middle line:84%
have crashed and
didn't get pulled out.

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: And the
answer was, of course,

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:02.840 align:middle line:90%
that it wasn't your time yet.

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It wasn't
your time, yeah.

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: And there's something
very profound in that,

00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:06.370 align:middle line:90%
isn't there?

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:09.410 align:middle line:84%
The idea that we
don't die until we've

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:11.794 align:middle line:90%
done what we're meant to do.

00:53:11.794 --> 00:53:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And if we do die
prematurely, then we're

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:15.126 align:middle line:84%
going to have to do
it next time around.

00:53:15.126 --> 00:53:15.904 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:15.904 --> 00:53:17.320 align:middle line:84%
No, I find that
quite interesting,

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:19.960 align:middle line:84%
because we all have such
a great fear of death.

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the species does
everything to avoid death.

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I've come to look
at it that we have an expiration

00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:26.940 align:middle line:90%
date from the moment we're born.

00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going to go, no
matter how crazy things look,

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:31.130 align:middle line:90%
until that time comes.

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And when that time comes, we're
going to go, no matter what.

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:36.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I have another
little story for you

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:37.560 align:middle line:90%
on the midwayer front.

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.160 align:middle line:84%
So my husband, Scott,
was with his friend,

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:43.180 align:middle line:84%
the same age you
were, 18 years old.

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:46.590 align:middle line:84%
He was on the back of his best
friend's motorcycle in England.

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were on a dual
carriage way, on the motorway.

00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And before they took off on
that trip, for some reason,

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Scott said, you know, James,
I think we need to have a map.

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:58.920 align:middle line:90%
He went back into the house.

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.080 align:middle line:90%
And there wasn't a map.

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.082 align:middle line:90%
He found this big book.

00:54:02.082 --> 00:54:03.790 align:middle line:84%
This is totally out
of character for him.

00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:05.410 align:middle line:90%
He knows his way around.

00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:09.160 align:middle line:84%
He took out this atlas,
stuffed the atlas

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:12.680 align:middle line:84%
down the front of his leather
jacket into his pants.

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So when the accident happened,
his friend was essentially

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:20.499 align:middle line:84%
cut in half and died
of a driver, you know?

00:54:20.499 --> 00:54:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: It's hard not to
die when you're cut in half.

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:23.582 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:54:23.582 --> 00:54:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And Scott was thrown
off gently to the side,

00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:31.990 align:middle line:84%
had a little fracture in
the wrist, unconscious.

00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Hit-- the book had been hit.

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:36.380 align:middle line:90%
The book saved his life.

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:39.530 align:middle line:84%
He was basically unconscious,
woke up in the hospital

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:42.450 align:middle line:90%
and said, what room is James in?

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:43.324 align:middle line:90%
God, that was weird.

00:54:43.324 --> 00:54:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And had no idea, of
course, what had happened,

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:50.330 align:middle line:84%
but that-- and then later
had a very beautiful

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:52.350 align:middle line:84%
intuitive reading
in which they said,

00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:53.990 align:middle line:84%
it was your friend's
time and not yours

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted you, his
best friend, with him

00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:57.450 align:middle line:90%
during this experience.

00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And it released
him of that guilt.

00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:00.789 align:middle line:84%
Like, why did he--
why did this happen?

00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:02.080 align:middle line:90%
You could look at it logically.

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:04.288 align:middle line:84%
The guy in the front usually
goes down with the bike.

00:55:04.288 --> 00:55:07.770 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, that was a
very extraordinary version also,

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:09.615 align:middle line:84%
I think, of midwayers
coming in to help out.

00:55:09.615 --> 00:55:11.281 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Yes, that's
a wonderful story,

00:55:11.281 --> 00:55:13.150 align:middle line:90%
yes, absolutely.

00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now,
I wanted to ask you

00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:18.550 align:middle line:84%
about dolphins and
whales on this planet.

00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Because throughout the
history of Atlantis,

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:26.160 align:middle line:84%
the history of Lemuria, and to
this day, dolphins and whales

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.612 align:middle line:90%
and their connection play in.

00:55:28.612 --> 00:55:30.570 align:middle line:84%
They play a very important
part on this planet.

00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And I love that
part of the book.

00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yes.

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Georgia tells a story of how,
at one point in the Atlantean

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:49.530 align:middle line:84%
disaster, the dolphins
took Atlanteans,

00:55:49.530 --> 00:55:54.520 align:middle line:84%
selected Atlanteans,
down to the South Pole,

00:55:54.520 --> 00:56:00.450 align:middle line:84%
where they were building
another alternative to the--

00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Culture.

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah, which
fell apart later on.

00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:07.350 align:middle line:84%
But the dolphins were very
much involved with that.

00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:10.347 align:middle line:84%
They carried the
people on their backs.

00:56:10.347 --> 00:56:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
have the connection

00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:14.880 align:middle line:90%
with Sirius, as I recall, right?

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yes, yes, yes.

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Whether all dolphins do or
whether selected dolphins--

00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:21.550 align:middle line:84%
I suspect it's
selected dolphins--

00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:28.050 align:middle line:84%
a very complex relationship with
Sirius in which they believe

00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:36.430 align:middle line:84%
that they are the third of the
four delineations of culture--

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:37.284 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:37.284 --> 00:56:38.964 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: --they're
the third, Nommo.

00:56:38.964 --> 00:56:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And isn't
it interesting

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:42.732 align:middle line:84%
that humans have almost
a universal love--

00:56:42.732 --> 00:56:45.190 align:middle line:84%
except for some people that
make their money in the fishing

00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:48.870 align:middle line:84%
industry-- have a universal
love of these grand creatures

00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:49.620 align:middle line:90%
of the ocean?

00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:51.161 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Oh, it's
impossible not to.

00:56:51.161 --> 00:56:53.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one would have to
be really blinded not to.

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:54.920 align:middle line:90%
They're adorable.

00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:55.774 align:middle line:90%
They're wondeful.

00:56:55.774 --> 00:56:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:57.981 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of
compassion and heart

00:56:57.981 --> 00:56:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and how they even work
with healing people.

00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:02.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we're coming to
the end of this conversation.

00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And I want to bring up the
point that Georgia brought in,

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:12.910 align:middle line:84%
which is that there came--
Georgia's observation, who

00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:18.820 align:middle line:84%
followed in the rebellion--
that being was part of that

00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and had regrets later-- that
maybe there was a plan that

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:31.490 align:middle line:84%
essentially was put into
motion before Lucifer

00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and Caligastia even made
their appearance into this,

00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:38.920 align:middle line:84%
that maybe it was even
part of a more divine plan,

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:43.450 align:middle line:84%
that this breakaway
civilization, so to speak,

00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:45.100 align:middle line:90%
occurred.

00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:46.570 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know
for what reason.

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And just tell me your
thoughts on that.

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.570 align:middle line:90%
What you gathered from that.

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:51.736 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Well, this
is very, very arcane.

00:57:51.736 --> 00:57:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And I almost don't want to
say it, it's so delicate.

00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:02.660 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that
a new mutation,

00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:11.406 align:middle line:84%
a mutation of angel
and human was basically

00:58:11.406 --> 00:58:14.350 align:middle line:90%
planned from the beginning.

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And the Lucifer,
that whole stage,

00:58:20.370 --> 00:58:21.807 align:middle line:90%
was in a sense, part of that--

00:58:21.807 --> 00:58:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were manipulated.

00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: --was acted out, yes.

00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Because you know the
whole world is a stage.

00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:29.026 align:middle line:90%
The whole universe is a stage.

00:58:29.026 --> 00:58:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:30.691 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: You know?

00:58:30.691 --> 00:58:32.610 align:middle line:90%
We're all working this out.

00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:33.610 align:middle line:90%
We're all playing parts.

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
may have just been

00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:37.484 align:middle line:84%
pawns to a larger
directive themselves.

00:58:37.484 --> 00:58:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Yeah, pawns
of pawns of pawns.

00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So meanwhile, I have
to say, now, you in this story,

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:44.390 align:middle line:84%
meanwhile, as this is
going on and these stories

00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:45.920 align:middle line:84%
are paralleling,
we kind of skewed

00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:47.860 align:middle line:84%
toward the side of
Georgia's information.

00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:52.570 align:middle line:84%
But you were with this
group called The Process.

00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And you continued on for
a long period of time.

00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And this book leaves
off where you guys

00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:58.330 align:middle line:84%
went on all these
wild adventures.

00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:00.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we're
quitting civilization.

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.670 align:middle line:90%
We're quitting society.

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:02.920 align:middle line:90%
We're going to live the truth.

00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of you
are all sell-outs.

00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:06.860 align:middle line:84%
We're moving to the
Bahamas together.

00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:09.530 align:middle line:90%
That worked for a little while.

00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:11.845 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Only to
find somewhere,

00:59:11.845 --> 00:59:13.699 align:middle line:84%
an island where we
could be on our own.

00:59:13.699 --> 00:59:15.365 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, away
from civilization.

00:59:15.365 --> 00:59:16.574 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Totally away, yeah.

00:59:16.574 --> 00:59:18.656 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you did
it for a little bit there

00:59:18.656 --> 00:59:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and then said, no, no,
we're getting the call.

00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Now we're going to Mexico.

00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:26.080 align:middle line:84%
So you end up in
Mexico in this old,

00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:29.470 align:middle line:84%
dilapidated out of nowhere,
eating, as I recall--

00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:33.351 align:middle line:84%
what was it?-- prickly pears
and one other fruit, coconuts.

00:59:33.351 --> 00:59:35.726 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Coconuts and prickly
pears were pretty much it.

00:59:35.726 --> 00:59:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You had a diet of
that because you had no money.

00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:39.390 align:middle line:84%
By this time, you
guys had no money,

00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:40.730 align:middle line:90%
no connection with culture.

00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:42.210 align:middle line:84%
You had the clothes
on your back.

00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And you end up in this
dilapidated salt factory

00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:49.018 align:middle line:90%
somewhere in Mexico, right?

00:59:49.018 --> 00:59:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: Yucatan.

00:59:49.830 --> 00:59:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the Yucatan,
yes, in the Yucatan.

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of just
left me hanging there,

00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:58.110 align:middle line:84%
because I haven't read
the follow up book to it.

00:59:58.110 --> 01:00:01.810 align:middle line:84%
But as I understand, that
didn't last too long.

01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:03.390 align:middle line:90%
You had some intervention.

01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:05.399 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Well, you
see, it's like you

01:00:05.399 --> 01:00:07.440 align:middle line:84%
have to come down off the
mountain at some point.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.648 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, we had an intervention.

01:00:08.648 --> 01:00:10.930 align:middle line:10%
We were, I think,
probably nine months

01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:16.547 align:middle line:10%
to a year before the storm hit.

01:00:16.547 --> 01:00:17.380 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Hurricane.

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.740 align:middle line:10%
>>WYLLIE: Hurricane, yes.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.364 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't have a lot
of shelter there to begin with.

01:00:21.364 --> 01:00:23.360 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like
to do is pick up

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:27.180 align:middle line:84%
the conversation, because
we haven't really now gotten

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:30.040 align:middle line:84%
into the development
of the modern world,

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.390 align:middle line:90%
the post Atlantean world at all.

01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And you guys are
stuck out there.

01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:36.980 align:middle line:90%
A hurricane's on its way.

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:38.540 align:middle line:90%
And life continues from there.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So we'll pick that up
in another conversation.

01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:41.370 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WYLLIE: OK.

01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's absolutely
delightful to have you here,

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Timothy.

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: It's just such a long
and immense story, you know?

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:49.987 align:middle line:84%
It seems fairly hard to
sort of encapsulate it.

01:00:49.987 --> 01:00:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're just trying
to take a tiny little slice.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost a
burden for me to ask

01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:57.290 align:middle line:84%
you to remember
what Georgia said

01:00:57.290 --> 01:00:59.465 align:middle line:90%
over the course of nine volumes.

01:00:59.465 --> 01:01:00.840 align:middle line:84%
We're just taking
a little sliver

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.370 align:middle line:84%
to give people an idea
of where all of this work

01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:04.200 align:middle line:90%
is coming from.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to thank you
for your time and your travels

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.375 align:middle line:90%
here.

01:01:07.375 --> 01:01:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WYLLIE: Wonderful, of
course, and thank you.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "Confessions
of a Rebel Angel"

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:13.080 align:middle line:84%
is both entertaining
and thought provoking.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.630 align:middle line:10%
It also has a clarity
of thought that

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:16.930 align:middle line:10%
is uncanny when
Georgia is speaking.

01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:18.920 align:middle line:10%
You can find it through
any major bookseller.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:23.060 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
