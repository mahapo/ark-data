00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.230 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
A primary focus

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.870 align:middle line:10%
with the alternative
media community

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.040 align:middle line:10%
has been to rage
against the empire.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.800 align:middle line:10%
But what if the empire
exists because of us?

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Neil Kramer says we
need to look at our part

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.870 align:middle line:90%
in the creation of empire.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:41.600 align:middle line:90%
And, it is.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.120 align:middle line:10%
I mean, whether you're
Star Warsing it or whatnot,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.010 align:middle line:10%
the notion of empire has
become increasingly daunting

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.690 align:middle line:10%
as the population at
large becomes more aware.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.567 align:middle line:84%
And we can't say
everyone, but certainly

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:56.900 align:middle line:84%
the leading edge thinkers are
becoming more aware of it.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.100 align:middle line:84%
But you have a completely
different story

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.910 align:middle line:90%
around what empire is.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.480 align:middle line:84%
So, first of all, let's launch
into your definition of what

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.690 align:middle line:84%
empire is versus
the classic kind

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:84%
of conspiratorial or new-age
community version of empire.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NEIL KRAMER: To
me, empire is better

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.090 align:middle line:10%
thought of as a
way, as an ethos,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.370 align:middle line:10%
rather than a thing
or a group of people.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.920 align:middle line:10%
And I think that
when you consider it

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:10%
as a methodology
rather than a thing,

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.190 align:middle line:10%
it leads us in sort of
healthier direction.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:84%
So I see it essentially
as something

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.830 align:middle line:84%
that happens when we start
to disown our own journey

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.130 align:middle line:90%
and our own self.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.130 align:middle line:84%
So empire is a symptom
of our disregard

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.140 align:middle line:90%
for our own spiritual journey.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And there are players in that,
and there's many different

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.775 align:middle line:84%
kinds of beings and humans
and non-physical things

00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:56.342 align:middle line:84%
and intelligences, and the
Egyptians and the Romans

00:01:56.342 --> 00:01:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and the British
and the Americans--

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going
to get into some of this

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.710 align:middle line:90%
specifically in a little bit.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Sure.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.731 align:middle line:90%
But there's many factors to it.

00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:05.200 align:middle line:84%
But the primary thing
is to understand

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:84%
that empire is a way of
doing things that takes over

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:84%
when we don't determine
that for ourselves.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.650 align:middle line:84%
So to not do it for
yourself-- that is,

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:84%
decide what you want to do
with your life and your mind

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:90%
and your heart and your spirit.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do that,
the default wiring

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.396 align:middle line:90%
is to be a subject of empire.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.200 align:middle line:84%
If you don't make choices,
someone will do it for you.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Right.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
another key factor

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.010 align:middle line:84%
in the success and the endurance
of empire is invisibility.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Mmm.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:39.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Good point.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.420 align:middle line:84%
I would say that the
invisibility of empire

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.690 align:middle line:90%
is its greatest strength.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.800 align:middle line:84%
People worry about
the technology

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.880 align:middle line:84%
that they, quote, have and
all the sort of resources

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.160 align:middle line:90%
and finances available to them.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Sacred old cryptic knowledge
and just sheer processing power

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.740 align:middle line:84%
of modern computers and
knowledge and communications

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.110 align:middle line:84%
make it seem like this
vast, incredible thing.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it is.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.605 align:middle line:84%
In my intuitive faculty,
I don't see that.

00:03:11.605 --> 00:03:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And in my knowledge, I
don't come across that.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.100 align:middle line:84%
I think empire's
rather a slender thing.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.564 align:middle line:90%
But it's invisible.

00:03:19.564 --> 00:03:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
invisible, you can

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.390 align:middle line:84%
afford to be
slender, as it were,

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.570 align:middle line:84%
because you can get
away with a lot.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.240 align:middle line:90%
People don't know it exists.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:90%
They don't see it.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So people struggle
to even approach

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:84%
the manifestation of
an invisible thing.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:84%
If we can't see it and feel
it and touch it and smell it,

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.750 align:middle line:84%
the suspicion is
it doesn't exist.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And with empire,
initially, if you're

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.380 align:middle line:84%
going at it through your
mainstream education

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.680 align:middle line:84%
and your mainstream parenting
and your mainstream workplace,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.730 align:middle line:84%
there is no such
thing as empire.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.810 align:middle line:84%
So people don't want to
approach something that's

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.350 align:middle line:84%
going to create this incredible
problem, where they're

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.231 align:middle line:84%
going to acknowledge--
some people.

00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:03.730 align:middle line:10%
Your audience is a
little different.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.410 align:middle line:10%
But in the mainstream,
for the first time,

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.700 align:middle line:10%
there are invisible
forces at play.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And conspiracy doesn't
even come into it--

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.139 align:middle line:84%
just that there are invisible
forces that shape human life.

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.680 align:middle line:84%
People don't want
to know about that.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.320 align:middle line:84%
They just want to have some
nice diversions and pleasures,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.829 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:19.579 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.325 align:middle line:90%
And that's on us.

00:04:20.325 --> 00:04:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We've checked out.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.430 align:middle line:84%
We're overwhelmed,
so we're lazy.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: That's our fault.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's our fault.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So I would
say that empire,

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.560 align:middle line:84%
if you take a really
zoomed out view of it,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.780 align:middle line:84%
you could consider it as a
magnet or an impulse-generator

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.910 align:middle line:84%
to say, if you go to sleep,
you can't do it indefinitely

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.620 align:middle line:84%
because this demon
arises, which you

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.529 align:middle line:84%
are consenting to
the existence of.

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you
look at it that way,

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.210 align:middle line:84%
there are symbols that represent
that demon, so to speak.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.475 align:middle line:84%
And there are
common symbols-- it

00:04:54.475 --> 00:04:59.120 align:middle line:84%
can be anything from the
notion of faces of stars

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.664 align:middle line:84%
to the dollar sign or the
pound symbol, or so forth.

00:05:02.664 --> 00:05:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Right.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So these exist.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.150 align:middle line:84%
But I think one of the things
that a lot of our viewers

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:84%
are aware of, or would
certainly suspect, anyway,

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.860 align:middle line:84%
is that empire actually
exists far behind the symbols.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Even the faces we
see, whether it's

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
a Rockefeller or a
Rothschild, even,

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.780 align:middle line:84%
really that's not
where empire exists.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.456 align:middle line:84%
It's something
beyond that, right?

00:05:27.456 --> 00:05:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: I think so.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.220 align:middle line:84%
I think you have to
take into account

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:84%
that there are administrators
of empire-- powerful families

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.250 align:middle line:84%
who have ushered
it into existence

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.170 align:middle line:84%
in an administrative way
through finance and the economy

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and the military
and the compulsion

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
to live in a mercantile
world, to live in a world

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.720 align:middle line:84%
where everything has to
be a product or a service,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.810 align:middle line:90%
is a method of empire.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the human
beings take care of.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
know what else to do,

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:90%
you become merely a merchant.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's this great
secret of empire.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's admissible.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not too death-defyingly
horrible to say

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.850 align:middle line:84%
I have found myself in
this life as a human being,

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.040 align:middle line:84%
parachuting into this
existence as a merchant.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.595 align:middle line:10%
It's not dreadful, and
yet it doesn't give us

00:06:20.595 --> 00:06:22.910 align:middle line:10%
any breadth to be a human being.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's the great
trick of empire.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not the
full expression

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.540 align:middle line:90%
of human being, any of it.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: No.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.670 align:middle line:90%
It's just to be a businessman.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: That's what
we're asked to be.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.018 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be a
businessman, a businesswoman

00:06:31.018 --> 00:06:32.290 align:middle line:90%
to survive and exist.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And whether you're
a painter or a poet,

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.600 align:middle line:84%
or whether you're a
plumber or an electrician,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.190 align:middle line:84%
you have to be a businessman,
otherwise you can't do it.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:46.090 align:middle line:84%
So the real esoteric angle
is that the light that

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.260 align:middle line:84%
exists in a person, the kind of
metaphysical juice, the power,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.130 align:middle line:84%
the life force, the chi,
whatever you want to call it,

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:90%
is kind of a power source.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And that can be harvested,
and it can be used,

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:90%
and it can be channeled.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.967 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the game, really.

00:07:01.967 --> 00:07:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.575 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you do
look at it as a game.

00:07:04.575 --> 00:07:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I want to go
one other place with this,

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.601 align:middle line:84%
and then I want to get
into the game of it.

00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a really
poignant aspect of the game.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still trying to get my
mind around the way you view it

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.520 align:middle line:84%
in that it almost sounds
like you're saying, because

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.050 align:middle line:84%
of our own default
position in life,

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.960 align:middle line:84%
that it's some
self-organizing thing.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.330 align:middle line:84%
But I think you could also
argue it's not self-organizing.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.540 align:middle line:84%
This is organized and
orchestrated from somewhere,

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.300 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yes.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.550 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.650 align:middle line:90%
I think it's hard to deny that.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.895 align:middle line:84%
Our greatest ways
of examining it

00:07:34.895 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:90%
is to look at Egypt and Rome.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.869 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at what was
achieved during that epoch--

00:07:41.869 --> 00:07:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about it, and do

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.060 align:middle line:84%
that overlay to what's
going on now, in empire now.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So essentially a
hierarchical distribution

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge, not based on
merit, but based on blood.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you have the
right bloodline

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and you come from the right
aristocratic-- or as we

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.850 align:middle line:84%
say today the elite
lines or families-- then

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.950 align:middle line:84%
you're given access to certain
knowledge and resources.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a parallel thing
to that, which is also

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.822 align:middle line:84%
based on hierarchy, but
it's based on merit.

00:08:11.822 --> 00:08:13.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's open to everybody.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:17.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you prove that you're
moral and ethical and strong

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.970 align:middle line:84%
and pure enough,
you are initiated

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:84%
into certain kinds
of sacred knowledge,

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:25.740 align:middle line:84%
certain kinds of information and
certain practices, physically,

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.980 align:middle line:90%
that change reality.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And that requires an
enormous responsibility.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.800 align:middle line:10%
And all the empire's
trying to do

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.189 align:middle line:10%
is sequester that old process
and have it not based on merit,

00:08:36.189 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:10%
but based on blood.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this rigorous
protection of the bloodlines

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.350 align:middle line:84%
to say this is a way that
we do it through the family.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, it lacks merits.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.720 align:middle line:90%
It lacks balance.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.390 align:middle line:84%
It lacks the cohesion
of light and dark.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And it tends to destruction,
and it tends to negativity.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So in my mystical
education, the understanding

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.820 align:middle line:84%
that destruction is a primary
force is very important.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:09.080 align:middle line:84%
But if you tip too much into
it, destruction becomes the way.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.160 align:middle line:84%
So you have a period of
creation and then a period

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:12.900 align:middle line:90%
of destruction.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:84%
You go round and
round and round.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.820 align:middle line:84%
They're missing two factors--
a bit esoteric, this,

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.640 align:middle line:84%
but-- they're missing
the time to be solid

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.250 align:middle line:90%
and the time to be yielding.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And without that, this
is what empire does.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.920 align:middle line:84%
It has 4,000 years, and then it
destroys itself and then arises

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.130 align:middle line:90%
from the ashes again.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And we're just on the
brink of that again now.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And the point for us
is that it doesn't

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.550 align:middle line:84%
have to be that way, as long
as we embody our own authority.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you look around the
streets and the schools

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.630 align:middle line:84%
and the homes, that's
not talked about.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:49.055 align:middle line:84%
People don't understand what
it is to be your own authority

00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:50.740 align:middle line:90%
or be your own person.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:90%
They don't really understand it.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is a
big responsibility.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.860 align:middle line:10%
And it's not necessarily
made to be understood

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.480 align:middle line:10%
in any of our structures
that exist from family on,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.860 align:middle line:10%
because the parents don't know.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.401 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: No.

00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, you know,
there's thought on this.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.700 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to
someone recently,

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.930 align:middle line:84%
who happens to be a friend
and an interviewee--

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.520 align:middle line:84%
which, I become friends with
a lot of the people that

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.530 align:middle line:90%
sit across from me.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying when you
look at the actual percentages

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.152 align:middle line:84%
of each-- you have a solar
system, you have a cosmos,

00:10:19.152 --> 00:10:19.860 align:middle line:90%
you have planets.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And in each planet, there
are learning opportunities.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.305 align:middle line:84%
And there's a distribution
of knowledge, so to speak.

00:10:26.305 --> 00:10:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.805 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one of
the things he was saying

00:10:28.805 --> 00:10:32.460 align:middle line:84%
was that it remains
roughly the same.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.590 align:middle line:84%
The people, for example,
watching this program

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.570 align:middle line:84%
are obviously
seekers of knowledge.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's always a percentage
of the population that

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.360 align:middle line:84%
are genuinely
seekers of knowledge.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the percentage that

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.362 align:middle line:84%
might be sitting on the
edge, toying with the idea.

00:10:46.362 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you have kind
of everybody else,

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and then those who are in
total resistance and just

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.340 align:middle line:84%
do not choose on
any level to engage.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:90%
And so can that actually shift?

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.760 align:middle line:84%
We keep saying we're going to
become more awake as a planet

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.110 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, as a species.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.490 align:middle line:84%
In your mind, what
does that look like?

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: There's a very
esoteric answer, indeed,

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.240 align:middle line:84%
to that if you want to
go down that pathway.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: All right.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:16.200 align:middle line:84%
There is the thought among
some hermetic mystical schools

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:16.700 align:middle line:90%
today--

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.283 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:17.283 --> 00:11:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --and in ages
gone by that there's always

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.997 align:middle line:84%
a very small number of ensouled
human beings on the planet.

00:11:23.997 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And the rest of the
people here are thought forms,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.670 align:middle line:84%
or, as they say in other
areas, tulpas-- T-U-L-P-A.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And that those thought forms
have their own existence

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.550 align:middle line:84%
and have being and have
sentience and have a right

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.450 align:middle line:90%
to life just like anyone else.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:42.000 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have the soul
lineage that some people do.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a different kind of man,
a different kind of human.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And earth school, as
you kind of infer,

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.707 align:middle line:84%
is a specific lesson
in resolving polarity.

00:11:53.707 --> 00:11:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:56.123 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: That the whole
reason we come here

00:11:56.123 --> 00:11:58.750 align:middle line:10%
is to seek resolution
of polarity

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:10%
through a thing we call
spiritual development.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And all the actors and
all the theatrical players

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and the stage and the
audience is all artificial,

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.251 align:middle line:90%
rather like this set up here.

00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Rather like
our politics today--

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.685 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Rather like politics.

00:12:11.685 --> 00:12:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that makes
the news like ISIS.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Well, the
politics is artificial,

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.870 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't
help us very much.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.905 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: This is
artificial, but it helps us

00:12:17.905 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:84%
because it gives a focal
point and we can distribute

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.130 align:middle line:84%
some conscious media in
a specific kind of way.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: What people
don't like to hear

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of
the stuff is unreal.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So rather than saying empire and
new world order and the elites

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:39.820 align:middle line:84%
and the Illuminati-- I
just call it unreality.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's a statement, then,
that's rather neutral.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:47.090 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have that kind
of melodramatic negativity

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:47.890 align:middle line:90%
associated with it.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:49.223 align:middle line:90%
It's something rather different.

00:12:49.223 --> 00:12:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you consider
it as unreal,

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.890 align:middle line:84%
you're then moving into
much healthier territory

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:84%
of the examination of maya--
that all of the objects

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.560 align:middle line:90%
don't really exist.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And some of the people
don't really exist.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.207 align:middle line:90%
That's a healthy territory.

00:13:02.207 --> 00:13:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It actually
is, even if it's

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.050 align:middle line:84%
hard to get one's mind
around that notion.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.080 align:middle line:84%
If you go with that
kind of precept,

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.740 align:middle line:84%
it does make life
a little easier

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:10.470 align:middle line:90%
to navigate in that sense.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.136 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: It's more
philosophical rather

00:13:12.136 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:90%
than combative.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And I did a show recently
with Nigel Taylor.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know him at all,

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.130 align:middle line:84%
but that was the nature of
that conversation, which

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.390 align:middle line:90%
is this is an illusion.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at it
from even Tom Campbell's

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.534 align:middle line:84%
point of view, the
theory of everything--

00:13:26.534 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: He's a good bloke.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Isn't he wonderful?

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: He's good, yeah.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:31.186 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as
he's saying, this

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:33.940 align:middle line:84%
is a collectively
rendered reality

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.420 align:middle line:90%
that we have all agreed upon.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:35.506 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:13:35.506 --> 00:13:35.770 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.353 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've
agreed this crystal is

00:13:37.353 --> 00:13:38.816 align:middle line:90%
this crystal, for example.

00:13:38.816 --> 00:13:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what you
just said makes a lot of sense

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.160 align:middle line:90%
within the context of that.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It does.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.220 align:middle line:90%
We've created an enemy.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.680 align:middle line:90%
It has its own creation as well.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And as I said earlier,
there are very

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:84%
esoteric Christian
and Gnostic and Taoist

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:59.260 align:middle line:84%
and esoteric Sufi myths
and legends and stories

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.110 align:middle line:84%
and-- let's use a
better word-- histories

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.970 align:middle line:84%
that say some of the
beings responsible

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.300 align:middle line:84%
here created this
place in error,

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and the error is embedded
into all the forms-- into me

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and you and all the
things around us.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the
beauty of this earth school,

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.100 align:middle line:84%
is that that error is
inherently magnetizing us

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.862 align:middle line:84%
towards the resolution
of polarity.

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if-- we'll
speak a little flippantly

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.240 align:middle line:84%
for a moment-- as
if God is seeing

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.790 align:middle line:84%
one of his wayward angels
create this solar system,

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and make a mistake,
and get it wrong

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.157 align:middle line:84%
and create shame and horror
and injustice and imperfection.

00:14:39.157 --> 00:14:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Really that's the
word-- imperfection.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And rather than just erase it
and rub it out from existence,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.280 align:middle line:84%
the big guy sat back and
thought, you know what?

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.010 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
really interesting,

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:52.320 align:middle line:84%
because everyone that
goes there comes out

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:84%
with this super ninja
spiritual juju which we've not

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.930 align:middle line:84%
seen anywhere else
in the system.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to keep that error
in the construction of Earth

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.250 align:middle line:90%
and see how people deal with it.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and that's
the basis of the Urantia work

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:08.410 align:middle line:90%
to a large extent, too--

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:09.076 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Right.

00:15:09.076 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --is understanding
that beings in other domains

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.170 align:middle line:84%
look at this experiment,
so to speak--

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.086 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: And go, wow.

00:15:16.086 --> 00:15:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and
say, competition?

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:18.880 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Look what competition
does to the human being,

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.050 align:middle line:90%
for good-- better or for worse.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.070 align:middle line:90%
Look at what it does.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And any species that can
survive in an environment

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.990 align:middle line:84%
of competition and polarity
has probably the most

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:84%
profound learning
of any possibility

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:36.050 align:middle line:90%
within the universe.

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.296 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It does.

00:15:36.296 --> 00:15:37.837 align:middle line:84%
Because first you
have to survive it,

00:15:37.837 --> 00:15:39.987 align:middle line:84%
and then, more so, you
have to resolve it.

00:15:39.987 --> 00:15:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: You can't
just keep surviving it.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.420 align:middle line:84%
You have to come to a point
where there's a resolution,

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and that is a
spiritual question that

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.795 align:middle line:84%
encompasses philosophy and
psychology and metaphysics

00:15:49.795 --> 00:15:51.330 align:middle line:90%
and all those lovely things.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
examine the phenomena.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:57.565 align:middle line:84%
So it's part of spiritual
life to look at empire.

00:15:57.565 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:84%
If you don't,
you're missing out.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.120 align:middle line:84%
You can't just eat salad and
do Qigong or whatever things.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:90%
I enjoy thatm and I enjoy that.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.850 align:middle line:84%
But the shadow work
puts us in touch

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.957 align:middle line:84%
with the very root
of what this is.

00:16:09.957 --> 00:16:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.914 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So you have to have
a very healthy and balanced

00:16:12.914 --> 00:16:15.490 align:middle line:84%
attitude about bringing
both of them into life.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just an
abstract thing out there.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.434 align:middle line:84%
It's what's happening in
the home and in the kitchen

00:16:20.434 --> 00:16:22.350 align:middle line:84%
and in the bedroom and
in the bathroom, right?

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:22.933 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:22.933 --> 00:16:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: It's really super
intimate, this shadow.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.010 align:middle line:90%
Empire is in the home.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And we reflect that
throughout our lives,

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.225 align:middle line:84%
and then we pass that on to our
children who reflect that out

00:16:32.225 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:90%
through their lives.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: We do.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:34.051 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:34.051 --> 00:16:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So one thing about
the illusion is--

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.490 align:middle line:84%
and you mentioned
it a moment ago.

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.970 align:middle line:84%
It is, essentially, a game that
we have to learn to navigate.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:45.504 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
strikes me about anything

00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:47.170 align:middle line:84%
having to do with
game-- I automatically

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:50.480 align:middle line:84%
go to the notion or
metaphor of a chess board.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you have the
queen and the king

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and the knights and
the power players.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:84%
But in reality,
it's often the pawns

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.300 align:middle line:84%
that determine the
outcome of a game.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And if we are the pawns, how can
we-- you see what I'm saying?--

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.190 align:middle line:84%
use our own presence on the
planet by sheer strength

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:11.630 align:middle line:90%
of numbers to change the game?

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Good question.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:14.339 align:middle line:90%
Really, really good question.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:19.060 align:middle line:84%
The pawns do determine the
whole flow of the game.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So those opening
moves or whatever--

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:22.315 align:middle line:84%
you know, two squares
here and this guy

00:17:22.315 --> 00:17:23.480 align:middle line:90%
and this guy and this guy.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Before any knights or
any rooks or whatever

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.820 align:middle line:84%
start to zip around the
board, those pawns radically

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.340 align:middle line:84%
affect the nature of the
campaign, of the conflict,

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:34.840 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:35.423 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:35.423 --> 00:17:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So if you realize
your power as a pawn

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.280 align:middle line:84%
and you're not looking behind
you thinking, oh, well,

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.388 align:middle line:84%
it's the queen
with all the power.

00:17:43.388 --> 00:17:44.846 align:middle line:84%
That's an ironic
statement, really,

00:17:44.846 --> 00:17:46.160 align:middle line:90%
isn't it, where I come from.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:46.868 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGH]

00:17:46.868 --> 00:17:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: But if you're tempted
to think that we're just

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:53.770 align:middle line:84%
these little things that get
zapped in the campaign, but no.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you're of equal
value to everything else.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.927 align:middle line:84%
But it's how you
consider yourself.

00:17:58.927 --> 00:18:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at some
chess games online--

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.785 align:middle line:84%
I remember watching
a Garry Kasparov

00:18:02.785 --> 00:18:08.370 align:middle line:84%
thing live with Nigel Short
many years ago in the '90s.

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.300 align:middle line:84%
It was the pawns
chasing each other

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.209 align:middle line:84%
around the board that was
the most exciting thing

00:18:13.209 --> 00:18:14.250 align:middle line:90%
of this whole tournament.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:14.833 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:14.833 --> 00:18:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And they totally
determined the outcome.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was a lovely lesson
in precisely what you're just

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.850 align:middle line:84%
talking about, which is to
understand the king, in a way,

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.190 align:middle line:84%
is the weakest
piece on the board.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.555 align:middle line:84%
The queen has the greatest
breadth of movement.

00:18:29.555 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And yet,
it's completely

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.044 align:middle line:84%
determined by the
front line, right?

00:18:34.044 --> 00:18:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:35.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my son was teaching
me a play the other day,

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.510 align:middle line:84%
or a couple weeks ago, which
is checkmate in three moves.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.810 align:middle line:90%
But it's all about the pawns.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah, it is.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's all
about the pawns.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it
only works on someone

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.530 align:middle line:84%
that's never heard of
that particular move.

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It does.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:47.880 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It works
perfectly then.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.947 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: You're waiting for
that mistake so you can play

00:18:50.947 --> 00:18:51.446 align:middle line:90%
your--

00:18:51.446 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just
execute those,

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.452 align:middle line:90%
and it's pretty much checkmate.

00:18:54.452 --> 00:18:56.826 align:middle line:84%
And I thought-- and that's
what made me think of it, too.

00:18:56.826 --> 00:18:57.620 align:middle line:90%
It was so powerful.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.078 align:middle line:84%
But it was just the movement
of the pawns-- clever movement

00:19:00.078 --> 00:19:01.070 align:middle line:90%
of the pawns.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And what you just said
a moment ago-- the queen

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.820 align:middle line:90%
has the breadth of movement.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.190 align:middle line:10%
Well, how does the
feminine now start

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:12.160 align:middle line:10%
flowing into the
conversation of empire,

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.230 align:middle line:10%
and essentially
transcending empire?

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:18.925 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a very
male-dominant paradigm.

00:19:18.925 --> 00:19:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.470 align:middle line:84%
The key for women is
not to be like men.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.940 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGH] It's a very simple
statement, that, but--

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please, continue.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.526 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: In the business
world, where I spent many years,

00:19:28.526 --> 00:19:30.830 align:middle line:84%
the successful women
had to be like men.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And they had to play with the
men and dress like the men

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:35.996 align:middle line:84%
and smell like the men
and walk like the men

00:19:35.996 --> 00:19:36.870 align:middle line:90%
and drive men's cars.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, unfortunately.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: I know.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.380 align:middle line:90%
It's very unpleasant.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think as there is
with men at the moment,

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.120 align:middle line:84%
there's an identity
crisis amongst a lot

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:52.770 align:middle line:84%
of female philosophers and
metaphysicians and healers

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:53.980 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.891 align:middle line:84%
Where if you go to
the places where

00:19:55.891 --> 00:20:01.215 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of speakers
and a lot of people who

00:20:01.215 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
are prepared to get up on a
stage, grab the microphone,

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and orate and talk and
deliver a kind of monologue,

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.360 align:middle line:84%
there aren't many
women who do that.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.940 align:middle line:90%
Women work in a different way.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:11.900 align:middle line:90%
They do it in groups.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.180 align:middle line:84%
They want to do
one-to-one a lot.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.350 align:middle line:84%
There's a different
kind of presence

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.830 align:middle line:84%
with that, which isn't catered
for in the male-dominated

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.600 align:middle line:90%
mercantile world.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is not.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So you have
to create the very space

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.790 align:middle line:84%
that a woman is
going to operate in.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.580 align:middle line:90%
Women have to create that space.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Don't go and compete
on the men's stage,

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.490 align:middle line:84%
because that's rubbish
anyway, quite frankly.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:35.470 align:middle line:84%
So the healthiest
things I've seen

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:38.331 align:middle line:84%
is where groups get together
and they have male groups

00:20:38.331 --> 00:20:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and they have female
groups and they have,

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:40.740 align:middle line:90%
like-- whatever you call it.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.510 align:middle line:90%
Coed groups?

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Is that the phrase here?

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And everybody learns
something specific.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And actually it's the men's
groups and the women's groups

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.260 align:middle line:84%
where we actually
begin to identify

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.470 align:middle line:90%
some of the challenges.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Men will say things to
men that they'll never

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.415 align:middle line:84%
say to women-- even conscious,
spiritually-tuned men.

00:20:57.415 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:59.998 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And women,
it's the same thing.

00:20:59.998 --> 00:21:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, the mixed groups,
where everybody's together,

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.600 align:middle line:84%
then start to really
do something important.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:09.910 align:middle line:84%
Because you realize that the
push of the sun through a man

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:84%
is very important, and the pull
of the lunar through a woman

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:90%
is very important.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's an
electromagnetic universe.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Without
those two polarities,

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.740 align:middle line:90%
you cannot resolve polarity.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So you have to map
them in the extreme.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And a man and a
woman are delivered

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.236 align:middle line:84%
to specifically address
that navigational procedure.

00:21:28.236 --> 00:21:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
live with them forever,

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.520 align:middle line:84%
and it's not your soulmate
or your great lover in life,

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.440 align:middle line:90%
necessarily.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.580 align:middle line:90%
It could be a friend.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:35.730 align:middle line:90%
It could be a colleague.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.280 align:middle line:90%
It's always a series of people.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.970 align:middle line:90%
It's never one person.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:43.060 align:middle line:10%
But the opposite feminine
or masculine flow--

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.330 align:middle line:10%
usually embodied in the
opposite gender, not always,

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:51.020 align:middle line:10%
but usually-- can show you blind
spots that cannot be seen any

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:51.910 align:middle line:10%
other way.

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.380 align:middle line:90%
You cannot do it on your own.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.950 align:middle line:90%
You need the opposites.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And spiritual people often
find I get on with women very,

00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.920 align:middle line:90%
very well.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And the women say, that's funny,
because I get on with men very,

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.550 align:middle line:90%
very well.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And what they're doing is
they're fulfilling themselves

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.520 align:middle line:84%
through the examination
of that alternative flow

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.040 align:middle line:90%
through the opposite gender.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.680 align:middle line:10%
And it's a spiritual
collaboration,

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.820 align:middle line:10%
and it has to be
absolutely seated

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.420 align:middle line:10%
in the roots of nature,
which is not represented

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.220 align:middle line:10%
in the commercial world at all.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So you have to move
away from that.

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
world at large at all.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.185 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:22:25.185 --> 00:22:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: The world at
large is a commercial world.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:27.313 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:27.313 --> 00:22:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So we have to step
away and say to ourselves,

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.230 align:middle line:90%
we're not merchants.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:32.390 align:middle line:90%
We're not traders.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.340 align:middle line:84%
You may choose to do that,
but that's not our call.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Our call is beings of pioneering
spirit, of exploration,

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:44.840 align:middle line:84%
of color, of texture,
of velocity, of depth.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.000 align:middle line:90%
And that has to be expressed.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.030 align:middle line:84%
There's not sufficient
bandwidth or latitude

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.870 align:middle line:90%
to express that as a trader.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
system asks us to do.

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.520 align:middle line:90%
Success is in trade.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.340 align:middle line:90%
And that's not the human way.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.360 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.205 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
where it is-- we've

00:23:03.205 --> 00:23:04.830 align:middle line:84%
already talked a
little bit about where

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.690 align:middle line:84%
that is our doing
of having created

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.240 align:middle line:84%
this empire through
our own negligence,

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.250 align:middle line:90%
or just simply by default.

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
where it's not.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.196 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to
take that, then,

00:23:15.196 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:84%
back into media and a dilemma
I even have in my position

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:90%
here about this.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.170 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that a little bit.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: There's people
listening, you know? [LAUGH]

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I know.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.940 align:middle line:90%
It won't be that personal.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:31.950 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
change the paradigm,

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:33.040 align:middle line:90%
there have to be examples.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.490 align:middle line:84%
There has to be
something for people

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:35.781 align:middle line:90%
to reach out to and touch with.

00:23:35.781 --> 00:23:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully we do
some of that at GaiamTV.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:38.927 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: For sure.

00:23:38.927 --> 00:23:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But at large
there has to be that.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:44.000 align:middle line:84%
But the world is-- the
prevailing paradigm

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.140 align:middle line:84%
does not really
allow for any kind

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:49.200 align:middle line:84%
of holistic feminine
message at large.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.107 align:middle line:84%
Is that part of how
empire is created--

00:23:51.107 --> 00:23:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yes.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to keep the
keep the manipulation going

00:23:53.815 --> 00:23:56.120 align:middle line:84%
toward this very linear
way of looking at life?

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: It's to create--
ultimately, a human being is

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:03.900 align:middle line:84%
a sacred androgen, we
say in mysticism, which

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.410 align:middle line:84%
is that you are the blend
of the male and the female.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.740 align:middle line:90%
You reproduce yourself.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.370 align:middle line:84%
If you look in the
"Corpus Hermeticum,"

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:14.820 align:middle line:84%
there's this very puzzling text
about if you don't reproduce,

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.940 align:middle line:90%
you're doing it wrong.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.065 align:middle line:90%
And people think, oh, gosh.

00:24:17.065 --> 00:24:18.648 align:middle line:84%
We have to have
children, then, do we?

00:24:18.648 --> 00:24:19.740 align:middle line:90%
Is that we have to do?

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.810 align:middle line:90%
That isn't what is meant.

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:25.220 align:middle line:84%
What is meant is the spiritual
androgen recreates themself

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.550 align:middle line:90%
and gives birth to themselves.

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Right?

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:29.704 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One is one's
own soulmate, so to speak.

00:24:29.704 --> 00:24:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Right.

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.053 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And what you do is you
look for a reflection of that

00:24:33.053 --> 00:24:36.230 align:middle line:84%
in other people, and you
look for a healthy spectrum

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:39.610 align:middle line:84%
of expression in the
vigorous, in the male,

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and in the yielding,
in the female,

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and in the nourishing
of maternal and paternal

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:46.920 align:middle line:90%
in equal aspect.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.490 align:middle line:90%
And you have to have that.

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And so to generate discord and
to deplete light and hemorrhage

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:58.150 align:middle line:84%
this essential essence
of a human being,

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:02.130 align:middle line:84%
the best way to achieve
that is to put them

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:05.060 align:middle line:90%
in doubt of their gender.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment, it's
very difficult to be a man

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.430 align:middle line:84%
and it's very difficult
to be a woman.

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the great--
kind of ontological problems

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:16.920 align:middle line:84%
with that is one
doesn't know oneself

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.200 align:middle line:84%
what it is to be a man
or a woman in these ages.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And what you have
to do, essentially--

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and I take my clients
out and do this at times,

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.695 align:middle line:84%
is take them out into the forest
and be there for a few days

00:25:29.695 --> 00:25:31.360 align:middle line:90%
and have a think about.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And for many people, it's
the very, very first time

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:37.560 align:middle line:84%
that they consider, what is
it that I'm doing being a man?

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.030 align:middle line:90%
What is my manliness?

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:42.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not just having a
beard and drinking beer

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and throwing an axe
at a piece of wood.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:48.030 align:middle line:84%
It's something rather more, you
know, complex and interesting

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:48.870 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:50.320 align:middle line:90%
But there is that, too.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.480 align:middle line:84%
There is that aggression, too,
and there is that destruction,

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.700 align:middle line:84%
too, which can be embodied
and transmuted and expressed

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:90%
in a very appropriate way.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.950 align:middle line:10%
Also, there is the
question of how

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:08.120 align:middle line:10%
does a man have a successful
relationship with a woman?

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Monogamy is kind
of not quite it.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Polygamy, or open relationships
or pansexuality-- that's

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.680 align:middle line:90%
not quite it.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.340 align:middle line:84%
So the very thing
we do, which is

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.230 align:middle line:84%
how do we relate to
each other in a loving

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.080 align:middle line:84%
and intimate and committed
and excellent way

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.260 align:middle line:84%
is a question that
people can't answer.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.940 align:middle line:90%
They'll say, I don't know.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.610 align:middle line:84%
This is what I do, and I'm
trying my best at this.

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And my energy certainly cannot
be directed to one person.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And someone else, for me--
my energies, for example,

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.990 align:middle line:84%
are much more happily
directed to one person, which

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.780 align:middle line:84%
is very happy for
my wife, of course.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:49.650 align:middle line:84%
But the nature of what it is,
the very relationship that we

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.247 align:middle line:84%
have through this thing
called marriage, for example.

00:26:52.247 --> 00:26:53.830 align:middle line:84%
If you're not married,
it's a partner.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:56.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a civil partnership.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.000 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Or it's a boyfriend
or a girlfriend.

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.359 align:middle line:84%
None of those
things are quite it.

00:27:02.359 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.358 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So not only do we
have the question of ourselves,

00:27:05.358 --> 00:27:08.120 align:middle line:84%
but the very nature of how
we relate to each other

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.674 align:middle line:90%
is very confusing for people.

00:27:09.674 --> 00:27:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're having to try to
create new language around it,

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:13.710 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:14.293 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Mmm.

00:27:14.293 --> 00:27:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And again,
I think disconnecting

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.990 align:middle line:84%
from whatever the
prevailing paradigm is seems

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:22.860 align:middle line:84%
to be really essential,
just in starting

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.870 align:middle line:84%
to regard relationships
of all kinds in a new way.

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:84%
There is no way to look at it
that's out there in the media,

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.280 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.770 align:middle line:84%
There are no larger
reflections of a new way

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:36.400 align:middle line:84%
to construct these very
personal realities at all.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And that gets me back to the
question of the manipulation,

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:42.356 align:middle line:84%
and whether it is unintentional
and happening simply

00:27:42.356 --> 00:27:44.480 align:middle line:84%
because they say, hey,
that's what the people want.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what they get.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.720 align:middle line:90%
Or whether it is intentional.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.420 align:middle line:84%
It's still keeping this
competitive, old paradigm

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:55.420 align:middle line:84%
alive within the minds of most
individuals on the planet.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.924 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to disconnect
from media right now.

00:27:57.924 --> 00:27:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It is.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:59.090 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.710 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
that many people look

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:04.800 align:middle line:84%
at the screen and the
page, and it's telling them

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.460 align:middle line:90%
this is what you do.

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle line:90%
This is how things are.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:84%
This is how you're
going to dress.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:09.756 align:middle line:84%
This is how you're
going to drive.

00:28:09.756 --> 00:28:11.380 align:middle line:84%
This is the money
you're going to have.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:11.910 align:middle line:90%
This is how you're to have--

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Constant imagery.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: This is how
you're going to eat.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:14.455 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:14.455 --> 00:28:15.030 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: This is how
you're going to have sex.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:17.990 align:middle line:84%
This is how you're
going to argue.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.930 align:middle line:90%
These are the funny things.

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are
the acceptable means

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:20.520 align:middle line:90%
of all these things.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Right.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.445 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
things you can't say,

00:28:22.445 --> 00:28:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and these are
things you can't do.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.755 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't occur to people,
as we said right at the start,

00:28:26.755 --> 00:28:30.550 align:middle line:84%
that you can dispense with all
of that and do your own thing.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:32.260 align:middle line:84%
There's absolutely
nothing stopping

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.210 align:middle line:90%
you doing your own thing.

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:37.990 align:middle line:84%
It's rather funny that many
of our big decisions in life

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.650 align:middle line:84%
end up in all these
consequences, which life really

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:44.770 align:middle line:84%
is all about-- examining the
ramifications of our choices.

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:47.590 align:middle line:84%
No one really holds a gun to
your head-- or very rarely,

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:49.930 align:middle line:84%
let's hope-- and says,
you must do this.

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:51.950 align:middle line:90%
You must have this in your life.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:53.700 align:middle line:84%
You must not have
this in your life.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:58.360 align:middle line:84%
We just do stuff and then
later on, as we acquire wisdom

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:02.215 align:middle line:84%
and as we embody a degree of
illumination in ourselves,

00:29:02.215 --> 00:29:04.590 align:middle line:84%
we look back on those decisions
and think, you know what?

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:07.695 align:middle line:84%
All my problems stem
from an ignorant decision

00:29:07.695 --> 00:29:10.330 align:middle line:84%
that I made, which was the
best I could do at the time.

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.555 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And now I have
to go back and do things--

00:29:13.555 --> 00:29:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, the
domino effect is just

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --to recalibrate,
reconfigure that.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:19.480 align:middle line:10%
Because now I wouldn't
have done it that way.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.360 align:middle line:84%
But there's a reason
that stuff happens.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And the key thing,
as ever with this,

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.410 align:middle line:84%
is to get to the
young people and say,

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:29.020 align:middle line:84%
you have complete freedom
to do whatever you want,

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.550 align:middle line:84%
however you want, whenever
you want-- complete freedom.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:35.964 align:middle line:84%
And your natural human morality
will keep you safe and sound,

00:29:35.964 --> 00:29:37.380 align:middle line:84%
and you won't want
to hurt anyone,

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.115 align:middle line:90%
do any silly things like that.

00:29:39.115 --> 00:29:43.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to pinch and
steal things from people.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Your consent to
give away your power

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:51.164 align:middle line:84%
to this thing, to this empire,
is completely optional.

00:29:51.164 --> 00:29:53.080 align:middle line:84%
No one ever holds a gun
to your head to do it.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.500 align:middle line:90%
It's completely optional.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.041 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's
what needs to be

00:29:56.041 --> 00:29:57.814 align:middle line:84%
made available, is
exactly that thinking.

00:29:57.814 --> 00:29:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It is.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.310 align:middle line:90%
And this whole--

00:29:59.310 --> 00:29:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
that's what we're

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.375 align:middle line:84%
trying to do here, but en
masse at least, do you mean?

00:30:01.375 --> 00:30:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And it's called
spiritual development.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:04.293 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:04.293 --> 00:30:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Spiritual
development disconnects you

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:10.150 align:middle line:84%
from that unhealthy,
toxic misconception.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:11.924 align:middle line:84%
And that's all it
is, a misconception.

00:30:11.924 --> 00:30:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And going back
for a moment again

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.090 align:middle line:84%
to the whole masculine-feminine
dynamic, too.

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:21.310 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I've noticed,
and I alluded to a moment ago,

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:26.440 align:middle line:84%
is in this profession--
I mean, I started out,

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.183 align:middle line:84%
I was competing in a
totally male arena.

00:30:28.183 --> 00:30:29.224 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: I bet you were.

00:30:29.224 --> 00:30:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.641 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But I didn't compete.

00:30:30.641 --> 00:30:32.750 align:middle line:84%
I chose not to compete
from the very early stages,

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:35.982 align:middle line:84%
even though I was a
sportscaster in America.

00:30:35.982 --> 00:30:36.940 align:middle line:90%
That would put you in--

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: For football
and baseball and--

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.690 align:middle line:90%
All of that.

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Goodness.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:39.640 align:middle line:90%
Goodness me.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's how
I started my career.

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And there were only
a handful of women,

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.550 align:middle line:90%
and we didn't know each other.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.730 align:middle line:84%
We were spread around,
sprinkled around the country.

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I had
to learn early on

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.560 align:middle line:84%
is I can never compete
with those guys.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.520 align:middle line:84%
That's their reality
for a lifetime.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.542 align:middle line:84%
I'm a relative
newcomer, interloper--

00:30:55.542 --> 00:30:56.750 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call it.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.635 align:middle line:84%
So I learned to
back off and tried

00:30:58.635 --> 00:31:04.560 align:middle line:84%
to learn throughout my career
where collaboration is working

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.600 align:middle line:84%
better than this kind
of competition, which

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.910 align:middle line:84%
is very difficult in the
field of television and media.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:14.950 align:middle line:84%
My observation is, even in
this whole spiritual arena,

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:16.260 align:middle line:90%
no different than elsewhere.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:16.801 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: No.

00:31:16.801 --> 00:31:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you
have the men-- and I

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.980 align:middle line:90%
interview mostly men.

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Because men will say, this
is my arrow, my focus.

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:26.330 align:middle line:90%
This is what I do.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:27.290 align:middle line:90%
This is what I know.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing here
and I am telling you

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.700 align:middle line:84%
about this as an
expert in this field.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Where the women tend to-- they
may have similar knowledge.

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.150 align:middle line:84%
But the way it's expressed
is much more diffused,

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:41.890 align:middle line:84%
which is harder to make a
coherent conversation with.

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:42.058 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Program from.

00:31:42.058 --> 00:31:42.114 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:42.114 --> 00:31:42.870 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think, why don't
I have more women on the show?

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:47.960 align:middle line:90%
It's that reason.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: That's a
lovely observation.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.376 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
brilliant women.

00:31:50.376 --> 00:31:52.020 align:middle line:90%
And, in fact, I'll turn to them.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.353 align:middle line:84%
If there's something I'm
really working through in life,

00:31:54.353 --> 00:31:55.940 align:middle line:84%
we have a very
complex way of working

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.220 align:middle line:84%
through things
that is more whole.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.304 align:middle line:84%
And they'll also
collaborate with each other.

00:32:00.304 --> 00:32:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It is.

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:02.730 align:middle line:84%
That's a lovely
observation, if I may say.

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:04.310 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely-- it's funny.

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:06.260 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about
this just the other day

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:09.290 align:middle line:84%
with a number of
excellent women who

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:11.480 align:middle line:84%
gave me the great honor
of coming to an event

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.050 align:middle line:90%
that I was hosting.

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.419 align:middle line:84%
And that very point
was made seriously.

00:32:15.419 --> 00:32:16.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm not just saying this.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.080 align:middle line:84%
But seriously it was
exactly what you just said.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.789 align:middle line:90%
And they described it like this.

00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:22.830 align:middle line:84%
They said, a man will come
and say, this is this.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: It's not
something else.

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:24.830 align:middle line:90%
This is this.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
tell you how it is.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.061 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: And I do that, because
it's part of the male energy

00:32:29.061 --> 00:32:32.420 align:middle line:10%
to do that, and to be
incisive and forthright

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:36.660 align:middle line:10%
and to nail a point
down and press it.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.290 align:middle line:10%
They said that theirs was
something rather different,

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.550 align:middle line:10%
as you say, which is they hold
a space for something to arise.

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And that-- whether it's words or
whether it's thoughts or dreams

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.959 align:middle line:84%
or language or body
movement or art--

00:32:48.959 --> 00:32:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
collaborative in nature.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: It's
collaborative in nature.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.000 align:middle line:90%
So they hold spaces.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And boy oh boy have I
learned that the hard way.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:58.860 align:middle line:84%
It's so important to
have the female energy.

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And again, I emphasize--
not always in women,

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.770 align:middle line:84%
but usually, it's so important
to have that female energy,

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:13.010 align:middle line:84%
to create spaces for nourishment
and nurturing and creativity

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:14.220 align:middle line:90%
and insight to arrive.

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.110 align:middle line:90%
Men can't do that.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:21.280 align:middle line:84%
They rely almost exclusively
on reason and on knowledge.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.285 align:middle line:84%
The woman energy
is experiential.

00:33:24.285 --> 00:33:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And in
mysticism, that's key.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So many of our great
pagan sages were women.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:35.220 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
write anything down.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.980 align:middle line:84%
They didn't care to
write anything down--

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:37.460 align:middle line:90%
And this is the problem now.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --which is kind of
cool and kind of frustrating,

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:40.290 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Because many
of the wisest people

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.110 align:middle line:84%
I've met in my life, they
never write anything down.

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:48.130 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't sit at
this table with you.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:51.840 align:middle line:84%
They just say things to people
in the world, in the sea,

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.660 align:middle line:84%
in the city, in the cafe,
in the forest, wherever,

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:55.480 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a word.

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:56.935 align:middle line:90%
It's an oral tradition.

00:33:56.935 --> 00:33:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: They never
writes it down.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Women are-- tend
to be like that.

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Not always.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a human,
beautiful, natural expression

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:10.520 align:middle line:84%
of mystical philosophy and
of spiritual investigation.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:15.600 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to package it
for a logical hour's media

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:16.277 align:middle line:90%
broadcast.

00:34:16.277 --> 00:34:17.110 align:middle line:90%
But it has to then--

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:18.929 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
understand the conundrum.

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: I
understand it for you.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:20.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.389 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Someone like
me trying to-- yeah.

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:23.440 align:middle line:90%
You see--

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:23.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Of course.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --trying to
promote the feminine essence

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:26.889 align:middle line:84%
of communication and
thought and development.

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:27.722 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Of course.

00:34:27.722 --> 00:34:29.139 align:middle line:84%
And what I've
learned is that you

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:31.763 align:middle line:84%
need women who can do that-- who
can switch that masculine dial

00:34:31.763 --> 00:34:34.060 align:middle line:84%
and do a fantastic job,
just as good as anyone else,

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:34.949 align:middle line:90%
if not better.

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:39.520 align:middle line:84%
But also, it is incumbent on the
women to create these spaces.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.250 align:middle line:84%
You can't moan about
it if you're not

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:42.500 align:middle line:90%
creating those spaces.

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So these women in question,
that I mentioned earlier,

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.170 align:middle line:84%
have started to do that
and have identified

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:50.082 align:middle line:84%
a place and a venue
and a schedule

00:34:50.082 --> 00:34:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and a way of doing
things with ceremony--

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:52.021 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, good.

00:34:52.021 --> 00:34:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.159 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --and silence
and socializing,

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:59.149 align:middle line:84%
getting together and
hanging out, and also study.

00:34:59.149 --> 00:35:00.690 align:middle line:84%
So we've got these
things-- ceremony,

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:03.069 align:middle line:90%
silence, socializing, study.

00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:04.610 align:middle line:84%
A very-- one of
them's a C, actually.

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Alliterative.

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:05.894 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yes.

00:35:05.894 --> 00:35:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:06.750 align:middle line:90%
Alliteration.

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:07.670 align:middle line:90%
That's the word.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:10.035 align:middle line:84%
It escaped me
there for a minute.

00:35:10.035 --> 00:35:12.290 align:middle line:84%
But that's a way that
they've decided to do it,

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:13.660 align:middle line:90%
to have this group.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And it works, and things
are being created.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen examples
of it in little ways,

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and now it's starting to become
medium-sized and then larger

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:21.840 align:middle line:90%
ways.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you would
have this place

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:25.247 align:middle line:84%
open to other women who
want to be part of it.

00:35:25.247 --> 00:35:25.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:26.370 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:28.572 align:middle line:84%
It, by necessity, has to
be grassroots, so to speak.

00:35:28.572 --> 00:35:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It has to be.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's go back a
little bit to empire again.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the things we
were talking about off-camera

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:38.780 align:middle line:84%
is that part of it is also
possible because women and men

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:43.630 align:middle line:84%
alike have been conditioned
to see themselves as subjects

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:45.150 align:middle line:90%
of something else--

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.025 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Absolutely.

00:35:46.025 --> 00:35:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --subject to
someone else's desires,

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.860 align:middle line:84%
someone else's rules
and regulations.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So how do you break this
subject position in life?

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: If you
consider yourself

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:01.233 align:middle line:84%
to be subject to anything
else, you are subject to it.

00:36:01.233 --> 00:36:01.816 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:01.816 --> 00:36:02.399 align:middle line:90%
Anything else.

00:36:02.399 --> 00:36:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Anything else at all.

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:07.340 align:middle line:84%
I could list 50 things,
but you get the point.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.710 align:middle line:84%
If you don't consider
yourself subject to it,

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:11.160 align:middle line:90%
then you don't have to be.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:11.860 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So one classic example
is if you use your name

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:24.000 align:middle line:84%
as a piece of transactive
business with the authorities,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.870 align:middle line:84%
you are consenting to give your
authority from you to them.

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And you've already lost it,
every time you use your name.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole
legal thing around that

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:middle line:84%
that many of my good friends
and learned colleagues

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.820 align:middle line:84%
could wax lyrical about
much better than I can.

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: But it's
a principle thing.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.020 align:middle line:90%
Your name?

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:45.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, Neil Kramer.

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Man on the
land, sovereignty things.

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:47.800 align:middle line:90%
Mmhm.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Writing?

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:49.400 align:middle line:90%
What does that make?

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:52.820 align:middle line:84%
That's an agreement, a
little fluid contract

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:55.090 align:middle line:84%
that goes out there that
says you can do business

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:57.450 align:middle line:90%
through my person.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:00.330 align:middle line:84%
One way to counter
that is to not use

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:03.330 align:middle line:84%
your name in that way anymore,
and to use it in different ways

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:04.820 align:middle line:90%
and to use a different name.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:08.049 align:middle line:90%
So I would be Neil of Portland.

00:37:08.049 --> 00:37:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:10.116 align:middle line:90%
I'm Regina of Sedona.

00:37:10.116 --> 00:37:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Regina of Sedona.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.067 align:middle line:90%
That is your name.

00:37:12.067 --> 00:37:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And not long
ago in modern history,

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:16.580 align:middle line:90%
that's how we did it.

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.460 align:middle line:84%
To use the surname is
the piece of business,

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.850 align:middle line:90%
is the transaction.

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So even when somebody-- I
got stopped the other day

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:26.720 align:middle line:84%
by a very wonderful state
trooper-- thank goodness.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.640 align:middle line:90%
And I was speeding.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.535 align:middle line:84%
And we had a lovely
conversation--

00:37:28.535 --> 00:37:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I got stopped the
other day for the same thing.

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Did you?

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was lovely.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:32.750 align:middle line:90%
His name was Officer Good.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Officer Good.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he just gave
me a warning and let me off.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: I got a warning
and he let me off as well.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: We're
just nice people.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:39.990 align:middle line:84%
But it was really
interesting, because I

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:41.500 align:middle line:84%
tried some of the
techniques out.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.291 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know,
are you Neil Kramer?

00:37:43.291 --> 00:37:45.310 align:middle line:90%
And I said, Neil.

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:47.820 align:middle line:90%
That's what they call me.

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:51.370 align:middle line:84%
The answer yes, again, is
a contract to do business

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:52.710 align:middle line:90%
and to identify myself.

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:54.376 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So by
eliminating the surname.

00:37:54.376 --> 00:37:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: By eliminating the
surname and not saying yes,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:57.960 align:middle line:90%
I said Neil.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.129 align:middle line:90%
That's what they call me.

00:37:59.129 --> 00:38:00.170 align:middle line:90%
And he just sort of went.

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:01.030 align:middle line:90%
Ha.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And he thought I was just
kind of joking, or whatever.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Being respectful, though--
not antagonizing the man.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:07.730 align:middle line:90%
But that's very important.

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:08.750 align:middle line:90%
If I'd have said, yes.

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:10.040 align:middle line:90%
I am Neil Kramer.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.420 align:middle line:84%
I am then giving my
authority, through the name,

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:16.660 align:middle line:84%
to the agent of the
empire-- who, fortunately,

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.490 align:middle line:84%
was a lovely man with
a heart and soul.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:20.790 align:middle line:90%
Goodness me, that was nice.

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And nevertheless, though,
in his capacity as an agent,

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.540 align:middle line:84%
if I give him my
authority, I then

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:29.160 align:middle line:84%
give him authority to take
away my sovereign power,

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.977 align:middle line:84%
take away my freedom,
put me in handcuffs.

00:38:30.977 --> 00:38:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Put me on the trunk
of the car, right?

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But now are you
saying this metaphorically,

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:35.080 align:middle line:90%
or are you saying this lawfully?

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:35.256 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Nope.

00:38:35.256 --> 00:38:35.610 align:middle line:90%
Literally.

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I mean, literally.

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:36.903 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Literally.

00:38:36.903 --> 00:38:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So by that language
itself in that situation,

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.217 align:middle line:84%
he would lose his
legal rights over you.

00:38:43.217 --> 00:38:44.500 align:middle line:90%
But he doesn't know that.

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: If you can't identify
that you are that person,

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:49.160 align:middle line:84%
then everything
stops at that point.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you either
acknowledge or deny it,

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:54.120 align:middle line:90%
you get into an argument.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.790 align:middle line:84%
There's ways to
do neither, which

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:57.450 align:middle line:84%
is what I was practicing
with this man.

00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And as it happened,
it had a nice outcome.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:04.960 align:middle line:84%
It's an example of using a
name not as, yeah, that's me.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.300 align:middle line:90%
I am not my name.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.900 align:middle line:84%
I am not even this
flesh and blood.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm not this bone inside.

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:12.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even this
beating heart inside.

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:14.500 align:middle line:84%
A spirit flows through
me that's not mine.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:18.170 align:middle line:84%
There's no necessity for me
to identify with that name,

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and yet the system has been
set up, as a simple thing,

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:22.560 align:middle line:90%
to use the name.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very
simple, easy example

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:29.900 align:middle line:84%
that anyone who's not familiar
with this sovereign movement

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:34.431 align:middle line:84%
of a physical flesh and
blood being completely

00:39:34.431 --> 00:39:36.805 align:middle line:84%
separate from their name can
now go and have a look at it

00:39:36.805 --> 00:39:37.730 align:middle line:90%
and investigate.

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:41.170 align:middle line:10%
Because it's very interesting--
not just the legalities of it,

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.350 align:middle line:10%
but the philosophical
implications to say,

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:48.280 align:middle line:10%
I don't need to do business with
the system through this name.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:53.100 align:middle line:84%
I can do it on my terms
without using the name.

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, getting into practical
realities of that.

00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Let's say we need to
make a living-- you know,

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.680 align:middle line:90%
the proverbial make a living.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.860 align:middle line:84%
We need money so that we can
pay our rent or buy our food.

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:11.192 align:middle line:84%
So now say maybe we don't
have a skill that we're

00:40:11.192 --> 00:40:13.160 align:middle line:84%
aware of that's unique
enough that we can

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:16.211 align:middle line:84%
be a sovereign being and command
money for our unique services,

00:40:16.211 --> 00:40:18.586 align:middle line:84%
and, in fact, have to start
somewhere under someone else.

00:40:18.586 --> 00:40:20.919 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Which is almost
everyone, including ourselves.

00:40:20.919 --> 00:40:24.000 align:middle line:84%
We have not reached that, so we
are doing other things as well.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you want
to work for someone,

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.570 align:middle line:84%
you must give them your
name and your tattoo,

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:33.340 align:middle line:84%
or, in other words, your
social security number.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:37.449 align:middle line:84%
And you are solidly in the
system just to survive.

00:40:37.449 --> 00:40:38.240 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Well, as an
example, the last time

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.790 align:middle line:84%
I came here in June,
or whenever it was,

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:45.260 align:middle line:84%
I didn't give you my name,
because my name is not

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:46.600 align:middle line:90%
Neil Kramer.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't give you my
social security number,

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:51.090 align:middle line:84%
because I don't have one--
so just as an example.

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:52.360 align:middle line:90%
That's not always the case.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:56.231 align:middle line:84%
And yet I transacted with
this organization, and you,

00:40:56.231 --> 00:40:56.980 align:middle line:90%
of course, I know.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:00.690 align:middle line:84%
But I came here and I
did things in the world,

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and I checked into a hotel,
and my name was really not

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:05.429 align:middle line:90%
used during that process.

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Did you have a credit card or
any kind of card that you used?

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: I didn't
actually, last time, no.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.187 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
able to do it.

00:41:12.187 --> 00:41:13.270 align:middle line:90%
You were going without ID.

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: I gave them a
cash bond in an envelope

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:18.184 align:middle line:84%
and said there's
the whole thing.

00:41:18.184 --> 00:41:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: If I dig into
that, I'll take it back.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't, it's,
you know, whatever.

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.190 align:middle line:84%
So there are always
ways to do it,

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:28.780 align:middle line:84%
and we call these
pathways of exemption.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And the question
is, is your pathway

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.930 align:middle line:84%
of exemption from
a law worth it?

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So if I was to
say, I'm not going

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.930 align:middle line:90%
to have a driving license.

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:38.511 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
have a passport.

00:41:38.511 --> 00:41:40.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
have a credit card.

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:42.530 align:middle line:84%
That would make my life
extremely difficult,

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and it would be
difficult to do lots

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:49.010 align:middle line:84%
of things that have great
fulfillment for me personally,

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and I believe other
people enjoy them, too.

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:54.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's not worth it.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:58.790 align:middle line:84%
But you can start with a small
little pathway of exemption

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and try out-- which is
what you've just described.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.760 align:middle line:90%
That's an example of it.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you can experiment
with larger ones.

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, being British,
I can decide lots of things

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:12.085 align:middle line:90%
about how I live here.

00:42:12.085 --> 00:42:14.870 align:middle line:84%
I can live here as
a resident alien,

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:16.315 align:middle line:84%
which is ironic
in this business.

00:42:16.315 --> 00:42:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting term.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Or I can go
through citizenship,

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:23.430 align:middle line:90%
or I can not do that.

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:26.260 align:middle line:84%
I can be here illegally
if I wanted to.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.760 align:middle line:90%
I could do that.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.920 align:middle line:84%
As it happens, I am
a resident alien.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Oregon,
there are things I

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.650 align:middle line:90%
can't do unless I'm a citizen.

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:36.930 align:middle line:84%
So I have to look
at that and think,

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:40.000 align:middle line:84%
is it worth me seeking
a pathway of exemption

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.480 align:middle line:84%
to do it in a more
sovereign way or not?

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
personal choice.

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:48.250 align:middle line:84%
So if I, for example,
wanted to carry a pistol

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:51.430 align:middle line:84%
from the shooting
range across town,

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:53.520 align:middle line:84%
I can't do that as
a resident alien.

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.060 align:middle line:90%
I would have to be a citizen.

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So I have to look
at that and think,

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.650 align:middle line:90%
do I need that piece of paper?

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Do I need to become
a citizen to do that?

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And the answer,
in my life, is no.

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.514 align:middle line:84%
It might be useful,
though, now and again, just

00:43:06.514 --> 00:43:07.430 align:middle line:90%
for practical reasons.

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I enjoy target
shooting, for example.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.770 align:middle line:84%
In America, you
have to do those.

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: You absolutely have to
be involved with these things.

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:14.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm aware of that.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:15.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's a lot of fun.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.931 align:middle line:84%
But you could make a mistake,
and then it's a felony.

00:43:17.931 --> 00:43:18.430 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: In Washington,
it's totally different.

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: It's
totally different.

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Arizona,
totally different.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Arizona, you don't
even need any paperwork.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.025 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nope.

00:43:25.025 --> 00:43:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: You can just walk
into Walmart, buy an AR-15,

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:29.517 align:middle line:90%
and walk out with it.

00:43:29.517 --> 00:43:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:33.224 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Which has its own
consequences, of course,

00:43:33.224 --> 00:43:34.640 align:middle line:84%
but it's a very
interesting thing.

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So the exemption that you
seek is very personal.

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:42.615 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it's not worth it in
a case like that, for example.

00:43:42.615 --> 00:43:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So you have to look
at it individually.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.760 align:middle line:84%
But there's always
a way out of what

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.539 align:middle line:84%
you think is the
only path, always.

00:43:49.539 --> 00:43:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:52.820 align:middle line:84%
So we'll take the
average citizen that

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.610 align:middle line:84%
was branded with
their social security

00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:59.075 align:middle line:84%
number from the age of
anywhere from, say, 2 to 15,

00:43:59.075 --> 00:44:01.790 align:middle line:84%
16, by the time they got
their driver's license.

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So they have their
social security number.

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And now they're
seeking employment,

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:07.426 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned
before, in which you

00:44:07.426 --> 00:44:10.110 align:middle line:84%
have to render that to
whoever that person is.

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Do you?

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, to get a
paycheck, for the most part.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Do you need a check?

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it
depends on whether or not

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.100 align:middle line:84%
the company is large and
willing to do it in cash or not.

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Right.

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:19.630 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:20.720 align:middle line:84%
That's a big
question, right off.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So right here,
you're saying start

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:23.005 align:middle line:90%
asking that question.

00:44:23.005 --> 00:44:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Do I want to work for a
company that requires this?

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Exactly.

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.700 align:middle line:84%
So if you go and
work for a regular,

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:33.824 align:middle line:84%
big corporate organization or
corporate-modeled organization,

00:44:33.824 --> 00:44:36.490 align:middle line:84%
they will require certain things
or you cannot even walk through

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:37.800 align:middle line:90%
the front door.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.770 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want
to do that, you

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:42.300 align:middle line:84%
could seek a pathway
of exemption.

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So I could say, for
example, I'm British.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:49.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a social--
American social security number.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I use the name Neil
Kramer to do business.

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:54.801 align:middle line:90%
And you can pay me cash.

00:44:54.801 --> 00:44:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let's
say you're an American

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:57.350 align:middle line:90%
and you already have that.

00:44:57.350 --> 00:44:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And I sit down with
the owner, and he says, OK.

00:44:59.050 --> 00:44:59.850 align:middle line:90%
We could do that.

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: If you're American,
it depends on, of course,

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.845 align:middle line:90%
the nature of the organization.

00:45:05.845 --> 00:45:07.970 align:middle line:84%
You can always sit down
with the guy and say, look.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.350 align:middle line:84%
I know that you wanted to
have these things as a company

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:11.090 align:middle line:90%
policy.

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:14.630 align:middle line:84%
But in my case, I live a
different kind of life.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to use the
social security number.

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't use credit.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't use banking
in the usual way.

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:24.600 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that I could be an
asset to this organization.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.340 align:middle line:90%
I have the skills for it.

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.740 align:middle line:84%
You can put me on
probation for six months.

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I'll prove it to
you, and you pay me

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.700 align:middle line:90%
with cash in an envelope.

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And all the taxes
are my problem.

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.320 align:middle line:84%
As long as you declare
it, that's my problem.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
worry about that.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.990 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason why a person
cannot do that-- none at all.

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:44.399 align:middle line:84%
But you have to examine
this principle in Buddhism--

00:45:44.399 --> 00:45:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How
important is it to you.

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:46.079 align:middle line:90%


00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Right livelihood is--

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:48.680 align:middle line:84%
That's where we're
going next in this.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.610 align:middle line:90%
So let's go for it.

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:51.484 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Right livelihood--
right livelihood

00:45:51.484 --> 00:45:52.430 align:middle line:90%
is very important.

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:56.370 align:middle line:84%
You can't just do a job if
you take spiritual development

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:58.340 align:middle line:84%
as a way of life, which
I have chosen to do.

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.500 align:middle line:90%
You can't just do a job.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.930 align:middle line:84%
You have to do a
good job that fits

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:06.620 align:middle line:84%
with your conscious
alignment the best you can.

00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps
refining a little bit

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit
and a little bit.

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:13.925 align:middle line:84%
If somebody were to work for
a pharmaceuticals company who

00:46:13.925 --> 00:46:18.186 align:middle line:84%
were making people
sick with bad medicine,

00:46:18.186 --> 00:46:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and torturing animals, that
would be very difficult

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:25.770 align:middle line:84%
for me to classify, in any
way, as right livelihood.

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the very basis
of what they're doing,

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:32.950 align:middle line:84%
with my consciousness, makes
it an immoral act for me.

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:35.970 align:middle line:84%
With a different kind of
consciousness, where you think,

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:42.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm helping people with oncology
and with people with dialysis

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.800 align:middle line:84%
problems with this exciting
new drug that we've done,

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and it's really good, and I
think I'm doing something good,

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and that is genuinely what
you think-- different rule.

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:51.450 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.907 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So the rules change in
relation to your consciousness.

00:46:54.907 --> 00:46:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: For me, I
determined for myself,

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.620 align:middle line:84%
my private personal
decision, to say,

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:05.770 align:middle line:84%
I will not fund systems
exclusively with my labor that

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:09.000 align:middle line:90%
destroy human expression.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.120 align:middle line:84%
So I haven't achieved
that in its entirety yet,

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.890 align:middle line:84%
but I've certainly made headway
into that over the last 10

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:18.874 align:middle line:84%
years from a position
where it was OK.

00:47:18.874 --> 00:47:19.790 align:middle line:90%
It was never terrible.

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:21.600 align:middle line:84%
It was OK, to now
it's quite good.

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Most of the fruit that I
bring to the table as it were

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.120 align:middle line:90%
is good.

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:26.980 align:middle line:90%
And I made it.

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:27.780 align:middle line:90%
I grew it.

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And I sell it,
and people buy it.

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:31.460 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes there's
no buying and selling.

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Even better when we don't
need that transaction.

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:35.710 align:middle line:90%
We don't really need it.

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:37.650 align:middle line:84%
But we still-- I'm on
the edge of the system.

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I can't really live in
a cabin in the woods,

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:41.990 align:middle line:84%
so I need a dollar
in the pocket, right?

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:44.620 align:middle line:90%
So I call that as best I can.

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:45.990 align:middle line:90%
But it's my choice.

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to do any
of it-- nobody does.

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you wake up and think,
well, hang on a minute.

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:53.210 align:middle line:90%
I've got a mortgage.

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:54.360 align:middle line:90%
I've got three kids.

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.520 align:middle line:84%
I've got a wife who
like shoes and handbags.

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.330 align:middle line:84%
What the hell am
I supposed to do?

00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:01.029 align:middle line:84%
You chose those
kids and that wife

00:48:01.029 --> 00:48:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and that situation
and that mortgage.

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
this for a while,

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.580 align:middle line:84%
because this is your choices
versus the consequences

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:10.070 align:middle line:84%
of choices and a lifelong path
that that will put you on.

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So let's speak about
that, including children.

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Every
choice is a moment

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:17.590 align:middle line:84%
of extreme radical
creation in life.

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And people
don't see that.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.610 align:middle line:84%
They think, well, I'll
just put that there

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:22.485 align:middle line:90%
or I'll put it there.

00:48:22.485 --> 00:48:23.700 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really matter.

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Every single choice is
critical-- every choice.

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:31.900 align:middle line:84%
In Mesoamerican Shamanism,
they will, for example,

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:35.780 align:middle line:84%
teach that your choice is
a mark of your character.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:39.195 align:middle line:84%
And your choice is a mark of
your honor and your integrity.

00:48:39.195 --> 00:48:41.830 align:middle line:84%
We've used that that
word today, integrity.

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:44.029 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
with somebody, you

00:48:44.029 --> 00:48:46.070 align:middle line:84%
can't just meet them in
a bar and sleep with them

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:46.770 align:middle line:90%
and walk away.

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a sign
of something negative.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:51.890 align:middle line:84%
You can't just be
with a nice person

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:54.354 align:middle line:84%
because you want
to be safe and it's

00:48:54.354 --> 00:48:55.770 align:middle line:84%
kind of what your
mom and dad did.

00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:58.710 align:middle line:84%
All those things
have consequences.

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:01.210 align:middle line:84%
So as you move into
the spiritual life,

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:04.560 align:middle line:84%
there is a greater
emphasis on what

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:06.660 align:middle line:84%
happens when you make
a choice in the world.

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Your consciousness,
when you slide it

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:10.870 align:middle line:84%
into the consciousness
of everything else,

00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:13.190 align:middle line:90%
it has a butterfly effect.

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:14.380 align:middle line:90%
You know that phenomena?

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:15.420 align:middle line:90%
It changes everything.

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:17.690 align:middle line:90%
The ripples never cease, right?

00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole of life,
in a way, if you were really

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:23.690 align:middle line:84%
to coarsely distill
it, would be to say

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:26.190 align:middle line:84%
that life is an
experiment in examining

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:28.390 align:middle line:90%
the consequences of choices.

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And every pain, every disease,
every crisis, every cataclysm

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:35.950 align:middle line:84%
is a result of choice
at a certain level.

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
make a bad choice,

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:40.710 align:middle line:84%
the payload might
not be for 25 years

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:42.240 align:middle line:84%
when it blows up
in your face, think

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do this anymore.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.230 align:middle line:90%
That's a legitimate thing.

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:46.688 align:middle line:84%
It was the best I
knew at the time.

00:49:46.688 --> 00:49:47.990 align:middle line:90%
That's a legitimate thing.

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:50.430 align:middle line:84%
The teaching in it is
how do you resolve it?

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:53.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's what you have to do--
that 25 years of consequence,

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:55.750 align:middle line:90%
you have to resolve.

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:59.230 align:middle line:84%
The next teaching is make
sure, when you make choices

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:02.870 align:middle line:84%
next time, you're very,
very lucid and very clear

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:04.080 align:middle line:90%
in what that is.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Because especially with
people and relationships,

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:13.040 align:middle line:84%
it really powerfully, profoundly
affects how you can be

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.770 align:middle line:90%
and how free you are.

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean that it's
going to make it necessarily

00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:21.159 align:middle line:90%
any easier a path.

00:50:21.159 --> 00:50:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: No.

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:21.960 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At all.

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:25.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, to be true to oneself.

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:29.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, on the deepest levels
of recognizing your own truth,

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:32.260 align:middle line:84%
whether it's-- as you say,
whether it's a choice to go

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:33.927 align:middle line:84%
home with someone
from a bar or whatnot.

00:50:33.927 --> 00:50:35.134 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Absolutely. [LAUGH]

00:50:35.134 --> 00:50:37.099 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
being conscious in each

00:50:37.099 --> 00:50:38.390 align:middle line:90%
of these choices in the moment.

00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And say you are,
and you're trying

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:42.319 align:middle line:84%
to make you feel are
heartfelt choices.

00:50:42.319 --> 00:50:42.985 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It is.

00:50:42.985 --> 00:50:43.090 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It still has its
own problematic element to it.

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It does.

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at it
from that perspective,

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:52.810 align:middle line:84%
you have to say to yourself,
when you're making a choice,

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:55.380 align:middle line:84%
is this choice aligned
with my growth,

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:57.450 align:middle line:84%
or is this choice
for my pleasure

00:50:57.450 --> 00:51:02.240 align:middle line:84%
and my diversion and
my sensual edification?

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.974 align:middle line:84%
And that's usually
a good marker.

00:51:03.974 --> 00:51:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think what I
was alluding to is

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:10.350 align:middle line:84%
there are times you make a
choice with the best mind you

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:14.080 align:middle line:84%
have, and then some
unpredictable elements

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:17.470 align:middle line:84%
should come up following that
that are quite painful, even.

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Still, there's usually a path
beyond that that is correct,

00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:24.760 align:middle line:84%
even if it's not
comfortable in the moment

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:27.229 align:middle line:84%
and you've employed your
best conscious thinking.

00:51:27.229 --> 00:51:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: There is.

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:28.130 align:middle line:90%
There is.

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Life continuity throws
dilemmas and quandaries at you

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:31.680 align:middle line:90%
and says, deal with this.

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:32.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:32.830 align:middle line:90%
You broke your leg.

00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:33.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.120 align:middle line:90%
You've gone bankrupt.

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:34.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.410 align:middle line:90%
You're getting a divorce.

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:35.909 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:35.909 --> 00:51:37.055 align:middle line:90%
You've got to go to court.

00:51:37.055 --> 00:51:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Unexpected things-- you know,
a freak car accident, where

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:42.585 align:middle line:84%
it looks like you're
guilty and everything

00:51:42.585 --> 00:51:45.000 align:middle line:90%
was totally just accidental.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.046 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the
higher level, that's

00:51:47.046 --> 00:51:48.500 align:middle line:90%
still a soul choice to me--

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --a soul choice
to say, come in and examine

00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.860 align:middle line:90%
conflict.

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Come in and examine a
root teaching of pain.

00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Why do we use pain as
an impulse for growth?

00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:59.549 align:middle line:90%
Is that necessary?

00:51:59.549 --> 00:52:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For most people, yes.

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:02.714 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: For most
people, the answer is yes.

00:52:02.714 --> 00:52:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Is it crucial as part
of the teaching of life?

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:06.122 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:52:06.122 --> 00:52:06.705 align:middle line:90%
It's optional.

00:52:06.705 --> 00:52:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:08.680 align:middle line:90%
It is optional.

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:11.220 align:middle line:84%
But that requires such
extreme responsibility

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:12.750 align:middle line:90%
on the front end.

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It does.

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.860 align:middle line:84%
You've got to load yourself
up right at the start

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.490 align:middle line:84%
and say every decision
I make profoundly

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:20.700 align:middle line:84%
shapes the whole
of reality for me.

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:22.230 align:middle line:90%
There's no little decisions.

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:23.630 align:middle line:90%
There's no whatevers.

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:26.034 align:middle line:90%
Every whatever has a payload.

00:52:26.034 --> 00:52:26.617 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:26.617 --> 00:52:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of the issue on
this planet is, in times past,

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:35.220 align:middle line:84%
in our ancient
history, we've had

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:37.515 align:middle line:84%
people who've devoted their
life to clear thinking--

00:52:37.515 --> 00:52:40.390 align:middle line:84%
much as what you're doing
in this lifetime now.

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And these people were
prominent in society.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:46.720 align:middle line:84%
The great thinkers and
contemplators and philosophers

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:49.250 align:middle line:90%
were the backbone of a culture.

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:50.210 align:middle line:90%
That's gone.

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Now we have sound bytes
from famous 23-year-olds

00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:56.990 align:middle line:84%
after they've just been admitted
to rehab for the sixth time,

00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.950 align:middle line:90%
and that's culture.

00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:58.908 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: [LAUGH] Yeah.

00:52:58.908 --> 00:53:03.237 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There is no wisdom
where the common media

00:53:03.237 --> 00:53:04.570 align:middle line:90%
attention would go, for example.

00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:06.611 align:middle line:84%
I keep using media, because
that kind of reflects

00:53:06.611 --> 00:53:08.344 align:middle line:84%
reality-- our
unreality here, now.

00:53:08.344 --> 00:53:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: It reflects
our reality, yeah.

00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:11.843 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about-- our reality.

00:53:11.843 --> 00:53:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the role of the
reemergence of the philosopher,

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:19.150 align:middle line:84%
now and into our future,
and how that will happen.

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: All a
philosopher is is

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:23.530 align:middle line:84%
somebody who values
and tries the best

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:25.990 align:middle line:90%
to embody wisdom in life.

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:28.160 align:middle line:84%
We used to have them all
over, and they were simply

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.092 align:middle line:90%
called wise elders.

00:53:29.092 --> 00:53:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And they were
in every community.

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And particularly from
where I'm from, in Europe,

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:41.140 align:middle line:84%
I know about that in European,
English, Welsh, German,

00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:43.390 align:middle line:90%
Spanish, French history.

00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:45.790 align:middle line:90%
All communities had wise elders.

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:51.770 align:middle line:84%
That changed radically with
the arrival of mass trade.

00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And a globalization of a
trade impulse changed that.

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Because the communities
started to shape themselves.

00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Instead of small
localized entities

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:02.730 align:middle line:84%
that were loosely
networked together--

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:05.880 align:middle line:84%
which is the human way,
in my view, a tribal way--

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:08.350 align:middle line:90%
it became monocultures.

00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:11.602 align:middle line:84%
And it became
communities of towns

00:54:11.602 --> 00:54:13.310 align:middle line:84%
that are just built
because of factories.

00:54:13.310 --> 00:54:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Driven by the
notion of prosperity.

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:16.030 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And in England, in Northern
England, where I come from,

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:23.170 align:middle line:84%
we have many fascinating and sad
and melancholic and wonderful

00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:25.900 align:middle line:84%
all mixed up together
examples of towns

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:28.880 align:middle line:84%
that were generated for
cotton factories and mills.

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: And steel production.

00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:33.524 align:middle line:84%
And when that
manufacturing disappears,

00:54:33.524 --> 00:54:35.190 align:middle line:84%
you end up with these
slums and ghettos.

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:36.564 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
ghost cities, yeah.

00:54:36.564 --> 00:54:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Ghost towns and
just inhuman ways of life.

00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And that decimated the
natural equilibrium

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:49.470 align:middle line:84%
of having youth and middle
age and wise elders.

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:50.790 align:middle line:90%
They went away.

00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So the wise elders no
longer had any reputation

00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:56.200 align:middle line:90%
or bearing or credibility.

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was no longer
considered necessary to be

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:01.950 align:middle line:90%
wise in your elderhood.

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:03.770 align:middle line:90%
And so people stopped bothering.

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:06.015 align:middle line:84%
All that mattered was
the youth and the middle

00:55:06.015 --> 00:55:09.780 align:middle line:90%
aged to accumulate wealth.

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:13.660 align:middle line:84%
The wealth wasn't considered
as knowledge and experience.

00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:17.730 align:middle line:84%
It was considered
purely and exclusively

00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:19.380 align:middle line:90%
as promissory notes.

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:20.950 align:middle line:90%
That was the wealth.

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And that came in,
really, after the time,

00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I would say, of Romanism and
Romanist Christianity, Nicene

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Christianity, in about 300 AD.

00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Before that, it was different.

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:34.152 align:middle line:90%
We had wise elders.

00:55:34.152 --> 00:55:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that had to
have been a critical turning

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:39.240 align:middle line:84%
point for the whole notion
of the emergence of empire

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:39.912 align:middle line:90%
in a way, too.

00:55:39.912 --> 00:55:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It was.

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:44.593 align:middle line:84%
Because they said to
change the control game,

00:55:44.593 --> 00:55:46.717 align:middle line:84%
rather than having this
immense pressure of control

00:55:46.717 --> 00:55:49.660 align:middle line:84%
and huge armies wandering
around the place,

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:52.240 align:middle line:84%
we have to just
restructure society

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:57.730 align:middle line:84%
into a way that devalues
elderhood and wisdom.

00:55:57.730 --> 00:56:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And now, if you even try
putting those words out there,

00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:05.030 align:middle line:84%
wise old people
are few in number

00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:07.490 align:middle line:84%
because it is no
longer a recognized

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:10.194 align:middle line:84%
part of a conscious,
thriving community.

00:56:10.194 --> 00:56:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And when I
do find it out there--

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:14.190 align:middle line:84%
which, thank goodness
it still is-- gosh.

00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:15.637 align:middle line:90%
It's so wonderful to see it.

00:56:15.637 --> 00:56:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Even in my little
coastal community in Oregon,

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.270 align:middle line:90%
we have some wise elders.

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And they're absolutely priceless
to the people who live there.

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.530 align:middle line:10%
And all kinds of
problems they're

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:27.720 align:middle line:10%
dealing with in this
kind of, like in the way

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:30.670 align:middle line:10%
a very wonderful vicar
in an English church

00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:33.330 align:middle line:10%
would have this pastoral
role to go and talk

00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:36.140 align:middle line:10%
to the young pregnant mother,
to go and talk to the dying man,

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:37.733 align:middle line:10%
to go and talk to
the young man who's

00:56:37.733 --> 00:56:39.110 align:middle line:10%
got in trouble with the police.

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:41.390 align:middle line:10%
And people would think,
oh, gosh, you know,

00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:45.440 align:middle line:10%
I can't mess around with this
guy because he's so wise.

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.450 align:middle line:90%
He's so insightful.

00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:48.292 align:middle line:84%
And I can't help
but respect him.

00:56:48.292 --> 00:56:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well
actually we did have

00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:51.555 align:middle line:84%
a reflection of that
in American media.

00:56:51.555 --> 00:56:53.180 align:middle line:84%
It was called "The
Andy Griffith Show."

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.132 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: [LAUGH] I
don't know that one.

00:56:55.132 --> 00:56:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he
was a policeman,

00:56:56.590 --> 00:56:58.542 align:middle line:84%
and he always offered
wise counsel to them--

00:56:58.542 --> 00:56:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Did he?

00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and worked the
problems out of the town.

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:01.083 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Did he?

00:57:01.083 --> 00:57:01.181 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:57:01.181 --> 00:57:01.960 align:middle line:90%
I'll have to check that out.

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I hear
what you're saying.

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:03.470 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:06.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's really
how it should be.

00:57:06.210 --> 00:57:07.272 align:middle line:90%
So any final thoughts?

00:57:07.272 --> 00:57:08.730 align:middle line:84%
We have just a
couple minutes left.

00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Anything we haven't gotten
to on the notion of empire

00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and how it continues to
exist throughout the times?

00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Empire is
weak, and empire can only

00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:20.530 align:middle line:90%
function with our consent.

00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Consider for yourself
withdrawing it.

00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that
note, thank you, Neil.

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:29.560 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have another
conversation about withdrawing

00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:33.220 align:middle line:84%
and about regaining
our sovereignty.

00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.560 align:middle line:10%
As we just said, part
two of our conversation

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:39.600 align:middle line:10%
is going to be about regaining
our sovereignty as individuals

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.580 align:middle line:10%
on this planet.

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on GaiamTV.

00:57:44.160 --> 00:58:02.600 align:middle line:90%
