00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.525 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:21.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I'm
sure that many of you,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.400 align:middle line:10%
like me, were alive
when the Soviet Missile

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.690 align:middle line:10%
Crisis played out.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.970 align:middle line:10%
We hid under our
desks, wrung our hands,

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.627 align:middle line:10%
and feared for our future.

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Little did we stop
to think that there

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.600 align:middle line:84%
were people on the other side
of the world feeling similarly.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:84%
This was the era of the
Cold War between the USA

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.010 align:middle line:90%
and the former Soviet Union.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.860 align:middle line:84%
We could be made to believe
anything through our media,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.098 align:middle line:90%
so could the Soviets.

00:00:42.098 --> 00:00:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to
look behind the walls

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
of global deceit
and disinformation

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.680 align:middle line:84%
through the eyes of a former
Soviet spy, Jack Barsky.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:90%
Jack, welcome.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Your book "Deep
Undercover," was, to me,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:84%
kind of a breakthrough
in getting behind

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.980 align:middle line:84%
and understanding what was
happening back in that day,

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.250 align:middle line:84%
but also the heart of
people who can choose

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.260 align:middle line:90%
to go into this industry.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Because this is high risk.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:90%
This is dangerous.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.680 align:middle line:84%
It has a lot of loneliness,
a lot of darkness around it.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:10%
And your book, I thought,
did such a beautiful job

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:10%
of detailing the growth of
a young boy into a young man

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.180 align:middle line:10%
into a brilliant student, a
brilliant member of the party

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:10%
that decided to
take this direction,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.037 align:middle line:10%
but the heart was very much
involved at the core of it.

00:01:29.037 --> 00:01:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JACK BARSKY: Absolutely.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: that was what
was so fascinating to me.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I'm glad
to be speaking with you

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.400 align:middle line:84%
at a time when there's
just so much disinformation

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:90%
and division happening globally.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, have you seen this--

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in your own
experience, obviously,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.830 align:middle line:84%
you're from East
Germany, and then

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.040 align:middle line:84%
trained in the Soviet Union,
and embedded illegally in the US

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.180 align:middle line:90%
as a spy, so you've seen a lot.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen a time like
this with such blatant deceit

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.180 align:middle line:90%
everywhere?

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: No.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.610 align:middle line:10%
Deceit was the order of the day
on the other side of the Iron

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.460 align:middle line:10%
Curtain because the media,
whatever it was, radio, TV,

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.740 align:middle line:10%
newspapers were controlled
by the party, by the state.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: were given
whatever the party

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:90%
wanted you to understand.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Something like
that is today still

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:84%
the case in China and in
some other dictatorial-type

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.580 align:middle line:90%
countries.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.540 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening in the
West is disheartening in

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:84%
that there used to be
an independent press.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.050 align:middle line:84%
There used to be people who
don't necessarily always take

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.080 align:middle line:84%
sides every time they write
something or say something.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And now, what's happening,
it's very difficult

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.197 align:middle line:84%
to distinguish between
the truth and a lie.

00:02:46.197 --> 00:02:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is what
I hear from everyone.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really, people
who have good hearts who

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.450 align:middle line:84%
want to do the right thing,
some of them are, in this case,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:84%
conservative, and
some of them are

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.248 align:middle line:84%
behind the liberals,
progressives, and Democrats,

00:02:59.248 --> 00:03:00.540 align:middle line:90%
all of them say the same thing.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:84%
I just don't even know
what to believe anymore.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And the
primary reason for that

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:84%
is that we are now divided into
at least two ideological camps.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And I know what
ideology can do to you.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Ideology is a set
of beliefs that

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:84%
excludes thinking to the
contrary of what's in that set.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.780 align:middle line:84%
So you see everything from
that ideological angle,

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:84%
and that's how I-- that
was one of the foundations

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.275 align:middle line:84%
for me signing up for
this high-risk profession.

00:03:34.275 --> 00:03:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, what
I'm going to do

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.400 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to have
a two-part conversation.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into, basically,
the making of a spy,

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.950 align:middle line:90%
in this one, and your life.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And then, I want to get into
what you just brought up,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.900 align:middle line:90%
these two ideological camps.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll get into the
implications of all that,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to meet with
your lovely daughter Chelsea

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and see the implications
of revelations,

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.560 align:middle line:84%
my dad was a spy, on
your kids and kind

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
of psychospiritual
implications there.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.280 align:middle line:90%
So that will be part two.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.810 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I want to get
into the area you were born in.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.240 align:middle line:90%
You were born in East Germany.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.225 align:middle line:84%
And during this time-- and
we'll get to that in your story.

00:04:16.225 --> 00:04:17.850 align:middle line:84%
There was a day you
were going touring,

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.300 align:middle line:90%
and there was a wall, OK?

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oops.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk
about the world

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.740 align:middle line:84%
you were born in in East
Germany post-World War II.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Yeah, it was four
years, almost exactly four

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.740 align:middle line:84%
years after the end
of World War II,

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and I was born in the Soviet
occupied area of Germany, which

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.310 align:middle line:90%
was devastated.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as the Soviet army
came in marching from the East,

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.080 align:middle line:84%
they destroyed everything
that was in their path.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And as Germany
then was defeated,

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:84%
whatever was left over--
when it was useful,

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.520 align:middle line:84%
was dismantled and shipped
back to the Soviet Union

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.530 align:middle line:84%
for reparations,
as opposed to what

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:84%
happened in the Western part,
where the Allies actually

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.378 align:middle line:90%
helped Germany rebuild.

00:05:07.378 --> 00:05:09.253 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Came in and
start to rebuild, yeah.

00:05:09.253 --> 00:05:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Rebuild.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.910 align:middle line:90%
We were wiped out.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And so this was a matter
of survival in those days.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.250 align:middle line:84%
It was about food, shelter,
clothing-- so the very basics.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't a lot of
room for all the other stuff,

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.743 align:middle line:84%
near the top of
Maslow's pyramid, where

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:27.660 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about--

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hierarchy
of needs, yeah.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Yeah, so emotional
needs and all that.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.030 align:middle line:84%
No, it was about
discipline and making sure

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:90%
that your life can continue.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I was brought up.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.073 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
talk about your family.

00:05:41.073 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about your
mom and dad a little bit

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and how the parties
started coming in,

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.640 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about
your relationship

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.265 align:middle line:84%
with your grandpa, which was
your actual heart connection.

00:05:50.265 --> 00:05:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Right, both of
my parents were teachers.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.090 align:middle line:90%
The East German rulers jointly--

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.990 align:middle line:84%
they made a decision jointly
with the Russian occupational

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:84%
forces to throw out everybody
in the education sector

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.540 align:middle line:84%
who had any ties
to the Nazi party.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So they trained a phenomenal
number of people, young people,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.930 align:middle line:90%
to become teachers.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how they met,
and they were both teaching

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.220 align:middle line:90%
in a small village.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was born at the time
when they were both teaching.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And being the
child of a teacher,

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.180 align:middle line:84%
it adds additional performance
anxiety, too, right?

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And he was an interesting
dichotomy between my two

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.390 align:middle line:90%
set of grandparents.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.640 align:middle line:84%
My mother's parents never
once played with me.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.220 align:middle line:90%


00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.450 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather, my mother's
father was a forest ranger.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.420 align:middle line:84%
You would think that you
would take the little boy

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.850 align:middle line:90%
out in the woods and so on.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.060 align:middle line:90%
Nothing ever.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.190 align:middle line:84%
When we visited
my other brother,

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.130 align:middle line:84%
we were just sitting in a
corner, and we had to be quiet.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:08.210 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, my father's
parents were much more warm.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And the only love I
felt within that family,

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.400 align:middle line:84%
that includes father and mother,
came from my grandfather,

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Opa.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Opa, yeah.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
family dynamics and the party.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And then, I want to get
to a place in your life

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:29.400 align:middle line:84%
where you teasingly told
your mama, I'm too big.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.583 align:middle line:84%
I don't need you to kiss
me good night anymore.

00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And what started turning
in you at that point?

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:84%
It still makes me
cry a little bit.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.600 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the party first,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.300 align:middle line:90%
how they ended up being--

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.045 align:middle line:90%
groomed your dad into the party.

00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Well, so my father
wanted to have a career.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And in those days-- now we're
talking about the early '50s

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.095 align:middle line:84%
into the mid '50s, you
had to be a party member

00:07:56.095 --> 00:07:57.345 align:middle line:90%
if you wanted to go someplace.

00:07:57.345 --> 00:07:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To excel at anything?

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.105 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: To be allowed to
excel at something, right?

00:08:01.105 --> 00:08:01.905 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:01.905 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And so this
is how he eventually

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:12.420 align:middle line:84%
got his principal position in
another town to which we moved.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, he made it
even further in his career,

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.860 align:middle line:84%
but that's when I had a
normal relationship with him.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And my mother sang at the
time in a church choir.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.900 align:middle line:90%
She had to quit that.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your dad was
very anti-Christianity,

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.020 align:middle line:90%
religion of any kind.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Yeah, well, I
don't think he grew up

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.659 align:middle line:90%
with any kind of religion.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Remember, this
was during the war, right?

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:42.179 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And I
once found a Bible

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:45.270 align:middle line:84%
in my grandparents' house,
and I started reading it.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't get
very far because you

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.870 align:middle line:84%
don't read that book from
the beginning as a child.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:58.500 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, the party was
influential in every part

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.720 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Even in kindergarten, we
were being indoctrinated

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.352 align:middle line:90%
in a very soft, nice way.

00:09:08.352 --> 00:09:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was
reading that, and I

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.150 align:middle line:84%
thought, what a nice
inducement into kindergarten,

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:84%
with your little packet that
had the little sweets in it,

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.880 align:middle line:84%
and the colored pencils
or crayons and so forth,

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.110 align:middle line:84%
to make it a really special
day to enter into the system.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: In kindergarten
and elementary school,

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:84%
the focus was on
humanity and the fact

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.660 align:middle line:84%
that we were growing
up in a humane society.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.450 align:middle line:84%
For instance, one of the good
things about this ideology

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:90%
was that there was no racism.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No racism.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.625 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: There was no racism.

00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:38.542 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:09:38.542 --> 00:09:40.592 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Every
picture of young kids,

00:09:40.592 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
where they had more than one
kid-- there was one brown, one

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.660 align:middle line:90%
white, and one yellow.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.327 align:middle line:84%
Now it's easy to be
not racist if you

00:09:48.327 --> 00:09:50.160 align:middle line:84%
don't have other racists
living next to you.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right?

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.655 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it's an ideology.

00:09:52.655 --> 00:09:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.390 align:middle line:84%
But the party, I mean,
it was everywhere--

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.300 align:middle line:84%
school, and kindergarten,
and on, and on, and on.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, I think
it was at least 10%

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.373 align:middle line:84%
of the adult population
were party members.

00:10:08.373 --> 00:10:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And those are
the ones that advance?

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.140 align:middle line:90%
Those are the ones that had--

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Absolutely.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --little better food.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:84%
They had maybe even a car,
which your family did end up

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:15.780 align:middle line:90%
with a car, right?

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Yes, but
that was because

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.160 align:middle line:90%
of my father's initiative.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:90%
He bought it used.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Now if there were--

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:27.190 align:middle line:84%
for instance, the government
owned all real estate,

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:31.690 align:middle line:84%
so if you wanted to
have a nicer flat,

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:32.990 align:middle line:90%
you had to be in good standing.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: There was total
control, pretty much,

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:41.350 align:middle line:84%
with some minor exceptions
because they allowed

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.110 align:middle line:84%
some entrepreneurship
up until the point

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.580 align:middle line:84%
when the entrepreneurs
got too big,

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.140 align:middle line:90%
then they were expropriated.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And they allowed a little
bit of church life,

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.802 align:middle line:84%
but the church was
infested with Stasi agents.

00:10:54.802 --> 00:10:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
right, I mean, this

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.910 align:middle line:84%
is one of the things
I found interesting

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.993 align:middle line:84%
because your dad would
always call it fairy tales.

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
Saturday mornings,

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.450 align:middle line:84%
you had a class that was
teaching you about religion?

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.960 align:middle line:90%
And he made you quit?

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Interestingly enough,
there was a voluntary class.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.210 align:middle line:84%
At the end, we
actually went to school

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.110 align:middle line:90%
on Saturdays for a half day.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
that half day, there

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.422 align:middle line:84%
was a voluntary class
to teach religion.

00:11:19.422 --> 00:11:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I thought
that was interesting.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And I was not
allowed to participate.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's this scene
in the book where

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.450 align:middle line:84%
the friend of mine, whose
father was a policeman,

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:31.117 align:middle line:84%
he was not allowed, either,
and we were listening.

00:11:31.117 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:90%
What are they teaching in there?

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.390 align:middle line:90%
What are they teaching in there?

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.995 align:middle line:84%
We were curious, but dad just
said, don't worry about it.

00:11:36.995 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:90%
This is all nonsense.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's all fairy tales.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.885 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Absolutely, yeah.

00:11:39.885 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about that moment at home

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.888 align:middle line:84%
that I mentioned a
little earlier, where

00:11:45.888 --> 00:11:47.680 align:middle line:84%
as-- what were you,
six or seven years old?

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:90%
you were quite young.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And you said to your
mom, I don't need you

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.825 align:middle line:90%
to kiss me goodnight anymore.

00:11:51.825 --> 00:11:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: This is
secondary memory.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.670 align:middle line:84%
The reason I know this
because she would tell people

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.430 align:middle line:84%
over and over again, and
sometimes in my presence,

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:middle line:90%
how mature I was at a young age.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.140 align:middle line:90%
She was proud of me.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And so it was the case
that, at one point,

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.960 align:middle line:90%
she tried to kiss me good night.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey,
mom, I'm old enough.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't need a
good-night kiss anymore.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.400 align:middle line:90%
And I tried to be funny.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.112 align:middle line:90%
I have this little--

00:12:21.112 --> 00:12:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Impish part of you.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes, I do.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And I see this in
my last daughter.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:27.650 align:middle line:90%
She's just the same way.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.530 align:middle line:84%
She would say things
she doesn't mean, just

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.460 align:middle line:90%
to be funny and entertaining.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to be funny,
and that backfired,

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.530 align:middle line:90%
because she took it seriously.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And she said, OK, and she turned
around, turned the lights off.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.380 align:middle line:90%
And here I was all by myself.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.338 align:middle line:90%
All I wanted was a hug.

00:12:42.338 --> 00:12:43.138 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right?

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.283 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were just teasing.

00:12:45.283 --> 00:12:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Absolutely.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But that ended.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: If that happened
to me today with my children,

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.490 align:middle line:84%
I would say, you little
stinker, I'm just

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:55.720 align:middle line:90%
going to hug you even harder.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: That's exactly
what they want anyway.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And because there was kind of
an absent of this warm and fuzzy

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:84%
affection anyway, when
that last ritual left,

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.990 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't a lot left on an
emotionally supportive level.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:09.686 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Correct.

00:13:09.686 --> 00:13:11.990 align:middle line:84%
As far back as my
memory reaches,

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.050 align:middle line:84%
I cannot remember
a hug or a kiss--

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: --any
physical interaction

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.070 align:middle line:90%
between my parents and me.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's devastating
to a very sensitive little boy

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.450 align:middle line:90%
because one of the things you--

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.658 align:middle line:84%
and I talked on the phone
a couple of weeks ago prior

00:13:27.658 --> 00:13:30.405 align:middle line:84%
to this, and you said, this is
really kind of a love story.

00:13:30.405 --> 00:13:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I had
grokked out of it, too.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.155 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
to that part in a bit,

00:13:34.155 --> 00:13:35.705 align:middle line:84%
about being a
brokenhearted lover

00:13:35.705 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:84%
or a broken-hearted dreamer
and what that can propel you

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:90%
toward, obviously.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: There's a very
insightful friend of mine who,

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.540 align:middle line:90%
not too long ago, called me.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.510 align:middle line:90%
I forgot the context.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.475 align:middle line:90%
He said, Jack, you are a lover.

00:13:49.475 --> 00:13:50.275 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:50.275 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And I was
that when I was a child.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.660 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't figure out how
to love and how to be loved,

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and that messed a
lot of things up.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But you were at heart.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:90%
That was your essence.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:84%
That's what you were
always looking for.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: And I still am.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.042 align:middle line:84%
And that came through
to me loud and clear,

00:14:04.042 --> 00:14:08.800 align:middle line:84%
which is why I was so intrigued
with the spiritual aspect

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and psychology of
how your life went.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:14.017 align:middle line:84%
So now you get to a point--
you're doing great at school.

00:14:14.017 --> 00:14:15.100 align:middle line:90%
You're a smart little guy.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:15.670 align:middle line:90%
You have to.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:16.990 align:middle line:90%
You got teachers for parents.

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.550 align:middle line:90%
You guys are progressing along.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.240 align:middle line:84%
You have a car, and you
go to Berlin on a trip.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Now we came
back from the Baltic Sea.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.090 align:middle line:90%
We were on a family vacation.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And we were going to
stop over in Berlin

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:30.700 align:middle line:90%
and go over to the West.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.290 align:middle line:84%
In those days, it
was open, right?

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.293 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And buy
some things that you

00:14:34.293 --> 00:14:35.800 align:middle line:90%
couldn't get in the east.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.140 align:middle line:90%
So as we get closer to Berlin--

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how close
we got, maybe 20 miles.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.720 align:middle line:84%
The roads were closed,
and we were turned away

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.000 align:middle line:90%
and weren't really told why.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And that was August 13, 1961
when the wall was erected,

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.340 align:middle line:90%
and I ran right into it.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:15:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and I
mean, how did your father

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.532 align:middle line:90%
respond to this?

00:15:02.532 --> 00:15:04.990 align:middle line:84%
How did that feel to suddenly
feel like-- now, you guys are

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.125 align:middle line:90%
in a cage, basically?

00:15:07.125 --> 00:15:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Yeah, but we
bought the propaganda hook,

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.920 align:middle line:90%
line, and sinker, so did he.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Remember, at this
time, he was already

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:18.000 align:middle line:84%
a principal of a middle school,
so he would lead the charge

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.510 align:middle line:84%
in explaining that we built
the wall to protect us

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.180 align:middle line:84%
from the evil
capitalists that were

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.783 align:middle line:84%
trying to undermine us and,
just, pretty much take over.

00:15:27.783 --> 00:15:30.325 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the other side
was full of Nazis and Americans,

00:15:30.325 --> 00:15:31.125 align:middle line:90%
basically?

00:15:31.125 --> 00:15:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Absolutely.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.572 align:middle line:84%
Well, but there
were some ex-Nazis

00:15:34.572 --> 00:15:35.655 align:middle line:90%
in West German government.

00:15:35.655 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, sure they were.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:37.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.410 align:middle line:84%
But the fear went even
beyond that, right?

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Sure.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.305 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, go ahead.

00:15:41.305 --> 00:15:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And the fact of the
matter was that, actually,

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:84%
the wall was built
primarily to prevent

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:49.090 align:middle line:90%
more people from leaving.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From leaving because
they had it better over there.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: We didn't know that.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Leaving was never, ever
discussed in our household.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.950 align:middle line:90%
My parents were doing well.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Teachers were paid well.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.240 align:middle line:84%
When my father
became a principal,

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.110 align:middle line:90%
we lived in a nice house.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.060 align:middle line:90%
And he had a car.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, he was the first one
in the village who had a car.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.730 align:middle line:90%
We had a good life.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:12.990 align:middle line:90%
There was no reason to leave.

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:16.470 align:middle line:84%
We also didn't have any close
relatives in the Western part.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:22.320 align:middle line:84%
So from a selfish point of view,
my dad and, to some extent,

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:84%
my mother embracing the
socialist propaganda--

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Life was good enough.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:29.285 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah, sure.

00:16:29.285 --> 00:16:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK, so
that's just like a practical,

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.480 align:middle line:90%
this was good.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Finally, we're protected
from the evil ones

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.220 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.887 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And you
could rationalize this

00:16:37.887 --> 00:16:41.280 align:middle line:84%
really well because we-- you
know, the propaganda had done

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:46.500 align:middle line:84%
its job for us to believe
that the future of the world

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.850 align:middle line:84%
would be a communist world,
where everybody gets along,

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.820 align:middle line:84%
there's no people who are
suffering because they're not

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.970 align:middle line:84%
suppressed by rich people
who take money from them

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.090 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.960 align:middle line:84%
So that sounds not
very bad, doesn't it?

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.210 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it sounds really good.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone's guaranteed
food, clothing, shelter,

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:90%
and a job.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.359 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: It's a romantic
notion that is very hard not

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:13.672 align:middle line:90%
to embrace as a young person.

00:17:13.672 --> 00:17:15.089 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
could understand

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:17.160 align:middle line:84%
that, especially that's
your only exposure as well.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.618 align:middle line:84%
You didn't really know what
was happening on the other side

00:17:19.618 --> 00:17:21.420 align:middle line:90%
till about 15 years or so later.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.109 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: That is
absolutely right.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:24.067 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So meanwhile,
you excelled at school.

00:17:24.067 --> 00:17:26.250 align:middle line:84%
You went to a really
nice school for--

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.043 align:middle line:84%
was it coed, the school
that you went to--

00:17:28.043 --> 00:17:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes, it was.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.472 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
the second level.

00:17:30.472 --> 00:17:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Your system's a little
different than the West.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I just
wrote down, because this

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:84%
was a classic
education, studying

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.600 align:middle line:84%
German, Russian, English,
history, art, music,

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:84%
philosophy, biology, geography,
you were well educated.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.155 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, it puts
American education to shame.

00:17:46.155 --> 00:17:47.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Absolutely true.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was acknowledged
when Germany United

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.650 align:middle line:84%
that the Eastern
German education system

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.090 align:middle line:90%
was superior to the Western.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.360 align:middle line:90%
We were being drilled hammered.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.865 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:01.865 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And it
was hardcore stuff.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Compared to, let's say,
the American system,

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:84%
we were probably
two years ahead.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.320 align:middle line:84%
What is being taught in
the first years of college

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.350 align:middle line:84%
in this country was still
taken care of in high school.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And as far as philosophy,
you only studied--

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.810 align:middle line:84%
in politics, you
only studied Marx.

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.905 align:middle line:84%
None of the great German
philosophers, right?

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:27.705 align:middle line:90%
It was all Marx.

00:18:27.705 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: In high
school, that is correct.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And there was one moment when
we had one class that was--

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.200 align:middle line:84%
I can't translate this,
but it was fundamentally

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.040 align:middle line:90%
a communist ideology--

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:90%
Marxism, Leninism, and so forth.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And there was one session
when the teacher brought up

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.400 align:middle line:84%
the theme of, what is
the meaning of life?

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And his explanation left
me completely empty.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember
that in the book.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: It was
nothing but propaganda.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Like, the meaning of life
is to make life better

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.350 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of the world, and
workers of the world unite.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.630 align:middle line:90%
It was all platitudes.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.870 align:middle line:90%
But that didn't answer--

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.037 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was no
depth, no feeling, no spirit.

00:19:13.037 --> 00:19:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: That didn't
answer the questions of,

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.100 align:middle line:90%
where did I come from?

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.520 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.620 align:middle line:90%
What am I supposed to do?

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.495 align:middle line:90%
And where am I going?

00:19:20.495 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:90%
None of that.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't, he
couldn't answer that.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.787 align:middle line:84%
He should have stayed
away from that topic.

00:19:27.787 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:84%
The communist ideology does
not have an answer for that.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Which leaves a soul deficit,
a spiritual deficit in people

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.290 align:middle line:84%
because your being is searching
for something much deeper,

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and the system isn't
giving it to you.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Correct.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
nowhere to get it.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:45.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, another part from there
that I found interesting

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:49.650 align:middle line:84%
was November 22, 1963,
when you were in school

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.560 align:middle line:90%
and when Kennedy was shot.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
surprised because I

00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.960 align:middle line:84%
would have thought it would be a
time of jubilee in East Germany

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.220 align:middle line:90%
and Russia.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And how you described that
day wasn't what I expected.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: We, in the East, and
not necessarily at the party

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:84%
at the highest level,
but us underlings

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.700 align:middle line:84%
romanticized certain
figures in the West.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:21.510 align:middle line:84%
JFK was one of them, and
Willy Brandt, the West German

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.180 align:middle line:90%
chancellor, was the other.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: As a matter of
fact, when he won an election,

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:29.940 align:middle line:84%
it was really close, and I
was in college at that time,

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:90%
we were all celebrating.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
that came from.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, what was
it about Kennedy and Brandt

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.580 align:middle line:90%
that you kind of romanticized?

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:42.900 align:middle line:90%
What did they represent to you?

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Well, they were
young, energetic, and didn't

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:51.540 align:middle line:84%
seem to be as hostile towards us
as the rest of the West, right?

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Because as you mentioned
before, we were just as afraid

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.723 align:middle line:84%
of a war breaking out as the
people in the United States

00:21:00.723 --> 00:21:01.640 align:middle line:90%
and West Germany were.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sure, we had
military all around you.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's, I think, what people
didn't understand because we

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:90%
can only see our child-like--

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:84%
through our own fearful
lens of the evil Soviets.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.973 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there was no nuance there.

00:21:16.973 --> 00:21:19.307 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Now there's one
other thing I need to mention.

00:21:19.307 --> 00:21:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes?

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Kennedy
was obviously one

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:24.630 align:middle line:84%
of the most charismatic
leaders of that century,

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:middle line:90%
and so was Willy Brandt.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Our leaders were-- we
thought they were dumb.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, we bought into
the whole concept of where

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:36.030 align:middle line:84%
we were going,
but we always were

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:39.660 align:middle line:84%
hoping for some smarter
people to get to the top.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.790 align:middle line:84%
We had two leaders
during my time there.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.160 align:middle line:90%
One was Walter Ulbricht.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:49.410 align:middle line:84%
The guy spoke with a
very pronounced Saxonian

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.670 align:middle line:90%
accent, which was--

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.300 align:middle line:90%
this was despised amongst the--

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.885 align:middle line:90%
this was like, ugh.

00:21:55.885 --> 00:21:56.685 align:middle line:90%
It was terrible.

00:21:56.685 --> 00:21:59.075 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where does that
accent exist in Germany today

00:21:59.075 --> 00:21:59.875 align:middle line:90%
or does it?

00:21:59.875 --> 00:22:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Leipzig, Dresden.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Leipzig, OK,
Dresden, all right.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And Erich Honecker
he slurred his speech a lot,

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.430 align:middle line:90%
not because he drank.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:10.230 align:middle line:90%
They were both--

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
weren't charismatic,

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.230 align:middle line:84%
they didn't sound
intelligent, and they

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.745 align:middle line:84%
were spewing out ideology
that didn't have a soul.

00:22:15.745 --> 00:22:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Platitudes.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Platitudes.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: As if
they were reading

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:25.350 align:middle line:84%
from the cover page of
the party newspaper,

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.630 align:middle line:90%
which nobody ever read.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.592 align:middle line:84%
We always went right
to the sports page.

00:22:29.592 --> 00:22:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] Right.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.425 align:middle line:84%
So these people were just
lustrous next to them.

00:22:36.425 --> 00:22:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because theoretically,
the people were German.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Brandt was just on the
other side of my wall, right?

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.025 align:middle line:84%
And so you should have had
some of that heart left,

00:22:47.025 --> 00:22:48.900 align:middle line:84%
but it sounds like it
was kind of drilled out

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.900 align:middle line:84%
of you through the process
of indoctrination, education,

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:53.700 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right.

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, we still know
deep down inside

00:22:55.830 --> 00:23:00.660 align:middle line:84%
that we were on
moral high ground,

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:07.790 align:middle line:84%
even though our leaders were
not the most likable people,

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:08.725 align:middle line:90%
none of them.

00:23:08.725 --> 00:23:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so there
are several things

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:12.580 align:middle line:90%
that happened here.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.773 align:middle line:84%
One of them is you
came in at one time--

00:23:14.773 --> 00:23:16.440 align:middle line:84%
and I'm kind of hopping
ahead of myself,

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.090 align:middle line:90%
but you visited Buchenwald.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:20.225 align:middle line:84%
This became part of your
philosophical shaping.

00:23:20.225 --> 00:23:21.025 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:23:21.025 --> 00:23:23.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And also, there
was a moment when you came

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.400 align:middle line:10%
in to a science class, and
the teacher was saying, wait,

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.760 align:middle line:10%
listen to that--

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.810 align:middle line:10%
beep, beep, with
the Sputnik, right?

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.297 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Now these two
things were a few years apart.

00:23:34.297 --> 00:23:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they
were a few years apart,

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:40.720 align:middle line:84%
but I'm just taking a couple
psychologically influential

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.520 align:middle line:90%
events.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.603 align:middle line:90%
Because with the Sputnik--

00:23:42.603 --> 00:23:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: The Sputnik pretty
much proved to us that

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.530 align:middle line:84%
the Soviet Union was
forging ahead and was--

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The most
powerful, progressive nation

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:50.510 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And then
you had the first man

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.940 align:middle line:84%
in space, who was Yuri
Gagarin, a Russian, right?

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And so
then the Americans--

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:59.732 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You knew you
were on the side of right.

00:23:59.732 --> 00:24:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Absolutely, not only
emotionally ideologically,

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.010 align:middle line:90%
but now also--

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.695 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Technologically.

00:24:04.695 --> 00:24:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: --in term terms
of-- technologically,

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.960 align:middle line:90%
scientifically.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.195 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yeah.

00:24:08.195 --> 00:24:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And so then, let's talk a
little bit about Buchenwald,

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and we're just looking at the
shaping of your patriotism.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:21.432 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Yeah,
well, I have no proof

00:24:21.432 --> 00:24:22.890 align:middle line:84%
of what I'm going
to say now, but I

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:26.910 align:middle line:84%
believe this was orchestrated
by the party, these visits,

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:31.470 align:middle line:84%
because there was a requirement
for all high school students'

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:36.030 align:middle line:84%
classes in their junior year
to visit a concentration camp.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And the number-one concentration
camp most people would go to

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.160 align:middle line:90%
was Buchenwald.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And the exhibits,
they were like--

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:51.720 align:middle line:84%
it was the most horrific things
I've ever seen in my life.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:57.450 align:middle line:10%
That includes not just pictures
of like piles of corpses,

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:01.260 align:middle line:10%
but real things
like lampshades that

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.780 align:middle line:10%
were made out of human skin.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And they were made on behalf of
the wife of the commandant, who

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.880 align:middle line:84%
would pick out incoming
prisoners because they

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:90%
had nice tattoos on them.

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And they were
killed and skinned.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:20.660 align:middle line:84%
To just even think of that a
human being can do something

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:21.935 align:middle line:90%
like that-- a woman--

00:25:21.935 --> 00:25:23.643 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I couldn't
even look at it.

00:25:23.643 --> 00:25:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And the
worst thing that you

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.480 align:middle line:84%
could see there was shrunken
heads, a couple of them,

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.570 align:middle line:90%
the size of my fist.

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Real heads of real
people that, at one point,

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.850 align:middle line:90%
sat on somebody's shoulder.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And then came the
decisive moment

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:50.360 align:middle line:84%
where we knew that we were
on the right side of history.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
juxtaposition of the fact

00:25:54.980 --> 00:26:00.320 align:middle line:84%
that the leader of the
Communist Party, Ernst Thalmann,

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.350 align:middle line:84%
was moved to Buchenwald just
before the end of the war

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.550 align:middle line:90%
and executed there.

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:09.305 align:middle line:90%


00:26:09.305 --> 00:26:13.770 align:middle line:84%
The, at that point, leader of
the Bundesnachrichtendienst

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:16.310 align:middle line:84%
which is the
equivalent of the CIA,

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:20.090 align:middle line:84%
was military intelligence
under Hitler.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Think about the two of them.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.070 align:middle line:84%
There was conclusive
evidence that we

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:30.170 align:middle line:84%
were the anti-fascist
section of Germany,

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and the Nazis were still
influential in the West.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But no
one was looking--

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.283 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: -- end of story.

00:26:34.283 --> 00:26:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --at the numbers
that Stalin racked up?

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Oh, no.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:42.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, Stalin, that's a
whole different story.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are brutal,
brutal people on both sides,

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:50.652 align:middle line:84%
but was that story not shared
with you or the numbers

00:26:50.652 --> 00:26:51.860 align:middle line:90%
of people that were murdered?

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Khrushchev, in his
1956 speech, sort of dealt

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.010 align:middle line:90%
with the cult of personality.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:01.640 align:middle line:84%
But do you think
there were details

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.340 align:middle line:84%
came out about what
really happened

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and how many people were
victimized by Stalin?

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:90%
This was glossed over.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:13.740 align:middle line:84%
This was like, oh, yeah,
well, Stalin was a bad guy.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.650 align:middle line:84%
He was a good guy,
but he was a bad guy,

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and this cult of
personality wasn't--

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:20.990 align:middle line:84%
we shouldn't have that, like
the same thing happened with Mao

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But actually, the details of how
he starved a couple of million

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Ukrainians--

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my gosh.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:28.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, so many people died.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:33.800 align:middle line:10%
>>BARSKY: Peasants, who they
stole the grain from and how he

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.870 align:middle line:10%
shot--

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:38.148 align:middle line:10%
he wound up killing
so many people.

00:27:38.148 --> 00:27:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, the
numbers knocked around now,

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:43.890 align:middle line:84%
we're up to 66 million
people died under him.

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, it's
being bandied about.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: It depends
who does the counting.

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lot of people.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.500 align:middle line:90%
Tens of millions.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: The bottom
line, it was glossed over.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:54.650 align:middle line:84%
It depends upon what
you shine a light on.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And the light was
shined on the fact

00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:00.170 align:middle line:84%
that there was some influential
people in West Germany who

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:05.120 align:middle line:84%
had served under Hitler,
and we were the heirs.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.580 align:middle line:84%
We were the self-appointed
heirs of [INAUDIBLE],,

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.920 align:middle line:90%
who fought the Nazis.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.040 align:middle line:90%
The communists in the '30s was--

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.690 align:middle line:84%
the Communist Party
was the only force

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:18.720 align:middle line:84%
that actually went head
to head, mano y mano,

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.970 align:middle line:90%
in the streets with the Nazis.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Now if they had
won, would the outcome

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.710 align:middle line:90%
have been better?

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:25.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:27.665 align:middle line:84%
It would have been dictatorial
in a different way.

00:28:27.665 --> 00:28:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:31.880 align:middle line:84%
One thing I find interesting,
this whole notion

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:36.380 align:middle line:90%
of propaganda.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:37.970 align:middle line:90%
I have a German brother-in-law.

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, first, I went to
the Deutsches Museum.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed there
wasn't anything

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:46.660 align:middle line:90%
there between the years of--

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:47.918 align:middle line:90%
during the World War II.

00:28:47.918 --> 00:28:50.460 align:middle line:84%
All the years of World War II,
the technology and everything,

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.070 align:middle line:84%
it was just kind
of a gap, a kind

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.333 align:middle line:90%
of missing part of history.

00:28:53.333 --> 00:28:54.250 align:middle line:90%
I thought, that's odd.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:58.220 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of technological
development at that time.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Then, my brother-in-law, who's
German, from 'Nuremberg, right?

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.300 align:middle line:84%
He came over, and
the show "Holocaust"

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.420 align:middle line:90%
played in America in the 1970s.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.760 align:middle line:90%
And he was appalled.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.190 align:middle line:84%
He was just devastated
to watch it.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:14.750 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know any of that.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:17.645 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't taught in school.

00:29:17.645 --> 00:29:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, you look at
how each of our countries,

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:25.940 align:middle line:84%
in their own way, erase really
significant historical facts so

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:30.110 align:middle line:84%
that we can somehow continue
to live with ourselves

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:33.560 align:middle line:84%
or continue to build whatever
it is that those at the top

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.150 align:middle line:90%
desire us to build.

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I was absolutely shocked to know
that he knew nothing about it.

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Mm-hmm.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's--

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:43.013 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How can your
erase all of this?

00:29:43.013 --> 00:29:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: I think you
draw the right parallel.

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:49.790 align:middle line:84%
This is protecting yourself
from of self-destruction

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.630 align:middle line:84%
by remembering the bad things
you have done in the past.

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:53.430 align:middle line:90%
This is--

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:54.888 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or that
your parents did.

00:29:54.888 --> 00:29:56.430 align:middle line:84%
You weren't even
part of, you know?

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Your grandparents even.

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.135 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Right, and in
the US, it's slavery.

00:29:59.135 --> 00:30:01.846 align:middle line:84%
And in Germany,
it's the Holocaust.

00:30:01.846 --> 00:30:04.123 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:04.123 --> 00:30:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: There's
a shame, there's

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:10.100 align:middle line:84%
a discomfort that
makes a lot of people

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.230 align:middle line:90%
just not want to remember.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, for instance, my
grandfather, the forest ranger,

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:22.410 align:middle line:84%
he must have had some
connection to the Nazi party.

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:24.600 align:middle line:84%
My other grandfather,
he served in the Army,

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.370 align:middle line:90%
but he didn't do much.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:29.640 align:middle line:84%
He was hanging out
in Sweden, way north,

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.080 align:middle line:90%
where it was cold all the time.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:35.640 align:middle line:84%
But neither ever, ever
talked about the time

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.280 align:middle line:90%
prior to World War II.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.530 align:middle line:84%
There was never any talk
about history in our family.

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:42.330 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's what
I learned through his family

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:44.810 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:45.810 align:middle line:90%
It's just crazy.

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.692 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: We want to deny.

00:30:47.692 --> 00:30:48.900 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to be reminded.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.510 align:middle line:90%


00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:57.180 align:middle line:84%
There's people who have bad
things in their past such as I,

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.900 align:middle line:84%
but I have confronted
all of them.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.550 align:middle line:90%


00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:02.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a big relief.

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:05.610 align:middle line:84%
If you keep on bottling
it up, you will eventually

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:08.910 align:middle line:90%
die fundamentally unfulfilled.

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we're going to
speed this story up.

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're kind of
getting who you

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:19.170 align:middle line:84%
were, how you were educated, the
environment you were raised in.

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:20.610 align:middle line:90%
Now, you're a bright young man.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.220 align:middle line:84%
You're the brightest
of the bright.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.945 align:middle line:84%
You go on to, is
it called, Jena?

00:31:24.945 --> 00:31:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Jena, yeah.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Jena, Jena
University, which

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:33.660 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful building that
was confiscated from people way

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.190 align:middle line:90%
back when after the war.

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:36.780 align:middle line:90%
And you fell in love with--

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.270 align:middle line:84%
you're excelling at everything,
fabulous at chemistry,

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:41.940 align:middle line:84%
become rising in the
party, youth party.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.610 align:middle line:84%
You're also rising in
your position academically

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.040 align:middle line:84%
to the top of your
chemistry department.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And you have fallen in love
with a girl named Rosie.

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Now she
was in high school.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's go back.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:56.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you fell in love with
Rosie in high school, right.

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And your heart is just,
like, all in, right?

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: All in.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.740 align:middle line:90%
I was 16.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.860 align:middle line:84%
I started developing
crushes on girls

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.220 align:middle line:90%
in seventh and eighth grade.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And they
were from a distance.

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:11.250 align:middle line:84%
But I knew, I loved
this one, and I really--

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:13.320 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how to
even get close to them.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were
these mysterious beings.

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Angelic, wonderful,
to be admired from a distance,

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:24.510 align:middle line:90%
and I was just too shy to even--

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:26.370 align:middle line:90%
just, like, be near them.

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:31.065 align:middle line:84%
And then, I went to high
school, and this was a coed--

00:32:31.065 --> 00:32:35.460 align:middle line:84%
we were in a dorm where
the girls and boys were

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.680 align:middle line:90%
in the same big, old villa.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And initially, I targeted
one of the girls,

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and she just was
teasing me all the time.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.350 align:middle line:90%
And then, Rosie came in.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And she sort of
introduced herself.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first time that
a girl paid attention to me,

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:53.280 align:middle line:90%
and it felt good.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of 10th grade,
we were holding hands already.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, we came back from
vacation, and she told me,

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:05.460 align:middle line:84%
I've reconnected
with my boyfriend.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Her boyfriend was a
college student already.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:12.570 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm chasing after
this girl for an entire year.

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:13.690 align:middle line:90%
I made myself useful.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:14.490 align:middle line:90%
I hung around.

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:15.662 align:middle line:90%
I carried her bags.

00:33:15.662 --> 00:33:16.620 align:middle line:90%
I helped her with math.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:20.130 align:middle line:90%


00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Through deeds, I figured
I could get her back,

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:23.430 align:middle line:90%
and I actually did.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:27.000 align:middle line:84%
When we came back from
vacation into our senior year,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.580 align:middle line:84%
she told me, I broke
up with this other guy.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And so we were an item
for an entire year.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:39.660 align:middle line:90%
It was bliss.

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:40.800 align:middle line:90%
It was so wonderful.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Literally, I
dedicated my future--

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:46.860 align:middle line:84%
and it was at a point where I
really kicked in academically.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I started getting all A's
because I started actually--

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.270 align:middle line:90%
I started working at it.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I was going
to have a great career,

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:57.160 align:middle line:84%
and it was all and
dedication to her.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To Rosie.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.935 align:middle line:90%


00:34:01.935 --> 00:34:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And the entire school knew that
we were going to get married.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:05.880 align:middle line:90%
We were already an item.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.010 align:middle line:90%
We were together all the time.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And I had my first sexual
encounter at the age 18.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.699 align:middle line:84%
So everything was wonderful,
and I just couldn't wait to--

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:19.699 align:middle line:84%
she went to study in
Berlin and I in Jena.

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:23.429 align:middle line:84%
And those two cities were, in
those days, very far apart.

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:25.920 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have any cars,
and public transportation

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:26.820 align:middle line:90%
took forever.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.295 align:middle line:84%
So the only communication
was through mail,

00:34:29.295 --> 00:34:31.960 align:middle line:84%
and she broke up
with me via letter.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.989 align:middle line:90%
God, my world fell apart.

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:36.120 align:middle line:84%
You understand, when you
focus on this one thing,

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:41.344 align:middle line:84%
this one person and that person
goes away, now you really

00:34:41.344 --> 00:34:43.469 align:middle line:84%
don't know what's the
meaning of your life anymore.

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:44.886 align:middle line:84%
I thought I had
found the meaning,

00:34:44.886 --> 00:34:49.500 align:middle line:84%
serving Rosie, and
that disappeared,

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:55.230 align:middle line:84%
which made a big dent
in my emotional self.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:57.570 align:middle line:90%
It hardened me.

00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And I dated some girls, but
it took two years for me

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.105 align:middle line:84%
to even date another
girl in college.

00:35:03.105 --> 00:35:06.665 align:middle line:84%
And I always kept
them at arm's length.

00:35:06.665 --> 00:35:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you became
kind of one of the guys.

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:09.957 align:middle line:90%
You were playing basketball.

00:35:09.957 --> 00:35:12.476 align:middle line:84%
You were really, really
working hard academically.

00:35:12.476 --> 00:35:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And I had
some girlfriends,

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:15.597 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't want
to get to close.

00:35:15.597 --> 00:35:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
wouldn't let them close.

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:20.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Because I had made an
experience that was so painful.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.310 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to live
through it again.

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that I didn't
have a strong relationship

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:31.840 align:middle line:84%
with anybody at the time
the KGB recruited me,

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.060 align:middle line:90%
that was one of the--

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a criteria.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And it helped
me just disappear.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.330 align:middle line:84%
I had nothing that kept
me, nothing strong enough

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:43.955 align:middle line:90%
to keep me back in Germany.

00:35:43.955 --> 00:35:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No emotional ties.

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:45.662 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: That's correct.

00:35:45.662 --> 00:35:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Not my mother--

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.572 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
really critical.

00:35:47.572 --> 00:35:50.445 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: --and not
with a female interest.

00:35:50.445 --> 00:35:54.250 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So now, let's get to
that part where the KGB has--

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:58.620 align:middle line:10%
how they started reaching
out to you initially

00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:59.742 align:middle line:10%
and what drew you in.

00:35:59.742 --> 00:36:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Because there were
some things that

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.195 align:middle line:84%
sounded pretty
titillating and wonderful.

00:36:03.195 --> 00:36:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Well, yeah, in the
US, you had your James Bond.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.380 align:middle line:84%
We had our version
of James Bond.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.050 align:middle line:90%


00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:18.460 align:middle line:84%
We called them
"Scouts for Peace."

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:21.210 align:middle line:84%
That was the East German
spies that primarily

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:24.600 align:middle line:84%
would go into the
West and do some work

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:29.310 align:middle line:84%
to uncover fascists
and just, like,

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:31.650 align:middle line:90%
help us protect ourselves.

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.600 align:middle line:84%
There were also some
historic figures

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.850 align:middle line:84%
that are mostly communist
that had spied or fought

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:39.780 align:middle line:90%
for the Soviet Union.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:43.290 align:middle line:84%
It was a famous
spy, Richard Sorge,

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:48.110 align:middle line:84%
who was a German communist
that was a journalist in Japan.

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And he sent extremely
valuable information

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:55.370 align:middle line:84%
to the Soviet Union,
which Stalin ignored.

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And when he was
caught, Stalin denied

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.825 align:middle line:84%
that they ever had a connection
until he was executed.

00:37:01.825 --> 00:37:03.450 align:middle line:84%
That part of the
story, we didn't know.

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:06.390 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, there
was a romantic notion

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:10.530 align:middle line:84%
about folks like that
who would go and do

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:14.040 align:middle line:84%
this heroic stuff
in the West while,

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.780 align:middle line:90%
also, enjoying the good life.

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.000 align:middle line:84%
But that came with
the territory.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.520 align:middle line:84%
So when that was presented
to me, I said, wow.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You could see how
the higher ups in the party

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:25.970 align:middle line:90%
were living anyway.

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:28.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they did have
certain perks, right?

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: It wasn't
that obvious.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.380 align:middle line:90%
It was reasonably well managed.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: You had to
be really high up.

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:10%
Like, for instance, the local
party officials, most of

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.060 align:middle line:10%
them were--

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.140 align:middle line:10%
there was part time, and
even if it was full time,

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.740 align:middle line:10%
they didn't get the perks.

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:48.540 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't really--

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you weren't
exposed to the high-ups yet?

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: No.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK, so now--

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.713 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Actually, I was
never exposed to the high-ups.

00:37:54.713 --> 00:37:58.450 align:middle line:84%
I never knew how high on
the hog the elite of the KGB

00:37:58.450 --> 00:37:59.400 align:middle line:90%
was living in Moscow.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:03.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we read about it here.

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So for you, you
have paid your dues.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.190 align:middle line:90%
You're loyal to the party.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:09.810 align:middle line:90%
And now, they reach out to you.

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Talk about how they
originally reached out to you.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Yeah,
that was as awkward

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:19.020 align:middle line:84%
as it could get because the
fellow that initially made

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.930 align:middle line:84%
contact with me
on a Saturday, he

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:25.200 align:middle line:84%
knocked on the door of
my college dorm room

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and introduced himself
as a representative

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:34.140 align:middle line:84%
of the local, world-famous
optics factory.

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And he was going to talk
to me about my plans after

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:43.860 align:middle line:84%
graduation, which was totally
stupid because anybody who knew

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:47.770 align:middle line:84%
anything about that system
in those days knew that you

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:48.570 align:middle line:90%
don't--

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:49.890 align:middle line:90%
nobody recruited.

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:51.510 align:middle line:84%
You weren't recruited
out of college.

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:52.310 align:middle line:90%
You were assigned.

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: So it was
all centrally planned.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So the moment he said that, I
knew that he was full of it.

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And I also guessed, rightly,
that he was probably Stasi.

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.070 align:middle line:90%
He was German.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:09.120 align:middle line:84%
It turns out he most likely was
a collaborator with the KGB.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.190 align:middle line:90%
They had their own local guys.

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And this was an
interesting Kabuki dance

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:22.170 align:middle line:84%
because I knew that he wasn't
who he pretended to be,

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:25.320 align:middle line:84%
but he probably didn't know
that his lie didn't work.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.480 align:middle line:90%
So I was playing with him.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.610 align:middle line:84%
I could have, at any point,
made him look really foolish,

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:31.410 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't.

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:34.020 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to know
where he's going--

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:34.835 align:middle line:90%
curiosity.

00:39:34.835 --> 00:39:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually,
he came out

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:39.510 align:middle line:84%
with this question,
where he said--

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:42.900 align:middle line:84%
he admitted, look, I'm
really not from that company.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.420 align:middle line:90%


00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm working with the government.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Could you imagine yourself
to work for the government

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:52.800 align:middle line:90%
one of these days?

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I gave him the answer
that he wanted, without us ever

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:00.840 align:middle line:84%
determining what part of
the government that was.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.050 align:middle line:84%
I said, yes, but
not as a chemist.

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And so he had the answer
that he wanted, so he

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:12.340 align:middle line:84%
went back to his boss there and
said, the guy's ready to talk.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And the next time,
he introduced me

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.230 align:middle line:84%
to somebody who spoke German
with a Russian accent.

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And unceremoniously,
he introduced him.

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, this is Herman,
and we're working

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:24.620 align:middle line:90%
with our Soviet friends.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And before you know
it, he said goodbye.

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:28.157 align:middle line:90%
I never knew this guy's name.

00:40:28.157 --> 00:40:29.240 align:middle line:90%
And now I was with Herman.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.230 align:middle line:90%
I was with the KGB--

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:31.700 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3.

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:32.990 align:middle line:90%
You know, what?

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:35.960 align:middle line:84%
The KGB was the most powerful--
and it probably, in history,

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.720 align:middle line:84%
has been the most
powerful intelligence

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.330 align:middle line:90%
agency in the world.

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was part of the Soviet
Union, the mighty Soviet Union,

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.395 align:middle line:90%
and they wanted me.

00:40:46.395 --> 00:40:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
very flattering.

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Flattery,
flattery gets you very far.

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:51.727 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because as you
say in your own book,

00:40:51.727 --> 00:40:54.030 align:middle line:84%
you were not a particularly
humble young man.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: No, no.

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You knew
you were good.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.080 align:middle line:90%
You knew you were smart.

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.970 align:middle line:84%
You know you were kind
of full of yourself.

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: I was.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:03.780 align:middle line:90%
I didn't express it openly.

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, because you
did have a certain charisma

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.240 align:middle line:90%
and gentility.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Yeah, I
was pretty likable.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:13.670 align:middle line:84%
But internally, I
knew I was the best.

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was fed into
me from all sides.

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Even when I messed up, the party
officials chose to ignore it.

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:23.360 align:middle line:84%
I fathered a child
out of wedlock.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I should have been
reprimanded in a big way.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever even mentioned this
because I was a rising star.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.060 align:middle line:90%
So now, the KGB comes in.

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.590 align:middle line:90%
This is the next level.

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:36.712 align:middle line:84%
You got to at least
figure out what that is.

00:41:36.712 --> 00:41:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
even in your original

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:41.780 align:middle line:84%
meetings where you
would be taken,

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:45.630 align:middle line:84%
you had lovely tea
and biscuits, and you

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:47.630 align:middle line:84%
were allowed to even read
Western magazines now.

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: That's right.

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This was a big deal.

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: I was allowed to
live outside of the law,

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:55.730 align:middle line:84%
outside of the rules,
because I was never

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.110 align:middle line:90%
really comfortable with rules.

00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'd go to read Der
Spiegel so you could find out

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:03.100 align:middle line:84%
what was happening in Germany
and the whole Western world.

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:04.850 align:middle line:90%
That's their Time magazine.

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Right, and
as time progressed,

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I was encouraged to learn as
much as possible about the West

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:15.680 align:middle line:84%
because I was going to
operate there, right?

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So that put me in another
special category of people who

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:22.410 align:middle line:90%
could live outside of the law.

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:24.080 align:middle line:84%
You have your cake
and eat it, too.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right?

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.370 align:middle line:84%
This is, of course,
intellectually dishonest,

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:30.740 align:middle line:90%
but who cares?

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.160 align:middle line:84%
The selfish part of me
really enjoyed that.

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you're
a young man untethered,

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and you're being flattered
at every single level,

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.700 align:middle line:84%
getting access to things
other people that you know

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.700 align:middle line:90%
would never have access to.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.585 align:middle line:84%
So you can understand what the
appeal would be to a young man.

00:42:44.585 --> 00:42:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Absolutely, yeah.

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And dialed back-- people ask
me, would you do it again?

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And I say, knowing
what I knew then

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.401 align:middle line:84%
and being who I was
then, absolutely.

00:42:57.401 --> 00:42:59.026 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, sure
you'd do it again.

00:42:59.026 --> 00:42:59.840 align:middle line:90%
It's your right.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And most people
probably would have,

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:05.390 align:middle line:90%
given the same opportunity.

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And you already
kind of passed over,

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:11.060 align:middle line:84%
but you had this child out
of wedlock as well, right?

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And now, the party,
interestingly

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:17.330 align:middle line:84%
because you were
who you were, let

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:20.625 align:middle line:84%
you have a relationship, which
that's not usually desirable.

00:43:20.625 --> 00:43:22.305 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Now we're
going forward.

00:43:22.305 --> 00:43:23.105 align:middle line:90%
That was the KGB.

00:43:23.105 --> 00:43:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were KGB.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I want to start getting into
that, into the KGB part now.

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:28.490 align:middle line:90%
So you're out of school.

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:31.370 align:middle line:90%


00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:32.690 align:middle line:90%
Give us the chronology on this.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:34.400 align:middle line:90%
Because at one point--

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.793 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you were
still in school.

00:43:35.793 --> 00:43:37.460 align:middle line:84%
They'd have you kind
of give information

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:40.350 align:middle line:84%
on some of your fellow
students, observe them, see

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:42.250 align:middle line:84%
what you could give,
who's potentially

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:44.630 align:middle line:90%
a problem or a gain, whatever.

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:45.580 align:middle line:90%
So you had to do that.

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Now how does that feel?

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.150 align:middle line:84%
These were your friends
or, at least, colleagues.

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Well, I
thought it was OK.

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:57.350 align:middle line:84%
I never really wrote a
lot of derogatory things.

00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:00.502 align:middle line:84%
I believe this was
mostly training because--

00:44:00.502 --> 00:44:01.835 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Powers of observation.

00:44:01.835 --> 00:44:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Yeah, the Stasi did
a good job watching everybody,

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.680 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think that
the KGB was very much

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.790 align:middle line:84%
interested in the
internals of East Germany.

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:17.990 align:middle line:84%
So for instance,
when my friend and I

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:20.400 align:middle line:84%
hitchhiked across
Eastern Europe,

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.890 align:middle line:84%
I had to write a report
about each country.

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:27.590 align:middle line:84%
This was -- they just wanted
to see my analytical abilities,

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and my ability to read
people, and all that.

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, I wouldn't
do something like that.

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.420 align:middle line:84%
But in those days, to
me, that was, again--

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It didn't
feel creepy back then.

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Even if I wrote
about somebody who--

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:43.790 align:middle line:84%
most of us students were
toeing the line, like 90%.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And there was some
troublemakers.

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And the troublemakers had
to be dealt with, right?

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.180 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't feel bad about it.

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:54.800 align:middle line:84%
But that is part of the answer,
where good Germans actually

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.740 align:middle line:84%
went along with Hitler because
there were troublemakers there,

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:00.050 align:middle line:84%
too, and they had
to be dealt with.

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And they sort of were
working on destroying

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:06.300 align:middle line:90%
the collective vision, right?

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And you're now in the
Soviet version of that.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yep.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now travel
and exploring other lands

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:19.108 align:middle line:84%
in the name of the work has
been dangled before you.

00:45:19.108 --> 00:45:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And you're gonna get
to leave East Germany.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:22.577 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a big deal.

00:45:22.577 --> 00:45:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And they started
training you slowly.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.440 align:middle line:84%
I was very interested in
a couple of things there.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.560 align:middle line:84%
One, you get to pass through the
wall and go into West Germany.

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:33.867 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Right, that
was a training trip.

00:45:33.867 --> 00:45:35.075 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What an eye-opener.

00:45:35.075 --> 00:45:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: That was actually
a very critical moment

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:42.248 align:middle line:84%
because not everybody
actually could do that--

00:45:42.248 --> 00:45:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that
was interesting.

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: --and survive.

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:46.368 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why could
they not-- because it

00:45:46.368 --> 00:45:48.590 align:middle line:84%
blew their perceptions of
life and it just destroyed

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:50.040 align:middle line:90%
everything they had believed?

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:53.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: No, you would
have to ask my classmate

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Hans [INAUDIBLE],,
who I met in Berlin

00:45:56.750 --> 00:46:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and who shared with
me that he actually

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:04.310 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to go to West
Germany as an undercover agent

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:06.080 align:middle line:90%
on behalf of the Stasi.

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And when he made his
first trip to West Berlin,

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.540 align:middle line:84%
he came back and
says, I can't do this.

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:16.310 align:middle line:90%
It's too much pressure.

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:17.728 align:middle line:90%
This was enemy territory.

00:46:17.728 --> 00:46:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, no.

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:20.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we don't get-- this is--

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:22.715 align:middle line:84%
truly, you're going into
the den of the devil.

00:46:22.715 --> 00:46:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: The unknown.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.960 align:middle line:90%
So as I emerged from--

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.760 align:middle line:90%
there was a connection.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:31.160 align:middle line:84%
You could go by a subway
from east to west,

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.540 align:middle line:84%
except you had to
pass by a KGB--

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which you were
authorized to do, yeah.

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right.

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:41.300 align:middle line:84%
So as I emerged in Western
territory and I saw my first--

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:43.460 align:middle line:84%
the first policeman
in uniform, I thought,

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:45.788 align:middle line:90%
he should know that I'm not--

00:46:45.788 --> 00:46:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Arrest you, shoot
you, something on the spot.

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:48.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:49.945 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Whatever, yeah.

00:46:49.945 --> 00:46:52.080 align:middle line:90%
And the first trip was nothing.

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:55.368 align:middle line:84%
It was just, go there,
walk around, take a trip--

00:46:55.368 --> 00:46:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have some
sausage and beer.

00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: [LAUGHS] Have
sausage and beer and come back.

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:00.850 align:middle line:90%
And then, how did it go?

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:02.330 align:middle line:90%
It was OK.

00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:06.290 align:middle line:84%
It was a very important
test because we were, like,

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:09.165 align:middle line:84%
so trained that everything
over there is really bad.

00:47:09.165 --> 00:47:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Evil, yeah.

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: And evil.

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you said
something really interesting.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:17.240 align:middle line:84%
You said, once this
happened and you came back,

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:20.630 align:middle line:84%
it was though you went from
a world in black and white

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:21.620 align:middle line:90%
to one in color.

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:22.578 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: [LAUGHS] Yes.

00:47:22.578 --> 00:47:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You saw light.

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:27.720 align:middle line:84%
You saw people moving freely,
having high-quality foods

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:28.520 align:middle line:90%
and automobiles.

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Yeah,
the contrast was--

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:33.360 align:middle line:90%
it just hit you.

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.720 align:middle line:84%
You could not possibly
overlook that.

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And I've met other people who
went mostly from West to East

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:42.863 align:middle line:90%
in those days.

00:47:42.863 --> 00:47:44.030 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have enough paint.

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:45.197 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have enough color.

00:47:45.197 --> 00:47:46.820 align:middle line:90%
It was all brown and gray.

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.000 align:middle line:90%
And at night, it was dark.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And I go
over there and, like,

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:53.650 align:middle line:84%
even the policemen uniforms,
they were light blue.

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:54.650 align:middle line:90%
They looked pretty nice.

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And so, I mean, it's hard
for us to understand this

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:00.800 align:middle line:84%
because anyone who was
born in America-- and i

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.880 align:middle line:84%
mean, you just take all of
this for granted, of course.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Sure.

00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:04.090 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:06.620 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So you went into this
color world, you came back,

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:08.540 align:middle line:10%
you weren't killed,
nobody recognized you

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.230 align:middle line:10%
as anything other than a young
German man, you spoke German.

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And your name, at the time, your
birth name, Albrecht, right?

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: I went
with my real name,

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:20.765 align:middle line:84%
with a real East German
passport where you--

00:48:20.765 --> 00:48:23.750 align:middle line:84%
it had an entry, allowed
to travel to the West.

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:25.510 align:middle line:90%
And your name was?

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:26.677 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Albrecht Dittrich.

00:48:26.677 --> 00:48:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dittrich.

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.310 align:middle line:90%
I can't say the last name right.

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Say it again.

00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:31.360 align:middle line:90%
I want to see if I can get it.

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Al-brecht.

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That part, I can get.

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:34.543 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Dit-trich.

00:48:34.543 --> 00:48:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dittrich.

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah, Not bad.

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:39.530 align:middle line:90%
So that's who you were born as.

00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So, OK, you pass the
muster, OK, you did it.

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:44.690 align:middle line:10%
You came back.

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:45.980 align:middle line:90%
Now, things intensify.

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:48.010 align:middle line:90%
Now, the KGB is interested.

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:49.760 align:middle line:84%
At what point did you
understand they were

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.280 align:middle line:90%
preparing you to go to America?

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: That
was serendipitous.

00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:59.810 align:middle line:84%
I was told that everybody
who was being prepared

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:02.773 align:middle line:84%
for an illegal existence
in another country

00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:04.190 align:middle line:84%
had to learn yet
another language.

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And I was
given the choice.

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And since English was
really super easy for me

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:13.830 align:middle line:84%
in high school,
I picked English.

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:17.000 align:middle line:90%
And so I threw myself into--

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.520 align:middle line:84%
in those days, whatever
I tackled, I went 110%--

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and I threw myself
into studying English.

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.630 align:middle line:90%
First, I had a couple of tutors.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.360 align:middle line:90%
And then, I did it on my own.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.460 align:middle line:84%
I would read two,
three hours a day.

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And every new word that
I found, I would learn.

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And so one day, I had a visitor
from the center, which is

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Moscow, this in headquarters.

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking,
and he asked me about,

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:47.720 align:middle line:90%
how's your English?

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:51.752 align:middle line:84%
And I pulled a book out written
in English, and it was a novel.

00:49:51.752 --> 00:49:53.710 align:middle line:84%
I said, I can read this
without the dictionary.

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:55.590 align:middle line:90%
He said, ooh.

00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:56.750 align:middle line:90%
So a light went up on him.

00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:59.390 align:middle line:84%
So next thing is I
get a tape recorder,

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:04.460 align:middle line:84%
and they ask me to say
something in English.

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And even in those days, even
though I had a much heavier

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:10.160 align:middle line:90%
accent, but my accent was--

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.978 align:middle line:84%
I had the ability
to emulate sounds.

00:50:11.978 --> 00:50:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, just
mimic the sound.

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:15.545 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Mimic sounds.

00:50:15.545 --> 00:50:17.610 align:middle line:90%
I mimicked German comedians.

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I had this innate ability to
speak sort of like others.

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the accent was
significantly less than what

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:27.180 align:middle line:90%
you would expect from a German.

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:31.590 align:middle line:84%
They took this to some
teachers in Moscow,

00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:34.770 align:middle line:84%
and they said, let's bring
him over here and test him.

00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:39.750 align:middle line:84%
So next thing, I'm on a plane
to Moscow, my first flight.

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And I get to talk to a couple
of people, one an American,

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and another one a
college teacher,

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.520 align:middle line:90%
a Russian who taught English.

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
back and forth.

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:51.600 align:middle line:90%
And then, they made a decision.

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:52.830 align:middle line:90%
And it was a tie.

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:55.440 align:middle line:84%
One said you can't do it;
the other one said you can.

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And wishful thinking took
over and says, give it a try.

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is when they moved
me to Moscow to train,

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:07.245 align:middle line:84%
primarily to learn English
as well as one can,

00:51:07.245 --> 00:51:10.347 align:middle line:84%
to be then launched
to the United States.

00:51:10.347 --> 00:51:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this went on for
a long time and longer than you

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:13.730 align:middle line:90%
expected.

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:15.105 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Two years.

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And this was like
a promotion to me.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.818 align:middle line:84%
There were hundreds of agents
of East Germans in the West.

00:51:20.818 --> 00:51:22.110 align:middle line:90%
I would have been one of those.

00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:23.693 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was going to
be really special.

00:51:23.693 --> 00:51:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So you moved to Moscow, the
intense training begins,

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:30.203 align:middle line:90%
you're treated in a special way.

00:51:30.203 --> 00:51:31.620 align:middle line:84%
As a young man,
you even get to go

00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:34.250 align:middle line:84%
to the Bolshoi Ballet, things
the average person can't ever

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:35.850 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:39.303 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Right, and I cut in
front of the line to see Lenin.

00:51:39.303 --> 00:51:40.148 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ah.

00:51:40.148 --> 00:51:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: That line was--

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, oh, yeah.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: As an
ordinary human being,

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:47.850 align:middle line:84%
you would line up at the end,
and it would take almost a day

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:48.990 align:middle line:90%
to get in to get there.

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:50.430 align:middle line:90%
We would-- right in the front.

00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were
really special now.

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Sure.

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
were starting to enjoy

00:51:54.330 --> 00:51:56.372 align:middle line:84%
some of the perks of life
as well by the time you

00:51:56.372 --> 00:51:58.627 align:middle line:90%
get to Russia a little bit.

00:51:58.627 --> 00:52:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Only what
we just mentioned.

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just the Bolshoi?

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Well,
you know, there was

00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:07.245 align:middle line:84%
a big, negative kind of
weight, and it was loneliness.

00:52:07.245 --> 00:52:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no doubt.

00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right?

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:11.130 align:middle line:10%
>>BARSKY: I was all
by myself, and I

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:14.910 align:middle line:10%
wasn't supposed to become
friends with people there.

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:17.070 align:middle line:84%
The only interaction
with other human beings

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:18.550 align:middle line:90%
was in the context of training.

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:24.117 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And initially, the
apartment that they had me in

00:52:24.117 --> 00:52:25.200 align:middle line:90%
wasn't that great, either.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.120 align:middle line:90%
But eventually, I got a really--

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:30.680 align:middle line:90%


00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:33.360 align:middle line:84%
given Soviet conditions, I
got a really nice apartment

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.790 align:middle line:90%
with a color TV.

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:37.080 align:middle line:90%
It was way too big for me.

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Yes, by comparison, I
was really well treated.

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Food, I still had to
take care of myself,

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.680 align:middle line:84%
and there weren't a whole lot
of things you could buy and eat

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:47.480 align:middle line:90%
in the stores.

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My whole family
went over to Russia

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:51.120 align:middle line:84%
during that period of
time during the Cold War.

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:54.910 align:middle line:84%
My parents went, my sister,
my niece, my brother in law.

00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:57.540 align:middle line:84%
They all went during
that time and came back.

00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:58.950 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to bring gifts.

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And they brought me this
horrible toothpaste.

00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there wasn't
anything to bring.

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.610 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, here's
some of their toothpaste,

00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:07.950 align:middle line:84%
just to see kind of
what the life is like.

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:11.490 align:middle line:84%
I just remember being
shocked at just how bad it

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:14.460 align:middle line:84%
was in terms of
availability of food

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:17.040 align:middle line:90%
stuffs and any other supplies.

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Their version
of the supermarket

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:25.390 align:middle line:84%
was significantly poorer than
what we had in East Germany.

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was sort
of the equivalent

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:32.970 align:middle line:84%
of the gray and brown in terms
of the way East Germany looked

00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:35.580 align:middle line:90%
when you came from the West.

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Huge spaces stocked with
mineral water and can't fish.

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And occasionally, they
had something else.

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:45.900 align:middle line:90%
I remember hearing that.

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.465 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: The only good thing
that you could get everyday

00:53:48.465 --> 00:53:49.265 align:middle line:90%
was bread.

00:53:49.265 --> 00:53:50.182 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bread, yeah.

00:53:50.182 --> 00:53:51.437 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Freshly baked bread.

00:53:51.437 --> 00:53:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, well, thank god.

00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:54.145 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And it
was really good.

00:53:54.145 --> 00:53:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Any butter?

00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:57.437 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily?

00:53:57.437 --> 00:53:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Depending on
what day of the week.

00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I had
it written down here.

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Including your training,
you had to really learn

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:07.320 align:middle line:90%
about how you go undetected.

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So this whole
movement that spies--

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:11.550 align:middle line:84%
this is where it gets
intriguing for those of us

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:13.920 align:middle line:84%
who devour shows
like "The Americans"

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and every other spy
show, and John le Carre

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:20.180 align:middle line:84%
novel, and everything else,
is the actual craft training

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:21.910 align:middle line:90%
had started at this time.

00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:24.043 align:middle line:84%
And you had people
following you, right?

00:54:24.043 --> 00:54:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right, yeah.

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also at this time,
you were studying Morse code,

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:32.280 align:middle line:84%
secret writing, photography,
cryptography, dead drops,

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.650 align:middle line:84%
all the things we've read
about in our spy novels that--

00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: It's all real.

00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:36.847 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's all real.

00:54:36.847 --> 00:54:38.430 align:middle line:84%
So you were classically
trained in all

00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:39.930 align:middle line:90%
of that at the same time.

00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And you seemed to have
a knack for the ability

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:47.110 align:middle line:84%
to go undetected and
also a really high skill

00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:49.800 align:middle line:84%
at observation to know
when someone was there

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:51.120 align:middle line:90%
and something was out of order.

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So you were really a rock
star at this in your training.

00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: The person who
trained me was probably one

00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:03.250 align:middle line:90%
of the top surveillance folks.

00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And he worked with a whole
team or multiple teams.

00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, he
paid me the compliment,

00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:13.290 align:middle line:84%
he says that I was one of
the best he ever worked with.

00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And it had something
to do with my ability

00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:20.260 align:middle line:90%
to remember faces.

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:23.040 align:middle line:90%
See, this is how this works.

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:26.580 align:middle line:90%
When you are being followed--

00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:28.920 align:middle line:84%
and, typically, the size
of the team that follows

00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:32.790 align:middle line:84%
you could be anywhere between a
half a dozen to a dozen folks,

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:36.810 align:middle line:84%
and they would change positions
as to who's the closest, right?

00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:38.490 align:middle line:84%
But there are
situations-- and you

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:41.790 align:middle line:84%
have find the places
where they must come

00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:45.120 align:middle line:90%
close to see what you're up to.

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.400 align:middle line:90%
Because 10 seconds of--

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.980 align:middle line:84%
when you're out of sight,
you could be doing something,

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.368 align:middle line:84%
and they never
know what you did.

00:55:51.368 --> 00:55:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, make a--

00:55:52.410 --> 00:55:53.210 align:middle line:90%
pass off--

00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes.

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The detail
and awareness, I mean,

00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:01.470 align:middle line:84%
that's what really got me
is the amount of detail

00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:02.850 align:middle line:90%
that they put you through.

00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes.

00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, but I was one
of only 10 that they

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:10.020 align:middle line:90%
trained in that time frame.

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And the head of department
S, which is illegals--

00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:19.620 align:middle line:84%
once you retired and the
Soviet Union was no more,

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:23.460 align:middle line:84%
gave an interview, where he
was talking about illegals.

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we literally
scanned hundreds of candidates.

00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And even the ones that made
it to the list of finalists,

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:34.010 align:middle line:84%
even many of those didn't
work out in the end.

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:35.176 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:35.176 --> 00:56:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: It is what it is.

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:38.632 align:middle line:90%
I'm not bragging.

00:56:38.632 --> 00:56:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you
were that bright.

00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:42.570 align:middle line:90%
You were the best and brightest.

00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And some of that
was just not acquired.

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:48.990 align:middle line:10%
It was given to me, like the
ability to remember faces,

00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:49.950 align:middle line:10%
getting back to--

00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:53.610 align:middle line:10%
if you saw the same face
twice, regardless of what else

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:56.367 align:middle line:10%
they were wearing and whether
they had different hair,

00:56:56.367 --> 00:56:58.200 align:middle line:10%
you knew that somebody
was following-- twice

00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.005 align:middle line:10%
within three hours.

00:56:59.005 --> 00:57:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: And now, I'm bragging.

00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:03.030 align:middle line:90%
This was a contest.

00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: This team was
training for themselves

00:57:06.210 --> 00:57:09.670 align:middle line:84%
because they were training to,
for instance, follow CIA folks

00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and they wanted
to be not detected, right?

00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:15.250 align:middle line:84%
So they were writing a report,
and I was writing a report.

00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:17.188 align:middle line:90%
And in the end, it was team 0--

00:57:17.188 --> 00:57:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was a competition.

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Team 0, me 10.

00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:19.830 --> 00:57:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: I beat
them every time.

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is where we're

00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:25.440 align:middle line:84%
going to end the first
part of the conversation,

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:29.760 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going to pick up
the second part, where, OK, you

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:30.870 align:middle line:90%
passed.

00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:32.610 align:middle line:90%
You're the best and brightest.

00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, they sent you
off to Canada first

00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:39.180 align:middle line:84%
to get to the quote kind of
"America light" lifestyle.

00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And then, you meet situations
you'd never encountered,

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:45.630 align:middle line:84%
where you just absolutely
had a cold sweat.

00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of them had to do with
twist-off bottle caps on a beer

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:50.360 align:middle line:90%
bottle.

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to pick that
story up when we come back.

00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:54.492 align:middle line:90%
It's been an absolute delight.

00:57:54.492 --> 00:57:55.950 align:middle line:84%
It was a delight
reading your book.

00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:57.952 align:middle line:84%
It's been a delight
talking with you.

00:57:57.952 --> 00:58:00.285 align:middle line:84%
And I very much look forward
to our second conversation.

00:58:00.285 --> 00:58:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Same here.

00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:01.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:03.810 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: As you can tell,
we could talk for hours more.

00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:05.602 align:middle line:10%
At least, we get one
more hour out of this.

00:58:05.602 --> 00:58:07.350 align:middle line:10%
So to get the
story yourself, you

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.120 align:middle line:10%
can go purchase
"Deep Undercover"

00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:10.950 align:middle line:10%
at any major bookseller.

00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:14.880 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:19.430 align:middle line:90%
