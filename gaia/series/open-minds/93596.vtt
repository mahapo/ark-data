>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Philip K. Dick

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.550 align:middle line:90%
was a man who saw the future.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.670 align:middle line:10%
Back in the 1950s, he
warned of a darkening time

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.780 align:middle line:10%
in history of surveillance
and corporatocracy.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Anthony Peake has
chronicled his life

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.710 align:middle line:84%
in a book titled "Philip
K. Dick: The Man Who

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.822 align:middle line:90%
Remembered the Future."

00:00:26.286 --> 00:00:44.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anthony,
one of the-- I mean,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.720 align:middle line:84%
you're known for your
studies in consciousness,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.870 align:middle line:90%
in physics and the interface.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.712 align:middle line:84%
And why did you decide to do
a biography, to start with?

00:00:54.712 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Give us a little bit
of background on you

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.480 align:middle line:84%
for those who aren't
already aware of your work.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:10%
>>ANTHONY PEAKE: OK,
well, I've written

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.890 align:middle line:10%
a series of books, mostly
about the interfaces,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.879 align:middle line:10%
you say, between
consciousness and reality,

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.170 align:middle line:10%
because it's something that's
always fascinated me ever

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.990 align:middle line:10%
since I was a child, really.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was fortunate enough
to get a book deal around

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.080 align:middle line:84%
about nine years ago
for my first book,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.770 align:middle line:84%
"Is There Life
After Death?," which

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.206 align:middle line:84%
takes a radical new
approach to consciousness

00:01:17.206 --> 00:01:18.830 align:middle line:84%
and what happens to
human consciousness

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.550 align:middle line:90%
at point of death.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.410 align:middle line:84%
My second book,
"The Daemon: A Guide

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.745 align:middle line:84%
to Extraordinary Secret
Self," particularly focused

00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:27.330 align:middle line:84%
in on the idea of human duality
and the idea of the higher

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.270 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.460 align:middle line:84%
But I always take the
approach of doing the science,

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:84%
so I was doing the
neurological aspects,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.790 align:middle line:84%
the neurochemical
aspects of such an idea.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.670 align:middle line:10%
And it was then that I
started to become fascinated,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.290 align:middle line:10%
or re-fascinated, with the
work of Philip K. Dick.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And the final chapter
of that particular book,

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.240 align:middle line:84%
"The Owl in Daylight,"
deals with Philip K.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Dick and some
extraordinary events

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.820 align:middle line:90%
that happened during his life.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of my publishers
who said, do you know what?

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.510 align:middle line:84%
We think that the world needs
a new biography of Philip K.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.257 align:middle line:84%
Dick, particularly taking
it from your angle, which

00:01:58.257 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
is subtly different from what
the other biographers have

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.390 align:middle line:90%
done.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm also a
qualified psychometrician,

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:84%
so I was able to analyze Phil
psychometrically as well.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.229 align:middle line:84%
Because I was in the
fortunate position

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.890 align:middle line:84%
of being able to get
across some raw scores

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
of a psychometric profile
that Phil did in the 1950s

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:90%
for Raymond Cattell.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Because Raymond Cattell was
the inventor of the 16PF.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And Cattell had approached
around about 80 or 90 writers,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.329 align:middle line:90%
and Phil actually responded.

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And therefore I was in
a wonderful position

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.280 align:middle line:84%
of being able to actually get a
little bit more into his head.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.337 align:middle line:90%
And it went from there, really.

00:02:33.337 --> 00:02:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've spent
how long in his head?

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Oh, around
about 18 months.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:90%
But I think I've spent more--

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.058 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's such an
unusual head to spend time in.

00:02:40.058 --> 00:02:42.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously your
interest is-- your background

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:90%
is in sociology, history.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:84%
You span way out into the
quantum realms as well.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that this
man was able to bridge

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.580 align:middle line:84%
the gap between
all that and more.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.663 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- we're going
to get into some of that.

00:02:56.663 --> 00:02:58.440 align:middle line:84%
This man had an
extraordinary ability.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.660 align:middle line:90%
But he was highly nuanced.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.820 align:middle line:84%
He had a really challenged
life at the same time.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: He certainly did.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did that do to
your life to be in his head?

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: I felt quite
curious sometimes.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I went through the
circumstances of admiring him

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.520 align:middle line:84%
beyond-- intellectually
admiring him

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.980 align:middle line:84%
and at the same
time wondering, why

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.710 align:middle line:84%
on Earth did you do
that in that way?

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:84%
He did very, very strange
things in his life.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.250 align:middle line:90%
He made very curious decisions.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And he was very needy
in many, many ways.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.519 align:middle line:84%
In many ways he was also a very
sad person and a lonely person.

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
we're going to get

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.450 align:middle line:84%
into what happened from
the beginning in his life.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:90%
What set him up for that?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Effectively
his birth, in the sense

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.210 align:middle line:84%
that he was born in Chicago in
extremely cold winter in 1928.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And circumstances were
that he was born as twins.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And his sister
Jane unfortunately

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.930 align:middle line:84%
died around about six,
eight weeks later.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So Phil spent his whole
life missing a part of him.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And one can only imagine
that that situation worsened

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.540 align:middle line:84%
when his parents split up, and
Phil's mom moved to California,

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.040 align:middle line:84%
leaving Phil an only child with
a highly intelligent but very,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.590 align:middle line:90%
very complex mother.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:84%
And Phil's relationship
with his mother was curious,

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.456 align:middle line:90%
was difficult sometimes as well.

00:04:20.456 --> 00:04:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Didn't he feel
that she was somehow

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.090 align:middle line:84%
responsible in her own care
and her care of the babies

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.120 align:middle line:84%
that she didn't really do
the best she could have

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and that the sister died at
the hand of her own neglect?

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Correct.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.370 align:middle line:84%
In many interviews, he claimed
that it was his mother's fault

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and that he blamed
her in some way.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.328 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that would set up
a very complex relationship.

00:04:40.328 --> 00:04:41.790 align:middle line:84%
He's missing his
other half, and he

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.130 align:middle line:90%
feels his mother was to blame.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: It would, indeed.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The father
is gone, and that's

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.910 align:middle line:84%
going to come up later
in the conversation.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.912 align:middle line:90%
He found another one.

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Yes, it's
a classic-- it's

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.220 align:middle line:84%
a very classic psychometric
profile in many, many ways.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
what happened to him.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Then the father--
by the age of five,

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.229 align:middle line:90%
the father was gone, right?

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Yes.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now,
as life goes on,

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:84%
he's starting to have higher
and higher levels of anxiety.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Obviously he was
a very sensitive

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.889 align:middle line:90%
being born into this life.

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: As an
interesting aside here

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:84%
is that I also discovered
that his sister-- his mother's

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:84%
sister-- I think is Marion--
was also a psychic, which again

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:84%
brings in some very
interesting aspects in terms

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.250 align:middle line:90%
of Phil's life.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.833 align:middle line:84%
And he was very,
very close to Marion,

00:05:24.833 --> 00:05:27.180 align:middle line:84%
who also died
comparatively young.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:84%
But as a child, he was clearly
highly intelligent but in a way

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.750 align:middle line:84%
that probably the
society of that time

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
couldn't really
accommodate in that he

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.150 align:middle line:84%
was interested in so
many different things.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And to tie that kind of mind
down to one particular area

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.320 align:middle line:90%
is very difficult.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.310 align:middle line:84%
But on top of that, he
started to have very, very

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:90%
curious subjective sensations.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.316 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he suffered from
something called micropsia,

00:05:54.316 --> 00:05:56.440 align:middle line:84%
which is effectively he
felt that he would actually

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.450 align:middle line:84%
become smaller and
smaller and smaller

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.414 align:middle line:90%
or he'd feel himself expanding.

00:06:00.414 --> 00:06:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And in my book, I discuss
this in some detail.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.500 align:middle line:84%
It's actually called the
Alice in Wonderland syndrome.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.041 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
I was going to say

00:06:06.041 --> 00:06:07.840 align:middle line:84%
that's not uncommon
for people who also

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.440 align:middle line:84%
are either meditating or
have this multidimensional

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.240 align:middle line:90%
awareness.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.460 align:middle line:84%
This sense of expansion
and contraction

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.650 align:middle line:90%
is actually quite normal.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it had to be turned
into a medical condition.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Of course,
and that's the issue.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, effectively
there is certain evidence

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.980 align:middle line:84%
to say that he could've
been a classic migrainer.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Because as a classic migrainer
myself, I know as a child

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.080 align:middle line:84%
I had that kind of expanding
feeling and contracting

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.280 align:middle line:90%
sensation.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.410 align:middle line:84%
But Phil felt it
was actually almost

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.510 align:middle line:90%
disassociating from reality.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that very
early stage in his life

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:84%
that he became fascinated by
the interface between reality,

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.735 align:middle line:84%
what he perceived to be
reality, and what is reality.

00:06:45.735 --> 00:06:47.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he had a
curious conversation

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:90%
when he was a teenager.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.290 align:middle line:84%
He worked in a record
store, an electrical store.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And he had a
fascinating conversation

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.010 align:middle line:84%
once with a group of his fellow
workers about perception.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And he was discussing,
as many of us think,

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.660 align:middle line:84%
that you perceive
the color red--

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.020 align:middle line:84%
how do I know that your
perception of color red

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.560 align:middle line:90%
is identical to mine?

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are very, very
deep, philosophical concepts

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.540 align:middle line:84%
for a young man to be
thinking about at that age.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.110 align:middle line:84%
So clearly he was thinking-- I
hate the term out of the box--

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.040 align:middle line:90%
even at that stage.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I understand.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.792 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, this is
a function of migraines.

00:07:19.792 --> 00:07:22.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a function of
altered states of consciousness

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.220 align:middle line:90%
to feel that way.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Well, I think it's
a question of labeling.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.500 align:middle line:84%
We label these things as
being aberrant or dangerous or

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.120 align:middle line:84%
difficult states
of consciousness,

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.661 align:middle line:84%
whereas in fact all it is is
the brain is actually accessing,

00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:39.320 align:middle line:84%
or consciousness is accessing,
a broader spectrum of reality

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.850 align:middle line:90%
than we normally do.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
comes up a lot for him,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.060 align:middle line:84%
because he was going
through these-- let's just

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.550 align:middle line:84%
say he was experiencing
altered states of reality

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:84%
from a very young age-- and
his mother was dragging him

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.800 align:middle line:84%
to the doctor and the
psychiatrist constantly.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.860 align:middle line:90%
And he was put on what?

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.040 align:middle line:90%
Amphetamines?

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.020 align:middle line:90%
By the age of nine?

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: They were
drugging him up.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.470 align:middle line:84%
He stated many times
that he had been

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:90%
an undiagnosed schizophrenic.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Whatever an undiagnosed
schizophrenic is I'm

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.980 align:middle line:90%
not quite sure.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.920 align:middle line:84%
But effectively he said
that they were much

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.310 align:middle line:84%
thinking about what his
issues or problems were.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, in those days one
had to label things

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and one had to have a category
of where somebody was.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.907 align:middle line:84%
Whereas Phil, to me, was just
an extremely deep thinker,

00:08:21.907 --> 00:08:23.490 align:middle line:84%
and they just couldn't
deal with that.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.250 align:middle line:84%
He was perceiving
things and thinking

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.500 align:middle line:84%
about things in a much deeper
way than his peer group were.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And so for him,
there was escape.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.950 align:middle line:84%
He started writing
at a very early age.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.909 align:middle line:84%
And for him, he
went into sci-fi,

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:39.370 align:middle line:84%
but he went into really
deep cultural themes

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:44.940 align:middle line:84%
as his life went on as well,
themes that were prescient,

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.260 align:middle line:84%
that ended up being very
similar to the reality

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.730 align:middle line:90%
that we're experiencing today.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.680 align:middle line:84%
He was experiencing these 50,
60 years in advance, actually.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Extremely so.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:84%
It is quite amazing when
you look back at the things

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.560 align:middle line:84%
that Phil predicted
in his novels that

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.810 align:middle line:90%
have come to pass now.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:90%
There's a whole list of them.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.310 align:middle line:90%
We could go on and on.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm going
to prompt you on some,

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.157 align:middle line:84%
but I would like you
bring up any that you

00:09:09.157 --> 00:09:10.490 align:middle line:90%
feel are relevant in the moment.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Well, things
like retinal displays,

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.848 align:middle line:84%
the way in which
you could actually

00:09:13.848 --> 00:09:16.175 align:middle line:84%
recognize somebody's interests
from actually scanning

00:09:16.175 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:90%
them, scanning their face.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.310 align:middle line:84%
My favorite one is of
doors that actually

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.202 align:middle line:84%
open when you ask them
to in one of his novels.

00:09:25.202 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Where the door-- I think it's
"Ubik" where the door refuses

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.794 align:middle line:84%
to open unless it gives
him some-- gives him money.

00:09:30.794 --> 00:09:33.210 align:middle line:84%
But on top of that, just the
breakdown of society as well,

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.540 align:middle line:84%
the way in society--
the way in which,

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:84%
particularly in the novel
"Radio Free Albemuth,"

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:84%
he very much conveys a society
that has developed surveillance

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.940 align:middle line:84%
in massive levels
because there's

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.670 align:middle line:84%
supposedly an enemy
somewhere and we

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.205 align:middle line:84%
have to keep control
of our population.

00:09:52.205 --> 00:09:54.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's a surreptitious
way of actually controlling

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.780 align:middle line:90%
individual thought.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.040 align:middle line:84%
He was always
hyper-aware of this.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.090 align:middle line:90%
He was a very political person.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.331 align:middle line:90%
But political with a small p.

00:10:02.331 --> 00:10:04.330 align:middle line:84%
One couldn't say he was
left-wing or right-wing.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.030 align:middle line:84%
He was very much
just Philip K. Dick

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:90%
in the way he saw the world.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.470 align:middle line:84%
But he did dabble with
left-wing politics

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.280 align:middle line:84%
when he was involved
with his first wife.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and we'll get
to that in just a little bit.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Life started taking
on a different kind

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.630 align:middle line:90%
of flavor for him at that time.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.409 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting,
because it's not

00:10:20.409 --> 00:10:22.200 align:middle line:84%
as though he was the
first and only author.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we think of or
Orwell, for example.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.334 align:middle line:84%
He also talked about
a surveilled society.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:27.750 align:middle line:84%
But in the case
of Orwell, we also

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:84%
know that he was
an insider and had

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.830 align:middle line:84%
knowledge of what the
agenda was going to be.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And do you feel that
Phillip did not have that?

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.300 align:middle line:84%
It was all within his own
being that he was essentially

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.972 align:middle line:84%
scanning and receiving
this future information.

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Correct.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I think with Phil, the issue
was that because of the way

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.380 align:middle line:84%
his brain was
functioning, and we

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.120 align:middle line:84%
can touch on that a
little bit later on,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.180 align:middle line:84%
he was seeming to
access information

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:54.600 align:middle line:84%
from what Ervin Laszlo, the
Hungarian-American writer,

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.330 align:middle line:84%
would call the Akashic
field or the Akashic record,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
as if he was taking information
from somewhere else.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And in my book, I have
a series of examples

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.690 align:middle line:84%
of how it can be argued that
Phil's novels themselves

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.287 align:middle line:84%
were actually created by
events in his own future.

00:11:11.287 --> 00:11:13.620 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, he would
have an event in the future,

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and the information
would be in some way what

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.650 align:middle line:84%
he called orthogonal
time, could actually

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.030 align:middle line:84%
be moved backwards in
time to actually seed

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.730 align:middle line:90%
his own ideas and his own past.

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.689 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's talk
about orthogonal time.

00:11:24.689 --> 00:11:26.521 align:middle line:84%
I was going to bring
that up a little later,

00:11:26.521 --> 00:11:28.250 align:middle line:84%
but we'll go back
into his life and kind

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.247 align:middle line:84%
of chronologically
work through it.

00:11:30.247 --> 00:11:31.330 align:middle line:90%
But this such a big theme.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.820 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you explain this now?

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: OK.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Orthogonal time was Phil's idea.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:84%
He discusses it in great
detail in his "Exegesis,"

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.970 align:middle line:84%
which is a series of thousands
and thousands of pages

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:84%
of handwritten and
type-written manuscripts

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:49.740 align:middle line:84%
that he wrote after his 2-3-74
experiences-- his theophany,

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.320 align:middle line:90%
as he termed it.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And in this he has sections on
what he calls orthogonal time.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.895 align:middle line:84%
Now, he argues what
orthogonal time is

00:11:56.895 --> 00:12:00.900 align:middle line:84%
is that time runs from the past,
becomes the pre-- time runs

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.480 align:middle line:84%
from the future, comes
and becomes the present,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and then rolls into the
past like a river flowing.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Phil argued that at
any point in time

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.100 align:middle line:84%
there is a time flow
which runs at right angles

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.420 align:middle line:90%
to the present moment.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And he called that
orthogonal time.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Now again, it astounds me that
Phil came up with this concept

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.245 align:middle line:84%
when he was-- of all the
writers he was interested in,

00:12:23.245 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle line:84%
the one writer that came
up with this concept

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.410 align:middle line:84%
was a Russian philosopher
called Peter Ouspensky.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.200 align:middle line:84%
But Phil never in
any of his writings

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:90%
ever references Ouspensky.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So he came up with a very
similar idea to Ouspensky.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And his argument was
that time is just a now.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a present now.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And again, he wrote
about a concept

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:84%
that I now know as
the linseria, which

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.960 align:middle line:84%
is the long body, the
idea that we-- in time,

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.400 align:middle line:84%
we're effectively all
the same individual.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.256 align:middle line:84%
So from the moment of our birth
to the moment of our death--

00:12:56.256 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle line:84%
I'll use the example if you took
a time-lapsed photograph of us

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.810 align:middle line:84%
walking around this room, we
wouldn't be a single figure.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.622 align:middle line:84%
We'd be a blur and
an extended figure.

00:13:04.622 --> 00:13:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you took a time-lapsed
photograph of somebody

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.735 align:middle line:84%
over 70 years, they'd start as
a very, very small little thing,

00:13:09.735 --> 00:13:11.360 align:middle line:84%
worm-like thing, get
bigger and bigger,

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and then start to shrink
again and disappear again.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:84%
This was very much Phil's
philosophy, as well,

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:21.470 align:middle line:84%
in that any time, we are just
a snapshot, a cut-through,

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:84%
what Hermann Minkowski
would call block time.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.550 align:middle line:90%
We're a block-time instant.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.786 align:middle line:84%
And the real self is all of
these selves, and that is us.

00:13:29.786 --> 00:13:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So functionally
speaking, orthogonal time

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.972 align:middle line:84%
is simply that
cut-through to the now.

00:13:33.972 --> 00:13:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Correct,

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's just now.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.138 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: It's the cut-through
to the now from outside

00:13:37.138 --> 00:13:39.680 align:middle line:84%
of three-dimensional spacetime
or four-dimensional spacetime.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.221 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
for sharing that,

00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:42.870 align:middle line:84%
because he was
living in that zone.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: He was.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lot.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.347 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to slide
that cut-through to any point

00:13:47.347 --> 00:13:49.180 align:middle line:84%
where he was in the
now, whether it appeared

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.929 align:middle line:84%
to be the future
or whatnot, right?

00:13:50.929 --> 00:13:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Yes.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's go
back to his younger life.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Now, he's on amphetamines.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.680 align:middle line:90%
He's been diagnosed.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.060 align:middle line:84%
He's now becoming
really quite nervous

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.900 align:middle line:84%
at almost everything
at life-- in life.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.920 align:middle line:90%
His dad's gone.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And now, he's a writer
by the age of nine.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.556 align:middle line:84%
By 13, his first novel
is published, right?

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Well, it was
published a little bit later,

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.772 align:middle line:84%
but he'd actually been
writing since then.

00:14:12.772 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I think he was little
bit older than that

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.480 align:middle line:84%
when his first
novel was published.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "Return to
Lilluput"-- when was that?

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: "Return to Lilliput"
was his book-- first story

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:19.610 align:middle line:90%
he wrote.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And technically,
yes, I think it was

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.380 align:middle line:90%
published in his own magazine.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.380 align:middle line:84%
He had his own-- he
had-- Twice in his life

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.750 align:middle line:90%
he worked on his own magazines.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What were
these young themes

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.190 align:middle line:90%
about when he was a kid still?

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:31.648 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Well,
"Return to Lill-- he

00:14:31.648 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:84%
was fascinated by the
Jules Verne and Dean Swift

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:90%
and writers like that.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So he was writing as
a young individual.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.410 align:middle line:84%
But "Return to Lilliput"
always fascinated me

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.920 align:middle line:84%
because I was intrigued as to
what exactly the storyline was.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think I'm
right in saying even

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Phil himself wasn't 100%
sure what he remembered it.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:84%
But he argued it was probably
Gulliver going back many years

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.990 align:middle line:84%
later to see how the
society had developed.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.220 align:middle line:84%
But as he got older, he
started to write more and more.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think he
became very friendly

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:90%
with a guy called Tony Boucher.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.660 align:middle line:10%
And Tony Boucher was a
science fiction writer.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And Tony very much helped
him hone his skills.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He also took on a
fatherly role, as I understand.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Very much so.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For the
father that had

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.330 align:middle line:90%
been missing all those years.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Totally.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He really
loved this man,

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.058 align:middle line:84%
and this man supported him
wholeheartedly, it sounds.

00:15:21.058 --> 00:15:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: He was devastated
when Tony Boucher died,

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:90%
very comparatively young.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.520 align:middle line:90%
And he lost him there.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's an interesting aside
that Phil's mother was also

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:31.820 align:middle line:90%
doing writing lessons.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.647 align:middle line:84%
And Tony Boucher was
her teacher as well.

00:15:33.647 --> 00:15:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: He was doing local
lessons and Phil came along.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.189 align:middle line:84%
But then Phil started to
write his short stories,

00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:42.230 align:middle line:84%
because there seemed to
be the idea that probably

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.600 align:middle line:84%
short stories was the
way to go forward.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think I'm right
in saying that his first

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.110 align:middle line:84%
published short story, I
think, was "Here Lies the Wub,"

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.817 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:15:49.817 --> 00:15:50.400 align:middle line:90%
No, it wasn't.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.420 align:middle line:90%
It was the dog.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was
going to say, yes,

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.824 align:middle line:84%
that's the one I wanted
to ask you about.

00:15:54.824 --> 00:15:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: "Roog."

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Roog."

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.080 align:middle line:90%
That's where we're going.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:04.320 align:middle line:84%
I found it kind of heartrending,
the nature of that story,

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.420 align:middle line:84%
because I thought it
really gives insight

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.900 align:middle line:84%
into the sensitivity of this
man to look at this struggle

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.500 align:middle line:90%
through the eyes of a dog.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Can you please share the
plot of "Roog" with us?

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: It's very much-- it's
from the viewpoint of a dog who

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:22.430 align:middle line:84%
is aware of the fact
that there are aliens.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And the aliens are
actually stalking mankind.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:31.170 align:middle line:84%
But the human beings around
him don't realize the fact.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So he tries to give them a
warning by barking and saying,

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.840 align:middle line:90%
roog, roog.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And whenever aliens are
around, they say roog.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And you see-- it's almost like
the cartoons of that period,

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:46.020 align:middle line:84%
where you saw animals and human
beings would be large and big,

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and they'd be looking down
at the animals in some way,

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.279 align:middle line:84%
as if they were kind of
periphery to the storyline.

00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And of course with the
dog, it's probably, again,

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.310 align:middle line:84%
symptomatic of Phil's
worldview, the inability

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.920 align:middle line:84%
to communicate
important information

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.410 align:middle line:84%
that he was desperately wanting
to get across, as the dog was,

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:84%
which was of great
importance and danger.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think this says a great
deal about Phil at the time.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:08.740 align:middle line:90%
Again--

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Little
bit of noise here--

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.520 align:middle line:90%
we're in a studio in London.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.780 align:middle line:84%
We have alarms going off and
things banging and clanging,

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.560 align:middle line:90%
but we'll just continue on.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Absolutely.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.690 align:middle line:84%
But the way in which Phil
wrote that story, I think,

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.970 align:middle line:84%
was very much
symptomatic of a lot

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:84%
of the things that carried on
throughout his life, the idea

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:29.830 align:middle line:84%
of the outsider, the idea of
the little man being controlled

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.720 align:middle line:90%
by much bigger events.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.770 align:middle line:84%
His heroes are always
the journeyman.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.879 align:middle line:84%
And he's always-- he
always has difficulties

00:17:36.879 --> 00:17:38.920 align:middle line:84%
with the-- they used to
call it the nagging wife,

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.130 align:middle line:84%
or the haradin, that used to
be the negativity in his life

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.000 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.235 align:middle line:84%
And he was also more
done-by than the doer

00:17:46.235 --> 00:17:47.166 align:middle line:90%
in many, many ways.

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting, that
perception of dogs in this way,

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.700 align:middle line:84%
because I have to say,
even in real life,

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:84%
I've always found
that to be true.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.430 align:middle line:84%
The dogs, my dogs, will
always be seeing things

00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:59.380 align:middle line:90%
that we're not seeing.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And they'll stand
specifically, stare up,

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and talk or growl or
bark at things in space.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I've come to respect
the fact that they're

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:90%
seeing what we are not.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to
inform us, but we're usually

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:90%
not listening.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:84%
You think, what's that
silly dog going on about?

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.515 align:middle line:84%
But that was his
observation at a young age.

00:18:16.515 --> 00:18:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: That was.

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:90%
What is that dog doing?

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.260 align:middle line:90%
Why is that dog doing that?

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that was
perceptive to the work

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:25.710 align:middle line:84%
of researchers such as Rupert
Sheldrake and how a dog knows

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:26.210 align:middle line:90%
that it's--

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
owner's coming home.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: The
owner's coming home.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And they do.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.850 align:middle line:84%
I just had a friend who was
staying at my house say,

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:31.967 align:middle line:90%
it's so funny.

00:18:31.967 --> 00:18:33.550 align:middle line:84%
You were coming home
from the airport,

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and about an hour before you
came home, they sat there,

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and they just waited at
the door, watching it.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:38.959 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:18:38.959 --> 00:18:39.500 align:middle line:90%
It's so true.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.520 align:middle line:84%
We see this observationally,
but he proved it

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.690 align:middle line:90%
more scientifically.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Well, I suppose
it's the argument here.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%
We could also apply the
orthogonal time in some way.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's
a very good point.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.421 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Can dogs
perceive outside of time?

00:18:49.421 --> 00:18:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And they see echoes
of the future,

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.567 align:middle line:84%
and they see their owner coming
home before they come home.

00:18:53.567 --> 00:18:54.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Now, again,
various writers

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.520 align:middle line:84%
such as a Ouspensky, again
going about Ousepensky--

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.420 align:middle line:84%
but the idea that we can
perceive things outside of time

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.920 align:middle line:84%
in some way or
other and that time

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.745 align:middle line:84%
can smear out both in the
future and in the past.

00:19:09.745 --> 00:19:11.245 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
there's been research

00:19:11.245 --> 00:19:15.320 align:middle line:84%
done on this in neurology, where
we now know that perception can

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.170 align:middle line:84%
lie up to eight seconds
behind what is actually

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.080 align:middle line:90%
happening in the outside world.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:22.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's now go into his life.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.580 align:middle line:84%
As he gets a little older
now, he marries young.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.260 align:middle line:90%
He's in Berkeley, OK?

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is quite a hotbed of
liberal activism at the time.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And he is now under review
because of his association,

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:38.790 align:middle line:84%
through his wife, with
the Communist party.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And this-- is this
the first time

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:45.140 align:middle line:84%
in which his life starts
taking on a political sense,

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:45.740 align:middle line:90%
so to speak?

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: I would say yes.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I would think that his
second wife, Cleo--

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:51.230 align:middle line:84%
because he had a very,
very short marriage when

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.180 align:middle line:90%
he was younger.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.770 align:middle line:84%
But his second wife, Cleo, was
it was a very political lady.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.505 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways, I think she
was absolutely right for Phil

00:19:58.505 --> 00:20:00.960 align:middle line:84%
at that stage in his
life in the sense

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.020 align:middle line:84%
that she politicized
him with a small piece.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.940 align:middle line:84%
She made him aware
of social concerns.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Berkley at that time,
as has always been the case,

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:11.940 align:middle line:84%
has always been a hotbed
of radical thinking.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.394 align:middle line:90%
And Phil became part of that.

00:20:13.394 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:84%
But I think one
of the things that

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.850 align:middle line:84%
is typical of Phil and Phil's
personality and his closeness

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.780 align:middle line:84%
to people-- although some would
argue that he had difficulty

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.770 align:middle line:84%
and there were elements of
autism in his personality,

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:27.350 align:middle line:84%
but effectively, the
Smith and Jones, I think,

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.785 align:middle line:84%
were the two characters
that Cleo and Phil called

00:20:29.785 --> 00:20:31.830 align:middle line:84%
the agents that used
to watch over them.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And he actually convinced one of
them to teach him how to drive.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:38.070 align:middle line:84%
So one of these spooks
taught Phil how to drive.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.950 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually see
this curious dynamic

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:46.270 align:middle line:84%
of how Phil could be
incredibly personable.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.344 align:middle line:84%
And people genuinely
liked him and genuinely--

00:20:48.344 --> 00:20:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also embraced
the circumstance, saying, hey,

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle line:90%
this is what it is.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I'll use
this to my advantage.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.464 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: I'll use
this to my advantage.

00:20:54.464 --> 00:20:58.134 align:middle line:84%
And so he was followed,
his life was followed,

00:20:58.134 --> 00:20:59.550 align:middle line:84%
his work was
followed very closely

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.925 align:middle line:90%
by the intelligence communities.

00:21:00.925 --> 00:21:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Oh, totally.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And he became
convinced that he was

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.310 align:middle line:90%
being followed all the time.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And as you probably
know, in November 1971,

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I think it was, there was an
incident in his apartment.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:23.536 align:middle line:84%
And when he came home,
his safe had been blown up

00:21:23.536 --> 00:21:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and everything else and
his papers had been stolen.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, not
just broken into.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.719 align:middle line:84%
Someone didn't just
try to jerry-rig it.

00:21:29.719 --> 00:21:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: They blew it up.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.843 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They blew it up.

00:21:31.843 --> 00:21:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So they felt he was a
person of extreme interest.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.247 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Yeah, he felt
that he was being watched.

00:21:37.247 --> 00:21:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And all through his
life, he had this belief

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:39.930 align:middle line:90%
he was been watched.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.596 align:middle line:84%
In the later stages
in life, he believed

00:21:41.596 --> 00:21:43.440 align:middle line:90%
that it was even more strange.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And he felt that it was possibly
to do with even aliens, which

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:48.649 align:middle line:84%
is an intriguing idea, which
I touch on in the book.

00:21:48.649 --> 00:21:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're
comfortable with this idea.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.481 align:middle line:84%
Our audience is
comfortable with this idea.

00:21:52.481 --> 00:21:53.920 align:middle line:84%
You can go on as
much as you like.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: OK, because
Phil very much--

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.460 align:middle line:84%
he was interviewed
by Brad Steiger.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.312 align:middle line:84%
And he was interviewed by Brad
on two or three occasions,

00:22:03.312 --> 00:22:05.520 align:middle line:84%
and in fact Brad was due to
actually meet up with him

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.020 align:middle line:90%
just before he died.

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.667 align:middle line:84%
And Phil came to the
conclusion he was a starseed.

00:22:09.667 --> 00:22:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And as you know,
Phil had this concept

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.950 align:middle line:84%
called the plasmate and
the homoplasmate, the idea

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:17.020 align:middle line:84%
that we are some
form of embodied DNA

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.470 align:middle line:90%
and we are from somewhere else.

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And Phil argued that he
felt very, very strongly

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.840 align:middle line:84%
that at some stage in his
past he had been abducted

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.410 align:middle line:84%
or he had been
manipulated in some way.

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, Tessa,
his fifth wife,

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.500 align:middle line:84%
also argues the
same kind of thing.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And she says that she felt
that Phil and her were brought

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.660 align:middle line:84%
together because
of incidents that

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.190 align:middle line:84%
happened in their childhood
where they believed that they

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:44.890 align:middle line:84%
had actually been part of some
kind of program or something.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:47.062 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can find no
particular evidence of that,

00:22:47.062 --> 00:22:49.520 align:middle line:84%
but just because I can't find
evidence of that doesn't mean

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.100 align:middle line:90%
it didn't happen.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, that's right.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:52.720 align:middle line:84%
It would be very personal
and experiential.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing-- I've interviewed

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:84%
quite a few people
who have claimed

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.400 align:middle line:84%
to have had this
experience and there's

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:84%
certain interesting evidence
in their background,

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and the one thing they all
seem to share in common

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:07.555 align:middle line:84%
is that they have an upgraded
hardware system of sorts.

00:23:07.555 --> 00:23:08.430 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:09.263 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:09.263 --> 00:23:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They do have
expanded perception natively.

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Many, many of them have
expanded perception.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Many of them have
this same attribute

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.240 align:middle line:84%
that they've been able to
go into a future timeline,

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:26.660 align:middle line:84%
for example, or say that they
were shown future events,

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.700 align:middle line:90%
either way.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying it's all
down to alien interface,

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:33.730 align:middle line:84%
but it's certainly
conceivable that when

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:37.780 align:middle line:84%
he was very, very young, as
the kind of being that he was,

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.430 align:middle line:84%
that he may have had this
experience that gave him access

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:41.752 align:middle line:90%
to more than the rest of us.

00:23:41.752 --> 00:23:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Well, it
would explain-- I mean,

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:47.262 align:middle line:84%
during his 2-3-74 experiences
where he had a series

00:23:47.262 --> 00:23:48.970 align:middle line:84%
of extraordinary
experiences take place--

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:50.386 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you
talk about that?

00:23:50.386 --> 00:23:53.700 align:middle line:10%
>>PEAKE: Yeah,
2-3-74 is what Phil

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:58.790 align:middle line:10%
used to call the instance
of February and March 1974.

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:02.310 align:middle line:10%
And during that period,
he had been in great pain

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:04.460 align:middle line:10%
with an impacted wisdom tooth.

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And he'd been
given various drugs

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:84%
to deal with this wisdom
tooth and such like.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But one day, he was in such
pain that they sent out

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.454 align:middle line:84%
for some drugs,
painkillers, for him.

00:24:17.454 --> 00:24:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And when he opened
the door, there

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:21.640 align:middle line:84%
was a young woman at the
door wearing a pendant.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of the fish
symbols that Christians use.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And Phil claimed that as
he looked at the pendant,

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.845 align:middle line:84%
a pink light flashed out and
went into, he later was to say,

00:24:30.845 --> 00:24:33.540 align:middle line:84%
his pineal gland and
opened up his mind.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.729 align:middle line:84%
Now, in my book-- I
won't ruin my book--

00:24:35.729 --> 00:24:37.645 align:middle line:84%
but I think there are
alternative explanations

00:24:37.645 --> 00:24:40.760 align:middle line:84%
for that which are slightly more
mundane but nevertheless still

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.150 align:middle line:84%
interesting as to what
stimulated subsequently

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:44.470 align:middle line:90%
what took place.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:48.980 align:middle line:84%
But effectively he argued
that he started to see things

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and perceive things that he
hadn't been aware of before.

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:55.290 align:middle line:84%
He saw the-- he became
profoundly gnostic in the sense

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.130 align:middle line:84%
he argued that what
we're living in now

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:84%
is what he called a
black iron prison.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:04.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a facsimile universe
created by the Archons,

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.330 align:middle line:84%
for want of a better
term, to fool us

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and to keep us away from
the real reality, what

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.430 align:middle line:90%
he called a palm-tree garden.

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:12.370 align:middle line:84%
He also argued that
time had stopped

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.670 align:middle line:84%
in-- he flipped the
dates, but normally 70 AD,

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.610 align:middle line:84%
which was the fall of
the temple and the Romans

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:21.920 align:middle line:90%
and the Roman war with the Jews.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And he argued that
time had stopped then,

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:25.179 align:middle line:90%
and we were all trapped.

00:25:25.179 --> 00:25:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I was going
to ask you about that.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Go on about that a
bit, because it really

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.460 align:middle line:90%
was fundamental to his thinking.

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.126 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: It was.

00:25:31.126 --> 00:25:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And he started to then believed
that he was the incarnation

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.320 align:middle line:84%
or he was being communicated
with by somebody

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.190 align:middle line:90%
from that period of time.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:42.799 align:middle line:84%
Now, he then from this
started to realize

00:25:42.799 --> 00:25:44.840 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
else manifesting in him.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.256 align:middle line:84%
There was something else that
was downloading information,

00:25:47.256 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:84%
giving him information, which
he termed VALIS, Vast, Active

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Learning Information System,
which he then came to believe

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.979 align:middle line:84%
was some form of satellite, a
geostationary satellite that

00:25:58.979 --> 00:26:01.395 align:middle line:84%
was sitting out in space that
was beaming down information

00:26:01.395 --> 00:26:03.080 align:middle line:90%
to him.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.470 align:middle line:84%
From there, he then decided
it was the Russians that

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.030 align:middle line:84%
were actually
beaming information

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:10.330 align:middle line:84%
from a place somewhere
in the Soviet Union.

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:14.350 align:middle line:84%
He had what he called his
Kandinsky visions, which

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:18.180 align:middle line:84%
were an eight-hour period where
he saw just pictures, paintings

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.320 align:middle line:90%
flashed in front of his face.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And they all seemed to be very
similar to the Russian abstract

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.476 align:middle line:84%
expressionist Wassily Kandinsky
or various other paintings.

00:26:27.476 --> 00:26:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And he checked out, and he found
that a lot of the paintings he

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:84%
thought he saw were
actually in the Hermitage

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:33.835 align:middle line:90%
in Saint Petersburg.

00:26:33.835 --> 00:26:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And he had come
to the conclusion

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:37.680 align:middle line:90%
they were manipulating his mind.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.880 align:middle line:10%
So what he felt was that in
some way or other, a part of him

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:47.450 align:middle line:10%
had been opened up that
was communicating with him.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:49.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm very intrigued by
this, because I believe

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.549 align:middle line:84%
this particular manifestation
of whatever it was

00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:54.590 align:middle line:84%
was his own higher self,
and he was communicating

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:59.560 align:middle line:84%
with a part of himself that
knew everything about his life.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, in my book I cite
some curious examples of-- He

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.560 align:middle line:84%
did an interview
in the 1970s where

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:84%
he described that he had
recently or comparatively

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.250 align:middle line:84%
recently been having
dreams of being back

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:18.720 align:middle line:90%
in his house in the early 1950s.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And he then recalled in the
house in the early 1950s

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:24.930 align:middle line:84%
that he once--
two or three times

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:28.181 align:middle line:84%
woke up and saw a man standing
at the end of the bed.

00:27:28.181 --> 00:27:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And he believed the man
standing at the end of the bed

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:33.720 align:middle line:84%
was a manifestation of
himself in the future.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.430 align:middle line:84%
But if you take his
orthogonal time hypothesis,

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:38.060 align:middle line:90%
this is perfectly reasonable.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:84%
In other words, in
the nether world,

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:42.890 align:middle line:84%
which is our subconscious,
time doesn't exist.

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Therefore we're all
part of our own narrative.

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And if there is part of us
that's already experienced

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:53.160 align:middle line:84%
this life, that person's
narrative is our whole life.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.070 align:middle line:84%
We are experiencing
it in linear time,

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:84%
but you could use the argument
of it's like a computer game.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's the
computer game player,

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.135 align:middle line:84%
who has lived the
life many times,

00:28:02.135 --> 00:28:03.990 align:middle line:84%
and there's the
perception, in which case

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:07.220 align:middle line:84%
that would explain his
backward ability to feed back

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.470 align:middle line:90%
plot lines from his own future.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And he had the, some
would say, disadvantage

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:14.190 align:middle line:84%
of having also
seen his own death

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:middle line:84%
along the way and some
other things as well.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Oh, absolutely.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:19.554 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I mean, this was
really quite personal for him.

00:28:19.554 --> 00:28:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Going back to VALIS, the notion
of the protagonist-- Horselover

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Fat, which is his own
name-- it's his own name,

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:32.330 align:middle line:84%
but also the notion of
protagonists in general,

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:36.620 align:middle line:84%
he didn't seem to feel that
the lone protagonist was part

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.545 align:middle line:84%
of reality-- that was a
reality, that everything

00:28:39.545 --> 00:28:42.150 align:middle line:84%
is so interconnected,
you couldn't even

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:44.950 align:middle line:84%
say there's a lone protagonist,
although he may have created

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.390 align:middle line:84%
one such in his
plots, for example.

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: That's the wonderful
thing about the novel "VALIS"

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and the creation
of Horselover Fat.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Because in the novel, it's
narrated by a science fiction

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.820 align:middle line:90%
writer called Phil Dick.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And Phil Dick discusses
in his narrative

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.740 align:middle line:84%
about this friend of
his, Horselover Fat,

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.560 align:middle line:90%
who's going absolutely crazy.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And the Phil Dick
character is very much

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:12.380 align:middle line:84%
his rational self analyzing his
own behaviors during 2-3-74,

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.380 align:middle line:84%
because effectively, a
lot of the instances that

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.420 align:middle line:84%
are described in 2-3-74
are actually incorporated

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.540 align:middle line:84%
into the plot in
"VALIS" and indeed

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:23.690 align:middle line:84%
are incorporated into the
plots of "Radio Free Albemuth"

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:24.550 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:30.120 align:middle line:84%
So he has this punning
title of Horselover Fat,

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.000 align:middle line:84%
and the cleverness
of it-- because Phil

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.800 align:middle line:84%
was quite a linguist-- and
the Horselover is Philippos

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:41.130 align:middle line:84%
in Greek and in fact is--
Dick is German for fat.

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:43.410 align:middle line:84%
So effectively he
has his own pun.

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, he was very-- he confused
people in terms of this.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Because many people said, did he
actually deliberately do that?

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.600 align:middle line:84%
He wrote to Usrula Le
Guin, one of his friends,

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.495 align:middle line:84%
and he said, people
continually say

00:29:55.495 --> 00:29:58.030 align:middle line:84%
that Horselover Fat is supposed
to be me, and it's not.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:29:59.530 align:middle line:90%
But it self-evidently was.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:00.445 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:00.445 --> 00:30:01.579 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: And in the novel--

00:30:01.579 --> 00:30:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: An aspect of himself.

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: It was an
aspect of himself.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, he took this theme further
in many of his other novels

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.830 align:middle line:84%
where you have
personalities breaking down.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.050 align:middle line:84%
You have personalities
fractionalizing

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:18.500 align:middle line:90%
into different personalities.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which was his reality.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Yeah, which
was his reality.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and also let's get

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.110 align:middle line:84%
into the fact-- he did a lot of
psychedelics and such as well,

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.610 align:middle line:90%
didn't he?

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Well, this is one of
the stories that goes round

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:30.040 align:middle line:84%
that Phil did LSD
quite regularly.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.160 align:middle line:84%
As far as my
research goes, I can

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.274 align:middle line:84%
find he did LSD probably
about three or four times.

00:30:35.274 --> 00:30:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was it.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:37.065 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: That was it.

00:30:37.065 --> 00:30:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what were
the experiences that he--

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: They were profound.

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:45.150 align:middle line:84%
He had one experience where
he-- again, it's interesting.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:48.700 align:middle line:84%
He claimed he started
speaking in Latin and he was--

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was remembering--

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:52.790 align:middle line:84%
He was was going back into
that Roman timeline that

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:54.730 align:middle line:84%
was so important to
him, though, right?

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:55.438 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Correct.

00:30:55.438 --> 00:30:57.020 align:middle line:84%
He would argue that
he was actually

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:01.450 align:middle line:84%
manifesting the same self within
the personality of an earlier

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:04.020 align:middle line:84%
version of himself, a
recincarnated part of himself

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:07.340 align:middle line:84%
or an earlier part, and that
he was perceiving reality

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.590 align:middle line:90%
from that viewpoint.

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:11.470 align:middle line:84%
But of course, again, if
you take Phil's worldview

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:13.510 align:middle line:84%
that reality is
not what it seems,

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:17.570 align:middle line:84%
it's not at all surprising
that time could play around

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:19.720 align:middle line:84%
with itself in that
way within his mind.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
just kind of hop back

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:26.180 align:middle line:84%
for a sec on that theme
and drag it forward,

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:30.420 align:middle line:84%
the notion of that
frozen point in history,

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.700 align:middle line:84%
of the Roman times that he
was relating so strongly to,

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and the overlay of what
is occurring today.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Yes, it's,
again, the idea

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.690 align:middle line:84%
that what we see today
is just a manifestation,

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:46.300 align:middle line:84%
a grounded manifestation
within this reality,

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:52.870 align:middle line:84%
of the creators of the false
reality, and that whatever we

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:55.550 align:middle line:84%
see, whatever we see
problems and torments

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and difficulties
in the world, it's

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.142 align:middle line:84%
very much the manipulators
of reality that are actually

00:32:00.142 --> 00:32:01.600 align:middle line:84%
doing this, that
are playing around

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.760 align:middle line:90%
with it in one way or another.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
know now-- I mean,

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm not one for
conspiracy theory,

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.680 align:middle line:84%
but if you do look into the
writings of Philip K. Dick

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the writings
of a lot of theorists

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.525 align:middle line:84%
in this field, there does
seem to be extreme parallels.

00:32:13.525 --> 00:32:15.122 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, perfect overlay.

00:32:15.122 --> 00:32:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: I mean, Phil
was very, very interested

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:22.380 align:middle line:84%
in the idea of DNA manipulating
us in some way or other,

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.429 align:middle line:84%
that we have DNA memories
within ourselves.

00:32:25.429 --> 00:32:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there
are many writers

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:28.970 align:middle line:84%
writing about this
thing now as well.

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go
back into the '50s.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Really, a lot of his
musings of this kind

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:41.330 align:middle line:84%
of about a very highly
manipulated society at large

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:43.900 align:middle line:84%
were born out of
the '50s, right?

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And now, what I'm
wondering about

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:50.420 align:middle line:84%
that-- it's post World
War II, most of the world

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.500 align:middle line:84%
has suffered a
great deal, and you

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:57.010 align:middle line:84%
could say PTSD is kind of
a global state of affairs.

00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And we know, even through
the subject of hypnosis

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.820 align:middle line:84%
and studying that, that any time
you have a fractured psyche,

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:09.390 align:middle line:84%
you have trauma, then you have
a highly programmable society

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:10.750 align:middle line:90%
or individual.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And so can you
talk about what he

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:15.270 align:middle line:84%
was perceiving that
happened to us in the '50s?

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just setting
that as some background.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.559 align:middle line:84%
We were receptive
as a civilization.

00:33:19.559 --> 00:33:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Well, effectively, we'd
had the trauma of the Second

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:27.570 align:middle line:84%
World War, and we then had the
specter of nuclear weapons.

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:30.870 align:middle line:84%
We then had the
Cold War developing.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:34.820 align:middle line:10%
We had the Berlin blockade
that we all had to deal with.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And that generation, or
people in that decade,

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:40.870 align:middle line:84%
were continually
believing that the bomb

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:43.030 align:middle line:90%
was going to drop soon.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:47.480 align:middle line:84%
We then had the
McCarthy witch trials.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.960 align:middle line:84%
We had the witch hunts in
Hollywood of individuals

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:54.080 align:middle line:84%
who were considered
un-American in terms of this.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And we know Phil failed,
partially failed,

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.030 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of those
things at the time.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.210 align:middle line:90%
He was aware of these issues.

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Phil also carried on
this kind of mental state

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.250 align:middle line:84%
into the late
1960s, early 1970s,

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:09.400 align:middle line:84%
with his innate
dislike of Nixon.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
going to go there next.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:16.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, before we go to Nixon and
Ferris Farnsworth and all that.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:20.130 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Let's
move on now to what

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:23.409 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about as his
innate dislike of Richard

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Milhous Nixon, who was
also part of the scaring

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:29.457 align:middle line:84%
up of the Communists in
this country as well.

00:34:29.457 --> 00:34:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Absolutely.

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:32.280 align:middle line:84%
There are many
parallels, I think,

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.290 align:middle line:84%
between the 1950s
and the era of Nixon.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Phil
living in California

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:41.969 align:middle line:84%
was very much aware of Nixon as
a Californian and Linda Yorba,

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:45.046 align:middle line:84%
I think, where Nixon
was brought up.

00:34:45.046 --> 00:34:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was it Loma
Linda, I believe.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Loma Linda, yes, yes.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And so effectively,
he knew that Nixon

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.080 align:middle line:84%
was comparatively
local to him as well.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.639 align:middle line:84%
But he had this kind of
curious, ambivalent relationship

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:57.449 align:middle line:84%
with Nixon, because
in his letters,

00:34:57.449 --> 00:34:59.740 align:middle line:84%
there are a series of letters
that-- well, at least one

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.115 align:middle line:84%
or two that I'm aware of, that
he actually wrote to Nixon

00:35:02.115 --> 00:35:03.800 align:middle line:90%
congratulating him.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.942 align:middle line:84%
So there was this kind
of curious approach

00:35:05.942 --> 00:35:06.900 align:middle line:90%
that he took to people.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.159 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very curious
considering his writings.

00:35:09.159 --> 00:35:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Very typical
of Phil in many ways.

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:13.220 align:middle line:90%
Now, was he trying to be ironic?

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Was he playing
around with things?

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.425 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to say
from just a bald letter.

00:35:18.425 --> 00:35:19.925 align:middle line:84%
But he did definitely
write a letter

00:35:19.925 --> 00:35:22.070 align:middle line:90%
to Nixon congratulating him.

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:25.440 align:middle line:84%
But I think in many ways
the 19-- at that time

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.160 align:middle line:84%
there was this
same kind of fear.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.970 align:middle line:84%
The Vietnam War was going
terribly, terribly wrong.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:33.040 align:middle line:84%
The world was looking
again a dangerous place.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.610 align:middle line:84%
The Cold War was
hotting up again.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:36.945 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We were being sold it.

00:35:36.945 --> 00:35:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Oh, totally.

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.028 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what
he was trying to point out.

00:35:40.028 --> 00:35:41.530 align:middle line:90%
We're being sold the Cold War.

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Totally.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.439 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of
the things that he

00:35:43.439 --> 00:35:46.950 align:middle line:84%
felt that he was under attack
by the government at that time,

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and it's one the reasons after
the November 1971 break-in

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that he disappeared
up to Vancouver.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And for a time, he
was actually thinking

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:00.900 align:middle line:90%
about living in Canada.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Because he felt-- he claimed
that one of the police officers

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:06.000 align:middle line:84%
told him that, you
need to get out,

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.280 align:middle line:90%
because they are after you.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
hadn't he foretold of,

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:13.230 align:middle line:84%
in a thinly disguised manner,
Watergate, for example?

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Well, in terms of the
idea of facsimile documents

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and playing around with
documents, yeah, very much so.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing we
tend to forget with Phil,

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.178 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people
do forget this,

00:36:22.178 --> 00:36:23.559 align:middle line:84%
that Phil didn't
necessarily want

00:36:23.559 --> 00:36:24.850 align:middle line:90%
to be a science fiction writer.

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:28.390 align:middle line:84%
He very much wanted to be taken
seriously as a proper writer.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And in the 1950s, he wrote a
series of books, none of which

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:37.900 align:middle line:84%
were published at the
time, about suburban life

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.544 align:middle line:90%
in Marin County.

00:36:39.544 --> 00:36:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Marin County, yes.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Yeah, Marin.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:41.400 align:middle line:90%
I always pronounce it wrong.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.907 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was raised
partly in Marin County, yes.

00:36:43.907 --> 00:36:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: All, right.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.400 align:middle line:84%
I've always wanted to
go there after reading

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.570 align:middle line:90%
about Phil's experiences there.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:48.350 align:middle line:90%
It sounds a beautiful place.

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's an
interesting place.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.700 align:middle line:90%
Stunning.

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: And again, as
an interesting aside,

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:55.840 align:middle line:84%
in one of his novels, which
I cannot remember the name

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.480 align:middle line:84%
of the particular novel, but
there is a UFO group who are

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.950 align:middle line:84%
believing that the world
is about to come to an end.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And the character that is the
Phil, quasi-Phil character

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:10.890 align:middle line:84%
gets sucked into this worldview
of this apocalyptic worldview

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:12.880 align:middle line:90%
that the world is about to end.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And of course, again,
what was intriguing was

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:17.730 align:middle line:84%
that-- I think I'm right in
saying-- that it was only

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.920 align:middle line:84%
subsequent to Phil
writing that there

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.510 align:middle line:90%
was the cult of Bo and Peep.

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
ended up, I think,

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:28.330 align:middle line:84%
dying of some kind
of curious thing.

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we had
the Solar Temple as well.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.555 align:middle line:84%
So there were these kind
of apocalyptic groups

00:37:32.555 --> 00:37:34.324 align:middle line:84%
that Phil was attuning
into at the time.

00:37:34.324 --> 00:37:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
he was also tuning

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.180 align:middle line:90%
into Nixon and his future.

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Nixon figures
prominently in some of this.

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:40.890 align:middle line:90%
So maybe it's time to go there.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when he--
that statement was

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.090 align:middle line:84%
made about the
resurgence of Nixon

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:48.400 align:middle line:84%
in 1968, where he would reclaim
his power, when he was toast,

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.920 align:middle line:84%
he was dead, politically
dead, at the time that this

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.820 align:middle line:84%
was written, which was
1963, and then also

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:57.080 align:middle line:84%
the character of
Ferris F. Farnsworth,

00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:00.270 align:middle line:84%
and what that actually
meant numerologically.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Yes, of course.

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:02.519 align:middle line:90%
I'd not thought about, either.

00:38:02.519 --> 00:38:05.380 align:middle line:84%
So he's actually playing on
the idea of numerology and 666,

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.200 align:middle line:90%
I guess, which is interesting.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.590 align:middle line:84%
He has these ambivalent
political characters.

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And in "Radio Free
Albemuth," there

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:19.060 align:middle line:84%
is the negative president
that is creating fear.

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
president at that stage

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.680 align:middle line:84%
believes and has people
believe that there

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:28.460 align:middle line:84%
is this underground movement
that are trying to overthrow

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:30.887 align:middle line:84%
Western values and
American values,

00:38:30.887 --> 00:38:33.095 align:middle line:84%
and again, the central
character, Nicholas Brady, who

00:38:33.095 --> 00:38:36.670 align:middle line:84%
is the Philip K. Dick character,
who has a series of events

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:39.590 align:middle line:84%
taking place in his life,
which again parallel completely

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Phil's 2-3-74 events.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.740 align:middle line:84%
As you probably
know, Phil claimed

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:47.980 align:middle line:84%
that he diagnosed a birth
defect, an inguinal hernia,

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.820 align:middle line:90%
that his son Christopher had.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:55.050 align:middle line:84%
The story there is not quite
as Phil stated it, by the way.

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I did actually discuss with
Tess this in great detail,

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.430 align:middle line:84%
and Tess was the only
person that was there.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Phil gives the
impression that he

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.600 align:middle line:84%
had this-- he heard--
he was listening

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.460 align:middle line:84%
to the Beatles singing
"Strawberry Fields

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.660 align:middle line:90%
Are Forever."

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.850 align:middle line:84%
As he was listening to it,
the Beatles' voices changed,

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:14.010 align:middle line:84%
and they started
to sing, your son

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:15.522 align:middle line:90%
has an inoperable birth defect.

00:39:15.522 --> 00:39:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you better
get him to hospital

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:18.313 align:middle line:90%
because he's going to die.

00:39:18.313 --> 00:39:21.032 align:middle line:10%
So Phil comes running out of
his bedroom, says to Tess,

00:39:21.032 --> 00:39:22.240 align:middle line:10%
Christopher is seriously ill.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.520 align:middle line:90%
We've got to do something.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.197 align:middle line:84%
Tess and him grab
Christopher, drive him

00:39:25.197 --> 00:39:27.030 align:middle line:84%
to the doctor's, the
doctors say, whoa, God.

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:28.570 align:middle line:84%
It's a good job you
came, because Christopher

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:29.520 align:middle line:90%
would have died.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.540 align:middle line:90%
That's not how it happened.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:35.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Christopher--
it was a good year later

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.960 align:middle line:84%
before they did anything
with Christopher.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:41.309 align:middle line:84%
And also as far as I understand
it from talking to Tess,

00:39:41.309 --> 00:39:43.350 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm right in saying
that Phil didn't have

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:45.474 align:middle line:84%
a record player in his
bedroom, this kind of thing.

00:39:45.474 --> 00:39:46.670 align:middle line:90%
It was in the living room.

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:49.075 align:middle line:84%
So there's a certain
degree of embroidery there.

00:39:49.075 --> 00:39:50.520 align:middle line:90%
But Phil was a novelist.

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:54.180 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand
that Phil wrote

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.270 align:middle line:84%
about the world in the
way he perceived it to be.

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not to pound on it,
but Richard Milhous Nixon,

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Tricky Dick, but let's go
back there a little bit again,

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:05.640 align:middle line:84%
because wasn't there something
in his writings about--

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.330 align:middle line:84%
and I can't remember what--
about a theme in which

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:12.300 align:middle line:84%
the only way this particular
character could ever

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.280 align:middle line:84%
take office was if everyone
before him was eliminated

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.916 align:middle line:90%
through assassination?

00:40:16.916 --> 00:40:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Right again.

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:20.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the story I don't know, but
I don't know all of his stuff.

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:21.890 align:middle line:84%
But that's an interesting
idea, isn't it?

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And he idea, the
implication being

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.650 align:middle line:84%
that Nixon had in some
way been responsible

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:28.335 align:middle line:84%
for the assassination
of the Kennedys.

00:40:28.335 --> 00:40:30.576 align:middle line:84%
Which it's amazing he got
away with that, really,

00:40:30.576 --> 00:40:31.510 align:middle line:90%
to be honest.

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that was what
I was alluding to, absolutely.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I found it interesting
the notion that five years

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:41.010 align:middle line:84%
in advance, in a
1963 publication,

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:44.840 align:middle line:84%
that he had foretold of
Nixon's rise back to power.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And what that triggered in me,
and I don't want to name names,

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.400 align:middle line:84%
but I was sitting in a
certain place along the river

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:54.690 align:middle line:84%
with someone who has a
lot of inside connections

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and was telling me that
in this next election,

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:02.320 align:middle line:84%
this is who will be
put up as the candidate

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.326 align:middle line:84%
and then told me all
the politics behind it.

00:41:04.326 --> 00:41:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And this was four years
before it occurred.

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.181 align:middle line:84%
And that's why-- you know,
a few things like that

00:41:08.181 --> 00:41:10.540 align:middle line:84%
had me wondering, was
he tapping into this?

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Did he have access to anyone
who had this kind of knowledge,

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:16.934 align:middle line:84%
such as this insider
who I will not mention?

00:41:16.934 --> 00:41:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: That's an
interesting idea, isn't it?

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Because Phil's, again,
in "Radio Free Albemuth,"

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:23.830 align:middle line:84%
the descriptions
and the things he

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:27.890 align:middle line:84%
writes in there show a very,
very political angle, which

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:31.810 align:middle line:84%
is to a degree quite unusual
for Phil in the sense

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:36.237 align:middle line:84%
that he would write novels that
were like space operas-- well,

00:41:36.237 --> 00:41:37.320 align:middle line:90%
they weren't space operas.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Phil never wrote space operas.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.200 align:middle line:84%
But they were very much
located on other planets

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.694 align:middle line:90%
or in a dystopian future.

00:41:42.694 --> 00:41:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which would
kind of make sense

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.220 align:middle line:84%
with the alien potential
interface of his youth.

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.053 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Absolutely.

00:41:47.053 --> 00:41:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in "Radio
Free Albemuth,"

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.720 align:middle line:90%
it is the very near future.

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And in fact a friend of
mine, John Allen Simon,

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:57.680 align:middle line:90%
has just brought out the movie.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.044 align:middle line:84%
And they made a movie of
"Radio Free Albemuth," which

00:42:00.044 --> 00:42:01.710 align:middle line:84%
is well worth checking
out, because it's

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:02.680 align:middle line:90%
an excellent version.

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:07.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it's probably the best
movie made on a Philip K. Dick

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.540 align:middle line:90%
story I've ever seen.

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as he
goes on now, he's

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.060 align:middle line:90%
becoming a person of interest.

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.370 align:middle line:90%
You alluded to this earlier.

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:14.911 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to
be a sci-fi writer.

00:42:14.911 --> 00:42:16.510 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to be taken seriously.

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:20.440 align:middle line:84%
However, it sounds as though
his publisher forced upon him

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:24.570 align:middle line:84%
the notion of taking everything
more into a sci-fi category.

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Was this the Scott
Meredith publishing company

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.770 align:middle line:84%
or another one at that
time, do you know?

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:29.686 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: I don't know.

00:42:29.686 --> 00:42:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Scott Meredith I
know was his agent.

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and he
was relaying the info

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.020 align:middle line:90%
from the publishing agent.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.200 align:middle line:84%
They need you to pump
it up on the sci-fi.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.364 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:42:39.364 --> 00:42:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that the
intelligence communities

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.120 align:middle line:90%
were that afraid of him?

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: I wonder
whether they particularly

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:50.050 align:middle line:84%
knew about him at the time, the
early time when he was actually

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:54.017 align:middle line:84%
writing more and
more short stories.

00:42:54.017 --> 00:42:55.100 align:middle line:90%
And I genuinely don't now.

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.929 align:middle line:84%
I think at the early stage,
they probably at a low level

00:42:57.929 --> 00:42:59.720 align:middle line:84%
were aware of him, but
they didn't probably

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.740 align:middle line:90%
see him as a danger.

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:06.440 align:middle line:84%
I think it was only
later when he started

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to really get involved and
become more famous, I think,

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:12.510 align:middle line:84%
that people probably started
to be more aware of him.

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, Phil himself
had elements of paranoia within

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.545 align:middle line:84%
himself that he would actually
see slights and threats

00:43:18.545 --> 00:43:20.460 align:middle line:90%
and dangers where there weren't.

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And he would readily
agree that himself.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:26.459 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of
the science fiction

00:43:26.459 --> 00:43:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and his being forced
down that route,

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I think it was basically because
he was a very good science

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:31.910 align:middle line:90%
fiction writer.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you read his novels, his
serious novels, they are good,

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:43.660 align:middle line:84%
but Phil's imagination is
so restricted by the genre

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:47.220 align:middle line:84%
of realistic realism
and writing realism

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.270 align:middle line:84%
that he couldn't
really fly in the way

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:51.180 align:middle line:90%
that he can with his novels.

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And in his novels, he can create
the most amazing scenarios,

00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:59.765 align:middle line:84%
and he will usually-- and
usually mostly of his scenarios

00:43:59.765 --> 00:44:01.470 align:middle line:84%
were based normally
upon very, very

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:03.610 align:middle line:84%
powerful philosophical
constructs,

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:06.450 align:middle line:84%
theological constructs, that
he could embroider around

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:08.600 align:middle line:84%
them and allow his
imagination to fly.

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Whereas a normal,
straightforward novel,

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:11.900 align:middle line:90%
probably he couldn't.

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So of his
books, which one

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:17.130 align:middle line:84%
do you think addressed
most strongly the notion

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:21.200 align:middle line:84%
that we are living a completely
constructed, false reality?

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: I think
probably "Ubik."

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Because "Ubik" is
a fascinating novel

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:29.710 align:middle line:84%
that you can read on so
many different levels.

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:32.120 align:middle line:84%
But effectively,
the central premise

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:35.840 align:middle line:84%
is that we are all
effectively stuck

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.870 align:middle line:84%
in this kind of
almost bardo state.

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And certain people are
outside of the bardo state

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.320 align:middle line:90%
sending messages in to us.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a very,
very clever storyline.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But effectively,
that's the basic idea

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:48.790 align:middle line:90%
and the basic premise.

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So there are messages being
sent in from elsewhere.

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.250 align:middle line:90%
Messages where somebody's--

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does the word
Archon come into this at all?

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Not particularly
in this case,

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.760 align:middle line:84%
although there is an argument
to say that, again, it

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.680 align:middle line:84%
is somebody outside
of the construct who's

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.110 align:middle line:84%
trying to communicate
with people

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:05.180 align:middle line:90%
who are inside the construct.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also maybe
control perceptions of people

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:08.840 align:middle line:90%
within the construct.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: Oh, totally.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Effectively, that's
one of the major issues

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:16.340 align:middle line:84%
in "Ubik" is that
ubik, ubiquitous,

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:20.140 align:middle line:84%
the actual substance,
starts to control,

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:24.570 align:middle line:84%
and ubik itself
becomes God, in effect.

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:27.410 align:middle line:84%
It is everything, and
it controls everything,

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:31.050 align:middle line:84%
and it is an emanation
of everything.

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:33.660 align:middle line:84%
But in the novel, for
instance, things happen,

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:38.890 align:middle line:84%
messages are written, somebody's
head appears on a dollar sign.

00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Everything is then
going into entropy,

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:44.136 align:middle line:84%
and it's all sort of winding
backwards and everything.

00:45:44.136 --> 00:45:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Very, very clever novel,
and I would strongly

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:47.735 align:middle line:90%
advise anybody to read it.

00:45:47.735 --> 00:45:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Because to me, I
think it's probably,

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.635 align:middle line:84%
after "VALIS," his
most powerful novel.

00:45:52.635 --> 00:45:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you listen to some
of the people I've interviewed,

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.780 align:middle line:84%
they'd say what he was
talking about is our reality.

00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Oh, if you actually
read Philip K. Dick,

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:05.800 align:middle line:84%
and you have a knowledge
of Gnosticism, the Kabalah,

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.120 align:middle line:84%
if you have knowledge
of Zoroastrianism

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and various other theological
and philosophical concepts,

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.570 align:middle line:84%
you'll suddenly find that
what Phil was writing

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:17.530 align:middle line:90%
was effective Gnosticism.

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:19.090 align:middle line:84%
William Blake came
up with the idea

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:20.860 align:middle line:90%
of the mind-forged manacles.

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Philip K. Dick comes up
with the black iron prison,

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:25.590 align:middle line:84%
the same kind of
concept, the idea

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:28.880 align:middle line:84%
that we are trapped in
some kind of simulation.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, his
very last novel that

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.280 align:middle line:84%
remains unpublished, because
I think he wrote at least two

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.890 align:middle line:84%
or three different versions
of it, "The Owl in Daylight,"

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:39.110 align:middle line:90%
has exactly that.

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:41.327 align:middle line:84%
And there's a sequence
in "The Owl in Daylight"

00:46:41.327 --> 00:46:43.660 align:middle line:84%
where the central character
is trapped within a computer

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:44.470 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:45.928 align:middle line:84%
It's not really a
computer program;

00:46:45.928 --> 00:46:48.390 align:middle line:84%
it's a kind of a
program of a theme park.

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And the central
character's trapped.

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And his daughter is sent
from outside the program

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:57.679 align:middle line:84%
into the program to
speak to her father

00:46:57.679 --> 00:46:59.220 align:middle line:84%
to convince him of
the fact that he's

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.160 align:middle line:90%
living within the simulation.

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Now again, in one of his other
novels, he discusses this.

00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:08.430 align:middle line:84%
In "The Divine Invasion,"
we have again the idea

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:12.807 align:middle line:84%
that we are God and God
has forgotten who he is.

00:47:12.807 --> 00:47:14.890 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we are all
emanations of something

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:15.700 align:middle line:90%
greater.

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But we're trapped
and being fooled

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:23.185 align:middle line:84%
by what the Gnostics would
call Yaldabaoth, the Demiurge.

00:47:23.185 --> 00:47:25.040 align:middle line:84%
The Demiurge has
created this illusion,

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.590 align:middle line:84%
and we're trapped within it,
and only certain individuals

00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:28.570 align:middle line:90%
see through it.

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And Phil would argue that it's
only by training your mind

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.800 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you can see
through the illusion, which

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.032 align:middle line:90%
of course is the matrix.

00:47:37.032 --> 00:47:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of course
it's the matrix, yes.

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And you're also a friend
of Kingsley Dennis, who

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.570 align:middle line:84%
I'll be interviewing
in another day or so.

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And as you were speaking,
what I was seeing

00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:49.410 align:middle line:84%
was that perhaps
that's what he's

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:51.700 align:middle line:84%
talking about with the
Phoenix Generation.

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps these children
that are coming in

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:55.930 align:middle line:84%
are the ones, as
the daughter was,

00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:58.300 align:middle line:84%
that are reaching into
our reality and saying,

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:01.097 align:middle line:84%
you are-- what you're
seeing is not all there is.

00:48:01.097 --> 00:48:01.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:04.091 align:middle line:84%
There's so much more
to your reality.

00:48:04.091 --> 00:48:05.340 align:middle line:90%
What would you say about that?

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:06.798 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: I totally
agree with that.

00:48:06.798 --> 00:48:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Kingsley sent me an
advance PDF of the book,

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:10.450 align:middle line:90%
and it blew me away.

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:11.360 align:middle line:90%
No, very much so.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.634 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful book.

00:48:12.634 --> 00:48:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.883 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking forward
to that interview.

00:48:14.883 --> 00:48:16.970 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to align
perfectly with what you're

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:19.800 align:middle line:84%
saying about this notion of the
story of the daughter reaching

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:20.300 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.174 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Yeah, it's kind
of the breakthrough.

00:48:22.174 --> 00:48:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Because effectively, the
world has severe problems

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:25.140 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And there is something
definitely not

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.730 align:middle line:90%
right with the way things are.

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:30.605 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, and, you
know, I think about it

00:48:30.605 --> 00:48:32.670 align:middle line:84%
from a very practical
point of view,

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:35.740 align:middle line:84%
just a functional
point of view, how

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.490 align:middle line:84%
we're so habituated to such
a small spectrum of reality,

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:40.700 align:middle line:90%
every one of us.

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:43.632 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a rare one,
maybe some of the little ones,

00:48:43.632 --> 00:48:45.590 align:middle line:84%
maybe the Philip K. Dicks
of the world are not.

00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:50.300 align:middle line:84%
But I think how embarrassed
I am, personally even,

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.780 align:middle line:84%
that I'm so habituated
that I would drive

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.550 align:middle line:84%
the same way to the
same place each time

00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:56.280 align:middle line:84%
when there might be
10 different routes.

00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Something as simple as breaking
that habituation in our mind

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.800 align:middle line:84%
and taking a different
route to a place

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:05.890 align:middle line:84%
is the beginning of breaking out
of the matrix, as simple as it

00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:09.300 align:middle line:84%
sounds, of just not ordering
the exact same cup of coffee

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:10.780 align:middle line:90%
the same way every morning.

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:14.320 align:middle line:84%
This is that program that we
have been habituated into.

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're sold it every single
moment of our lives, if we're

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:19.992 align:middle line:84%
and about, around other
people, media, et cetera.

00:49:19.992 --> 00:49:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: No, I totally agree.

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.384 align:middle line:84%
We do live in this world
where we're sold ideas,

00:49:24.384 --> 00:49:25.300 align:middle line:90%
we're sold everything.

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.883 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's what
Phil would argue.

00:49:26.883 --> 00:49:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Phil with preoccupied
with advertising

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and how advertising works,
how it manipulates us,

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:35.090 align:middle line:84%
how newspapers manipulate
our thoughts and ideas.

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm of the opinion that
even the way we perceive reality

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.846 align:middle line:84%
is very much part of what we
are told we should perceive.

00:49:42.846 --> 00:49:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: The term
that I've come across,

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.469 align:middle line:84%
which I use quite
regularly at the moment,

00:49:47.469 --> 00:49:50.160 align:middle line:84%
is electromagnetic
chauvinism, the idea

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.180 align:middle line:84%
that we believe what we
see out there is real,

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:54.266 align:middle line:84%
because this is what
our eyes tell us.

00:49:54.266 --> 00:49:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Well of course, we're
seeing such a tiny part

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:57.880 align:middle line:90%
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.120 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, to say
that this is reality-- we

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.470 align:middle line:84%
also, the way we perceive
time, as Phil would argue

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:06.050 align:middle line:84%
with orthogonal time, is
that we think this-- the way

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:09.640 align:middle line:84%
we perceive time is now
the way time is perceived.

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Yet we know that animals
with greater metabolic rates

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:15.970 align:middle line:84%
perceive time much
slower than we do.

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:18.660 align:middle line:84%
So we are being chauvinists
in terms of our time,

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:21.430 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our perceptions,
in terms of everything

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:22.680 align:middle line:90%
we create around us.

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as some of his
themes would have indicated,

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:29.660 align:middle line:90%
we have eyes on us, so to speak.

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:30.640 align:middle line:90%
We're being controlled.

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.139 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look at it from
the point of view of the media

00:50:33.139 --> 00:50:36.110 align:middle line:84%
alone, as I interviewed
Richard Dolan one time, talking

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:39.360 align:middle line:84%
about the notion of the
reality of the presence

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:42.990 align:middle line:84%
of the intelligence communities
in almost all media,

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:45.360 align:middle line:84%
I think in Britain as
well as in America.

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:48.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's just
America, where at key positions

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.090 align:middle line:84%
there's intelligence
that is guiding

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:54.197 align:middle line:84%
our perception for reasons far
beyond them, I would imagine.

00:50:54.197 --> 00:50:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Yes, because it's one
of the ongoing mysteries to me,

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:59.340 align:middle line:84%
is that we are being
manipulated to believe

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.300 align:middle line:90%
certain things in certain ways.

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And you try to think of what's
the ongoing game plan here?

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:07.780 align:middle line:84%
If we're being manipulated
to think in a certain way,

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:09.550 align:middle line:90%
why are we being manipulated?

00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:10.660 align:middle line:90%
What is the endgame?

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:12.920 align:middle line:84%
What is the reasons
for these things?

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:16.452 align:middle line:84%
And as I get older, I've become
even more confused about it,

00:51:16.452 --> 00:51:18.285 align:middle line:84%
to be honest, as to
where the world is going

00:51:18.285 --> 00:51:20.645 align:middle line:84%
and what the game play--
one could argue, I mean,

00:51:20.645 --> 00:51:22.520 align:middle line:84%
for many years I've very
much been a believer

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:25.110 align:middle line:84%
of the cock-up
theory of history,

00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:27.990 align:middle line:84%
that there isn't any
really grand design,

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:31.140 align:middle line:84%
that people just knee-jerk
because the people in power

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:33.360 align:middle line:84%
are no more intelligent
than we are.

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.554 align:middle line:84%
They just have access
to more information.

00:51:35.554 --> 00:51:37.470 align:middle line:84%
But if they do have
access to more information

00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:39.928 align:middle line:84%
than we do, why do they make
the bizarre decisions they do?

00:51:39.928 --> 00:51:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.490 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:47.090 align:middle line:84%
In Philip K. Dick's work, what
would you say is-- is there--

00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:49.620 align:middle line:90%
it was so dystopian in nature.

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
that really gives us

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:55.140 align:middle line:90%
some hope toward our future?

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: I think the
thing that-- if we're

00:51:57.570 --> 00:52:03.665 align:middle line:84%
taking Philip K. Dick as being
the philosopher and the prophet

00:52:03.665 --> 00:52:05.700 align:middle line:84%
of our future, I
think the one thing

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:09.640 align:middle line:84%
that Phil is, he was
a wonderful humorist.

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:12.660 align:middle line:90%
He saw the ridiculous in things.

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:16.050 align:middle line:84%
I think in many ways a lot
of people misread Philip K.

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:19.761 align:middle line:84%
Dick because they think he's
being serious when in fact he's

00:52:19.761 --> 00:52:20.260 align:middle line:90%
not.

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:24.140 align:middle line:84%
You know his tongue
is firmly in his cheek

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.760 align:middle line:84%
when he does these things
and plays these things.

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:31.510 align:middle line:84%
So effectively, I think that,
in general, Phil's novels

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:33.910 align:middle line:84%
do not have a
great deal of hope.

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
very few of them

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:42.110 align:middle line:84%
in which the central
character receives absolution

00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:46.570 align:middle line:90%
or he succeeds in his actions.

00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:48.910 align:middle line:84%
He tends to be
worn down by it all

00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and tends to end up almost
being resigned to it all.

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think in many ways,
without Phil's worldview,

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:59.345 align:middle line:84%
that you can fight and fight
against the powers that be,

00:52:59.345 --> 00:53:00.720 align:middle line:84%
but in the final
analysis, you're

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.540 align:middle line:84%
still a little man
fighting a big world.

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:05.510 align:middle line:90%


00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:07.694 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to believe
that within it all, as he

00:53:07.694 --> 00:53:09.360 align:middle line:84%
was getting towards
the end of his life,

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.860 align:middle line:84%
he was starting to
see this greater

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:14.720 align:middle line:84%
picture, the idea of the
concept of VALIS, the idea

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:18.050 align:middle line:84%
that there is something
outside of ourselves.

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that
had he lived longer

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:24.085 align:middle line:84%
than he did, dying tragically
young, that his novels would

00:53:24.085 --> 00:53:27.140 align:middle line:84%
have probably brought
out a lot of the themes

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:28.430 align:middle line:90%
that were fascinating him.

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And I strongly advise
anybody, if you

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.700 align:middle line:84%
get the opportunity--
it's a long, hard read,

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:36.390 align:middle line:84%
but get hold of a copy of "The
Exegesis" and just dip into it.

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll see
that his mind was

00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:41.140 align:middle line:84%
going in a myriad of
different directions,

00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:44.160 align:middle line:84%
and it's fascinating to just
postulate which direction

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.032 align:middle line:90%
he would have taken.

00:53:45.032 --> 00:53:47.240 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to believe he would
have taken the direction

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:50.550 align:middle line:84%
that he was following with one
of the versions, the version

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:53.880 align:middle line:84%
of "The Owl in Daylight"
with the computer program.

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that's the
area Phil would move into.

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the area now
that an awful lot of writers

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and scientists and philosophers
are moving towards,

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.930 align:middle line:84%
this idea of the
simulation argument.

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And one can only
hope that once he

00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:11.570 align:middle line:84%
was released from his
physical reality, which

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:13.510 align:middle line:84%
was so torturous
and painful for him,

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:16.620 align:middle line:84%
that on some level, whether
it be something that happens

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:20.530 align:middle line:84%
by one's own spiritual awareness
or otherwise, he and his sister

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:23.140 align:middle line:84%
were reunited, because
a lot of his torture,

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:26.360 align:middle line:84%
a lot of his feeling of this
shame of being the survivor,

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:28.840 align:middle line:84%
really impacted him
throughout his entire life.

00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Oh, totally, and it's
a wonderful idea, because I'm

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:35.280 align:middle line:84%
reminded of the sad
idea that Phil lived

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:38.610 align:middle line:84%
his whole life knowing that
on a hillside in Colorado

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:40.800 align:middle line:84%
was a tombstone,
and on the tombstone

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.680 align:middle line:90%
was the name of Jane Dick.

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And Philip K. Dick,
Philip Kindred Dick,

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:48.880 align:middle line:84%
was also carved in it with just
the filling in of the dates.

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought the idea of the
reunification with his sister

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:55.570 align:middle line:84%
would have been of
profound importance to him.

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Had she lived, he
may not have been

00:54:57.890 --> 00:55:00.070 align:middle line:84%
the writer he was,
because of course writers

00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:01.910 align:middle line:90%
write through pain.

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:05.800 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to believe
that that reunification was

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:10.304 align:middle line:84%
for him perfection and that
he and his sister moved on.

00:55:10.304 --> 00:55:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Because in most
of his novels, you

00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:14.305 align:middle line:84%
have the ongoing theme
of the dark-haired girl.

00:55:14.305 --> 00:55:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:16.280 align:middle line:90%
I got chills when you said that.

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: And it clearly is her.

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: The Shekinah,
his Shekinah.

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:21.159 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
Shekinah, his Sophia.

00:55:21.159 --> 00:55:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: His Sophia.

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, we only
have a minute or so left.

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.410 align:middle line:10%
You're involved with a
documentary out of France

00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:31.371 align:middle line:10%
right now that you say sounds
to be really impeccable in what

00:55:31.371 --> 00:55:32.120 align:middle line:10%
they're going to--

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.510 align:middle line:10%
>>PEAKE: Yeah, it's about
some of the subjects

00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:36.610 align:middle line:10%
we're discussing today
about Philip K. Dick seeing

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:41.390 align:middle line:10%
the future as some form
of prophet with a small p.

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:43.390 align:middle line:10%
And the director
is Denis Delestrac,

00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:47.550 align:middle line:10%
who has done a series of
absolutely superb documentaries

00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:48.320 align:middle line:10%
in the past.

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:52.120 align:middle line:84%
He took a team who worked
their way down the Nile River,

00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:53.070 align:middle line:90%
"Secrets of the Nile."

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:56.360 align:middle line:84%
He's also done a movie
called "Sand Wars."

00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And the quality of the
filming is phenomenal.

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And he interviews a lot
of the major characters

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:03.780 align:middle line:90%
in Phil's life.

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And he has a fascinating
interview with Rutger Hauer

00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:09.390 align:middle line:84%
as well, which he tells
me is absolutely superb.

00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:12.174 align:middle line:84%
He interviews Tessa and
various other individuals.

00:56:12.174 --> 00:56:13.340 align:middle line:90%
This is well worth watching.

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:14.236 align:middle line:90%
And it is in English.

00:56:14.236 --> 00:56:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is in English.

00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:16.340 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: It is in English.

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:17.450 align:middle line:90%
So it will be subtitled for--

00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
feature prominently now.

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: I do, apparently,
yes, which is rather nice.

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Can't wait to see it,
2015 sometime, right?

00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PEAKE: It will be, yes.

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hopefully.

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
your time, Anthony.

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PEAKE: Thank you very
much for inviting me.

00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:28.314 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:28.314 --> 00:56:33.947 align:middle line:90%
