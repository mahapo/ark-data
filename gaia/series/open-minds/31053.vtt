>>REGINA MEREDITH: You've likely
already seen my first interview

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.450 align:middle line:84%
with Susan Lindauer,
in which we talked

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.970 align:middle line:84%
about how she was
identified as an Iraqi agent

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and put in federal
prison without a trial.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.730 align:middle line:10%
In fact, she was working as
a CIA asset on the ground,

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.530 align:middle line:10%
giving advance warning
of 9/11 and negotiating

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.990 align:middle line:10%
for peaceful
relationships with Iraq.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.880 align:middle line:10%
We continue our
discussion now focusing

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.510 align:middle line:10%
on what happened when she
was taken into custody,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.570 align:middle line:10%
powerless in the
hands of psychiatrists

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.680 align:middle line:10%
colluding with
the US government.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.180 align:middle line:84%
To keep her quiet regarding
her findings of pre-

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and post 9/11 events
in the Middle East,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.740 align:middle line:84%
she had to be found
incompetent to stand trial.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.500 align:middle line:84%
This is where her fight for
her life and her mind began.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.490 align:middle line:90%
And I welcome you back Susan.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.840 align:middle line:90%
What an incredible story.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.190 align:middle line:84%
By now, I think people are
familiar with the first part

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.129 align:middle line:90%
of the story.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.840 align:middle line:84%
But one thing we didn't
go into there as they're

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:84%
trying to prove
that you're crazy,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.650 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that you
were alerting them

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.570 align:middle line:84%
to events that were
going to be coming down,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:84%
this was in August of
2001 in lower Manhattan,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.100 align:middle line:84%
involving airplanes, and
specifically the World Trade

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.620 align:middle line:90%
Center.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.310 align:middle line:84%
You can't get more
specific than that.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.716 align:middle line:84%
And as I was reading
about your story

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:84%
and reading in the book what you
were specifically warning them

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.830 align:middle line:84%
of, I was reminded of a document
that came across shortly

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.330 align:middle line:90%
after 9/11.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.840 align:middle line:84%
It was regarding
David Shippers, who

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.460 align:middle line:84%
was the lead counsel who
was leading the impeachment

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.710 align:middle line:84%
proceedings against
Clinton, right?

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.330 align:middle line:84%
He had been approached by FBI
agents, and I have it all here.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:84%
I went back into my old
files and found this.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I printed it out on
November 11, 2001,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.460 align:middle line:84%
so it originated
sometime before that.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, FBI agents had
come to him for legal protection

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.510 align:middle line:84%
because they were telling the
managers of the departments

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.390 align:middle line:84%
above them, I don't know the
vernacular for their industry,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.080 align:middle line:84%
that these events
were coming down also.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Each one of them was saying,
instead of listening,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:84%
they were being put
on leaves of absence.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.714 align:middle line:90%
Some were even being fired.

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So they came to
him for protection

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.380 align:middle line:84%
because they had to break
their national security oath

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.090 align:middle line:90%
to divulge this information.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And now, this is a
high-profile individual

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle line:90%
who tried to go public.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.320 align:middle line:84%
He even went on the
"Alex Jones Show."

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.010 align:middle line:84%
This is when you were
doing the same thing

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.740 align:middle line:90%
on the inside channels.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Shippers went so far as to
go on the "Alex Jones Show"

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.542 align:middle line:90%
and talk about this.

00:02:31.542 --> 00:02:33.875 align:middle line:84%
Now, no one has probably heard
his name, a lot of people

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:90%
have never heard your name.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.085 align:middle line:90%
He disappeared.

00:02:36.085 --> 00:02:38.459 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know where he
is now and what he's doing,

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.826 align:middle line:90%
but you don't find much on him.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SUSAN LINDAUER: No.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So he was--

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Most
people go into hiding

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.290 align:middle line:90%
after these sorts of things.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happens-- now, he
went on the "Alex Jones Show,"

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.638 align:middle line:90%
we know what happened to you.

00:02:46.638 --> 00:02:48.780 align:middle line:84%
What is the common
scenario if someone chooses

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.310 align:middle line:84%
to speak when the government
does not want them

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.430 align:middle line:84%
to-- what would have
happened theoretically

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.180 align:middle line:90%
to him and others?

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.304 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: They are fired.

00:02:55.304 --> 00:02:59.600 align:middle line:10%
They are blacklisted so
they cannot get other work.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:07.050 align:middle line:10%
In my case, my CIA handler
was paid off $13 million.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And he was paid off from
money for the emergency

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.160 align:middle line:84%
appropriations for the
9/11 investigation.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Wait, to deny you?

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.635 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: To forget
the 9/11 story.

00:03:16.635 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, to
forget the 9/11 story.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.620 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because he
had knowledge too.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.169 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And
then I was arrested.

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And after my arrest, he
refused to acknowledge

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.644 align:middle line:84%
that he'd worked with
me for nine years.

00:03:26.644 --> 00:03:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to set
this up because we

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.630 align:middle line:90%
didn't get to that part.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we're not
focusing a lot on 9/11

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.670 align:middle line:84%
is because it's
been done to death.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:84%
If anyone doesn't know by
now that it was an inside job

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.720 align:middle line:84%
and that they at least expected
it and had full advance

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:84%
knowledge, then there are
plenty of books out there.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.490 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to continue on.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.034 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to validate
that with this too.

00:03:47.034 --> 00:03:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: It's really
important because what

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.687 align:middle line:84%
happened to me regarding
9/11 and the cover up we're

00:03:54.687 --> 00:03:55.770 align:middle line:90%
going to talk today about.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.895 align:middle line:84%
Everything we're talking
about the cover up of Iraq

00:03:57.895 --> 00:03:59.542 align:middle line:84%
also applies to the
cover up of 9/11.

00:03:59.542 --> 00:04:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And it
especially applies to 9/11

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.870 align:middle line:84%
because the judge in my
case, Michael Mukasey,

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
was also hearing the insurance
claims for Larry Silverstein.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And the $7 billion
payout that Larry Silverstein

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.233 align:middle line:84%
was demanding from the
insurance companies.

00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:18.899 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: My attorneys
used to cross paths

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:84%
with his attorneys
in the courthouse.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And there were times when I was
brought in shackles in front

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.680 align:middle line:84%
of Judge Mukasey and Larry
Silverstein's attorneys

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.600 align:middle line:90%
would be there.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, your
honor, we knew about 9/11.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Please, I beg you for hearing.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.280 align:middle line:90%
I beg you to hear my witnesses.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Let my witnesses confront them.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Ask them any questions you
want, but let me testify.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Let me prove this to you.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
terrifying experience

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:90%
and it was baffling to me.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.920 align:middle line:84%
I was bewildered that
the government could

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.580 align:middle line:84%
lie about our 9/11 warnings
and then turn around and say

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.040 align:middle line:84%
that I was incompetent, though I
gave advance warnings to the US

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.474 align:middle line:90%
Attorney General John Ashcroft.

00:05:13.474 --> 00:05:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And I had
requested, in August of 2001,

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.760 align:middle line:84%
an emergency broadcast alert
across all federal agencies.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.080 align:middle line:84%
So it was my notification
that put the FBI on alert.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
also Shippers, he

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.550 align:middle line:84%
had repeated phone calls
in to John Ashcroft,

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:84%
and he was operating
at a high level.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.450 align:middle line:90%
He refused the phone calls.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.134 align:middle line:84%
Telling him what it was about,
Ashcroft's office and Ashcroft

00:05:39.134 --> 00:05:41.425 align:middle line:84%
would not accept those phone
calls and the information.

00:05:41.425 --> 00:05:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Ashcroft
was a despicable coward

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.334 align:middle line:90%
as far as I was concerned.

00:05:46.334 --> 00:05:48.374 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think that
the record will show that.

00:05:48.374 --> 00:05:48.970 align:middle line:90%
So now--

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.372 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: He was a coward, and
he failed America very badly.

00:05:52.372 --> 00:05:54.205 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing worse
than being a coward

00:05:54.205 --> 00:05:57.920 align:middle line:84%
is to blame somebody else for
your own mistakes to the point

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.575 align:middle line:84%
that you arrest them and
throw them in prison.

00:06:00.575 --> 00:06:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
makes you a coward

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.134 align:middle line:90%
and a criminal in my book.

00:06:03.134 --> 00:06:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.644 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so lets talk
about the crime aspect of this.

00:06:06.644 --> 00:06:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: So, the
crime aspect of this

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.720 align:middle line:90%
was that I was arrested.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And first, I was on bail for
$500,000, which is insulting.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I had to deal with the insult
and the discrediting of being

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.980 align:middle line:84%
labeled sort of a psych
case from day one.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.687 align:middle line:84%
And they said, why did
they do that to you?

00:06:28.687 --> 00:06:30.020 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, are you kidding?

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.800 align:middle line:90%
Why did they not do it to me?

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.634 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they have
to try to discredit me.

00:06:33.634 --> 00:06:36.174 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were getting the
political implications by now.

00:06:36.174 --> 00:06:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Anybody,
anybody could understand

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:84%
the political implications
if they thought

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:84%
about it for more
than five seconds.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
It was a ludicrous argument that
I was this psychiatric case.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And the papers themselves
never showed evidence

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.670 align:middle line:84%
of psychiatric dysfunction
on my part, what they said

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:01.660 align:middle line:84%
was that I was 95%
convinced of my innocence.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I
could not appreciate

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:84%
the gravity of the
charges against me.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And so long as I continued
to demand a hearing,

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:84%
demand the right to disprove
the allegations against me

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:84%
and to show that I had
not broken the law,

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.920 align:middle line:84%
that in itself qualified
as a mental defect, which

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.140 align:middle line:84%
rendered me incapable
of standing for trial.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Delusional and
delusions of grandeur.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes, grandiosity.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Which is what Soviet psychiatry
used throughout the Brezhnev

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and air age and Stalin,
right up through Gorbachev.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:47.890 align:middle line:84%
People forget that in the Soviet
Union, 30% of all activists

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.260 align:middle line:84%
were targeted under
Soviet psychiatry.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.845 align:middle line:84%
They were accused of what they
called sluggish schizophrenia.

00:07:53.845 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.890 align:middle line:84%
These were reformers, and so
they had delusions of reform,

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:04.680 align:middle line:84%
delusions of persecution,
delusions of paranoia.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.150 align:middle line:84%
The belief that
you could actually

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.950 align:middle line:84%
make a difference
and change society,

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and the Soviet psychiatrist
mirroring my situation exactly,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.570 align:middle line:84%
the same vocabulary,
that the individual

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:21.450 align:middle line:84%
would show no outward symptoms
of mental illness other

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.040 align:middle line:90%
than mild neuroses.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:24.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.830 align:middle line:84%
There would be no behavioral
issues in society,

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.500 align:middle line:84%
but the fact that you
opposed the government, what

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.860 align:middle line:84%
we call in the West
oppositional defiance disorder.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.044 align:middle line:90%
I was accused of this.

00:08:39.044 --> 00:08:41.210 align:middle line:84%
I was accused of this and
I was like, oh, thank you.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:41.793 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: ODD.

00:08:41.793 --> 00:08:43.026 align:middle line:90%
There must be a pill for it.

00:08:43.026 --> 00:08:44.150 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get to that.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: We're
going to get to that.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They have really
strong pills for that one.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.363 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: They have
really strong pills for that

00:08:48.363 --> 00:08:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and they are scary
pills, I'll tell you.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, God.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, before we get to the pill
part, let's talk about you

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.520 align:middle line:90%
end up in court.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.300 align:middle line:84%
Now because this falls
under the Patriot Act,

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.480 align:middle line:84%
you have no idea what
you're being accused of.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Your attorney, who--

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: The state-- people
don't understand the Patriot

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Act.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.290 align:middle line:84%
People think the
Patriot Act only

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:13.490 align:middle line:84%
applies to foreign surveillance
of international telephone

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.360 align:middle line:90%
calls.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.810 align:middle line:90%
That is nonsense.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.910 align:middle line:84%
The Patriot Act is
7,000 pages modeled

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:24.030 align:middle line:84%
on the Soviet
criminal code of 1926

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.510 align:middle line:84%
that set up the KGB
and the gulag system.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:31.260 align:middle line:90%
And it relies on secret charges.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.750 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Secret charges, secret evidence,
secret grand jury testimony.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.050 align:middle line:84%
You are never allowed to
know who has accused you--

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of what.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: --of what.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.280 align:middle line:90%
What did I do?

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I don't have to tell you.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.760 align:middle line:90%
You already know.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.380 align:middle line:84%
You'd think it's
like a bad parent.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.304 align:middle line:90%
What did I do wrong, mommy?

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, you already
know what you did wrong.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to tell you.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh, come on.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.060 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to send
me to prison for 25 years,

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.730 align:middle line:90%
you do have to tell me.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
not anymore we don't.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:90%
This is really scary stuff.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But did they
tell your attorney?

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Well--

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does the
attorney have the right

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.260 align:middle line:84%
to know of the secret
charges and secret evidence?

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: This is a
very important question,

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's-- the attorney is
allowed to file for a security

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.080 align:middle line:90%
clearance.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.949 align:middle line:84%
And the attorney is allowed,
after receiving a security

00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:84%
clearance, and some may have
a high security clearance,

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.390 align:middle line:84%
some may have a low
security clearance,

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.260 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
degree, they're allowed

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.410 align:middle line:90%
to receive some information.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.610 align:middle line:84%
However, they are required
to sign a document stating

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:84%
that they will never release
any information to the defendant

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:53.650 align:middle line:84%
on pain of disbarment
from the legal profession,

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.887 align:middle line:84%
financial sanction, or
even criminal prosecution

00:10:56.887 --> 00:10:57.386 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:10:57.386 --> 00:10:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
this is unbelievable.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:84%
You don't know why you're
arrested, you were never told.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.320 align:middle line:84%
You never were privy
to any of the evidence.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
you're inept attorney,

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.960 align:middle line:90%
inept might be a kind word.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.543 align:middle line:84%
It might be there
was collusion there.

00:11:11.543 --> 00:11:13.417 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: He was
absolutely in collusion.

00:11:13.417 --> 00:11:14.500 align:middle line:90%
What happened in my case--

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.958 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he was only given
maybe a small portion of it

00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:17.630 align:middle line:90%
himself.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Not that it would have
mattered because they

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.396 align:middle line:84%
were going to nail
you either way.

00:11:20.396 --> 00:11:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Well, what
happened was after my case was

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:84%
dismissed, my first
attorney, Sam Talkin,

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.240 align:middle line:84%
who we called Sam No Talkin
because he refused to defend

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle line:84%
me, finally handed over legal
documents to the attorney who

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.311 align:middle line:84%
replaced him, Brian Shaughnessy,
who was one of the top

00:11:39.311 --> 00:11:39.810 align:middle line:90%
attorneys--

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who was
a real attorney.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.939 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Who was
a real attorney,

00:11:41.939 --> 00:11:44.530 align:middle line:84%
one of the top attorneys in
Washington, great attorney,

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.710 align:middle line:90%
now retired.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And we found in that a
non-disclosure agreement.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Three weeks after the
non-disclosure agreement,

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.210 align:middle line:84%
I was declared incompetent
to stand trial.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was never allowed
to know that there

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:04.400 align:middle line:84%
had been a secret debriefing
at the Justice Department.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.190 align:middle line:84%
I was declared incompetent
on the basis of my belief

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.410 align:middle line:90%
in my innocence.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.110 align:middle line:84%
I continued to be
free and I continued

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:84%
to demand a trial right up until
I was hauled into court one

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.090 align:middle line:84%
day in September and
two things had happened.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us the dates
on the chronology of events.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.910 align:middle line:90%
You were arrested on what day?

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I was arrested
in March 11, 2004.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I was on bail
until September 23, 2005.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: 18 months.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:90%
No court dates.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:43.890 align:middle line:90%
No action on my case--

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For a terrorist.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.588 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: --for a year and
a half with no court meetings.

00:12:47.588 --> 00:12:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For an Iraqi agent?

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.140 align:middle line:90%
For a traitor?

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: No court.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.130 align:middle line:84%
All they wanted was to keep
me out of the election.

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.630 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to get
me out of the way

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:84%
because George Bush was running
for office against John Kerry.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.440 align:middle line:84%
It was a ferocious
election fight,

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and George Bush knew that if
the American people discovered

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.270 align:middle line:84%
the we gave advance
warnings about 9/11

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and there was a peace option
on the table with Iraq,

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.650 align:middle line:90%
he never had a chance.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.530 align:middle line:84%
So he was a dirty, ugly,
corrupt, selfish, weak

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:19.710 align:middle line:90%
politician.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.064 align:middle line:84%
Very, very selfish, very,
very dangerous in my opinion.

00:13:23.064 --> 00:13:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.303 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER:
Anti-American to do this.

00:13:26.303 --> 00:13:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: But then
two things happened

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.420 align:middle line:84%
in September, which forced
the Republicans' hand.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Colin Powell decided that he
was going to go on a book tour

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.070 align:middle line:84%
to redeem his
reputation and to lay

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
the blame on the
assets at the CIA

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.320 align:middle line:84%
for not telling him
that Iraqi exiles had

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.720 align:middle line:90%
lied about their intelligence.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
from my book that I

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:84%
was one of the people
who did warn him.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.600 align:middle line:84%
He gave an interview
with Barbara Walters

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:90%
on September 8th.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And on September 17th,
the Justice Department

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.790 align:middle line:84%
rubber-stamped the
decision that I

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.440 align:middle line:84%
should be sent to
Carswell Prison.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.370 align:middle line:90%
We know this from court papers.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:84%
On September 23rd, I
was hauled into court.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.030 align:middle line:84%
I was told by my
attorney that he

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.800 align:middle line:84%
had no idea why I was
going into court that day.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.140 align:middle line:84%
He said, I think the
judge is just tired

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:84%
and wants to know what's
happening in your case.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And he'd like us to try
to solve this thing.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he'd like us to
try to solve this thing.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And my uncle, who is an
attorney, Ted Lindauer,

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.970 align:middle line:84%
wonderful attorney, 40 years in
the University of Chicago Law

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:45.320 align:middle line:84%
School, a real fighter,
a Lindauer thing.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
Lindauer thing, yeah.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: He flew out
to New York to meet me.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.728 align:middle line:84%
He said, something's
going on here.

00:14:50.728 --> 00:14:52.300 align:middle line:90%
Something's wrong.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And we both knew that something
was going to happen that day.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I
had not been allowed

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.340 align:middle line:84%
to see the psychiatric
evaluations.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:05.020 align:middle line:84%
I showed up in court
and right before court,

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.790 align:middle line:84%
my attorney insisted right
until the last minute

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.210 align:middle line:90%
he had no idea why I was there.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And we get into court and
he says, oh, surprise.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.916 align:middle line:84%
They've decided they're
going to send you to prison.

00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:19.290 align:middle line:84%
They've decided
that you're going

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.930 align:middle line:84%
to be declared incompetent
to stand trial,

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.100 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be send you
to prison on Carswell Air Force

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:26.969 align:middle line:90%
Base.

00:15:26.969 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In Texas.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: In Texas.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:35.600 align:middle line:84%
For a in prison-- this is not
a hospital, this is a prison.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's a prison on
a military base, which

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:43.100 align:middle line:84%
is in the middle of a
war that they are losing.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:84%
These men have
friends who are dying.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.310 align:middle line:84%
They have men-- they have family
members, they have brothers,

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.530 align:middle line:84%
they have their neighbors who
are out there shedding blood

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.250 align:middle line:84%
in Iraq, who are getting
blown up in Iraq,

00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:01.090 align:middle line:84%
and you're telling them that
this Iraqi agent is going

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:02.710 align:middle line:84%
to be housed on
their military base.

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:04.126 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
that's what you were

00:16:04.126 --> 00:16:05.740 align:middle line:84%
known as in prison,
the Iraqi agent.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.074 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: The Iraqi agent.

00:16:07.074 --> 00:16:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And as far as they
were concerned,

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.434 align:middle line:84%
that probably meant
I was an Iraqi spy.

00:16:11.434 --> 00:16:12.850 align:middle line:84%
But as far as they
were concerned,

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:14.487 align:middle line:90%
I was the ultimate traitor--

00:16:14.487 --> 00:16:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: --to America.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.270 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know that
I'd warned about 9/11.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.510 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know that I tried
to save their lives by trying

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.470 align:middle line:84%
to tell Congress
not to go to war,

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't
need to go to war.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.058 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: They had no idea.

00:16:29.058 --> 00:16:32.180 align:middle line:84%
All they knew was that
this traitorous spy

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.820 align:middle line:84%
was being locked
up on their base.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And my life became-- anyway,
so I go into the courtroom

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and I have not been
warned anything.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.230 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what was coming.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:48.225 align:middle line:84%
And they threw the paper down
on the desk and we looked at it,

00:16:48.225 --> 00:16:51.530 align:middle line:90%
and I was like, holy God, what?

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:52.170 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And my life flashed
in front of my eyes.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And all of the good
things that I'd

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.420 align:middle line:84%
done, all of the hard
work that I'd done

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:84%
was erased by these
irresponsible nutcase

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:04.874 align:middle line:90%
psychology people--

00:17:04.874 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: -who wanted
to say that psychology

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.060 align:middle line:90%
decides reality.

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:10.937 align:middle line:90%
Talk about--

00:17:10.937 --> 00:17:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Instead of
external evidence and events?

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Instead of
external evidence and events.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And they felt that because
they were psychology people,

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:84%
they could eradicate
anything that

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:22.669 align:middle line:84%
got in the way of
their diagnosis.

00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But their diagnosis--

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Very frightening.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:26.591 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this
was actually only,

00:17:26.591 --> 00:17:28.760 align:middle line:84%
they were shills
playing out an agenda.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: They were shills
playing out an agenda.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.870 align:middle line:84%
They were prostituting
themselves

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.214 align:middle line:84%
to corrupt politicians
in Washington.

00:17:36.214 --> 00:17:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.296 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And they knew very
well that I wanted a trial.

00:17:39.296 --> 00:17:42.610 align:middle line:84%
I had very little sympathy,
to be perfectly honest,

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:43.950 align:middle line:90%
with psychology.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.880 align:middle line:84%
I do not believe that psychology
belongs in the courtroom

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.055 align:middle line:84%
unless you are a very
severe schizophrenic,

00:17:51.055 --> 00:17:56.080 align:middle line:84%
or you have been abused, like
if you're an abused child

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.120 align:middle line:84%
or abused woman who
has like a reason,

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:84%
like you're striking back
at an abusive relationship.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:06.826 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to hear that
you have manic depression

00:18:06.826 --> 00:18:08.200 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore,
you're not taking

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.650 align:middle line:84%
responsibility for
identity theft.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Or you're an embezzler
and oh, I can't help it.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.940 align:middle line:84%
I can't be held
responsible for my actions.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:90%
Garbage.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.720 align:middle line:84%
You most-- I would have no
sympathy for those people.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, the FBI
agent who arrested me later

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:84%
told me that he considered me
one of the most outstanding

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.140 align:middle line:84%
defendants that he'd
ever seen because I

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.240 align:middle line:90%
refused to play that game.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually
impressed because most people

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.680 align:middle line:84%
in the justice system,
most defendants

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:84%
will take a
psychiatric diagnosis

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:42.569 align:middle line:84%
as they're like, ha, ha, I
escaped, I beat the system.

00:18:42.569 --> 00:18:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And I
was like oh, no.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.263 align:middle line:84%
If you think you've got
evidence against me,

00:18:46.263 --> 00:18:49.126 align:middle line:84%
you have every
right to convict me.

00:18:49.126 --> 00:18:50.750 align:middle line:84%
You have the right
to sentence me and I

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.208 align:middle line:84%
better take
responsibility for what

00:18:52.208 --> 00:18:55.514 align:middle line:84%
I did, but I have every
right to challenge--

00:18:55.514 --> 00:18:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Stand trial.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: -stand trial and
challenge the accusations

00:18:59.080 --> 00:18:59.730 align:middle line:90%
against me.

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I have the right to show
why my actions do not

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.870 align:middle line:84%
rise to the level of
criminal behavior.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, that
wasn't going to happen.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.850 align:middle line:84%
You were not going to
have a chance to say that.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And not
only that, my judge

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.260 align:middle line:84%
was hearing Larry
Silverstein's case.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.750 align:middle line:84%
So you have the 9/11 component
and the profit motive,

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
the politicians who

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.560 align:middle line:84%
are terrified of
taking responsibility

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.590 align:middle line:84%
for their actions, and
you have little old me.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.780 align:middle line:84%
So they told me
right on the spot,

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.950 align:middle line:84%
they told me that if I-- well,
my uncle was an attorney.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:84%
He said, Susan, fire your
attorney immediately.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Fire Sam Talkin right
now or you're done.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.897 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be ruined.

00:19:38.897 --> 00:19:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did you do that?

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I tried to and they
said that if I fired Sam Talkin

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:84%
or if I demanded a
hearing to challenge

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:84%
the finding of incompetence
before I served prison time,

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.530 align:middle line:84%
then I would surrender
my bail immediately

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.050 align:middle line:84%
and I would lose
the right to have

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:04.490 align:middle line:84%
bail until the very
end of the proceedings.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.145 align:middle line:84%
And so, I would
not have any rights

00:20:07.145 --> 00:20:10.440 align:middle line:84%
that are normal under
these circumstances.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.950 align:middle line:90%
The law very clearly says--

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They wanted to
make sure Sam Talkin stayed

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.199 align:middle line:84%
in that position
of ineffectiveness.

00:20:15.199 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Absolutely.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.710 align:middle line:84%
They knew indifferent,
ineffective counsel.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, now what happens?

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So you're there in court
and you find this out.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.568 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I was
given-- they said

00:20:24.568 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:84%
that if I would agree to
self-surrender to prison,

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.910 align:middle line:84%
I would have 10 days to
get my affairs in order.

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Now I had not been
told that I might

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.280 align:middle line:84%
be going to prison that day, so
I had not made any arrangements

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:42.220 align:middle line:84%
for my home, my pets, my
family, my friends, you know.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:84%
I was horrified, terrorized
by the whole thing,

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.630 align:middle line:84%
but I had no choice but to
give them what they wanted.

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I would
have been lost.

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:57.082 align:middle line:84%
My uncle was like, OK, try
not to yell at the judge.

00:20:57.082 --> 00:20:58.540 align:middle line:84%
They were afraid
I was really going

00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.750 align:middle line:90%
to start screaming in court.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you,
your family is known.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.460 align:middle line:84%
You're scrappers and
fighters, and you'll

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.670 align:middle line:90%
say what's on your mind.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: You don't
mince any words.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:07.673 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I don't
mince any words.

00:21:07.673 --> 00:21:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you're talking about,
you know-- I'm an asset.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:84%
If they can do this to
me and I know my rights

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:20.140 align:middle line:84%
under the Constitution, I
know my historical rights.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:24.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, I am a highly-educated
white female.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:30.240 align:middle line:84%
I am not an inner city
youth drug addict.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a criminal, an
illiterate criminal.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.245 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have
a Master's degree

00:21:36.245 --> 00:21:37.745 align:middle line:84%
from the London
School of Economics.

00:21:37.745 --> 00:21:40.810 align:middle line:90%


00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:84%
My family has run this
country for hundreds of years.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.445 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
been in politics.

00:21:45.445 --> 00:21:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Been in politics.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they go way
back, way, way back.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.062 align:middle line:84%
Then again, you can find
six degrees of separation

00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:55.020 align:middle line:84%
for any family, I think,
in America these days.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.145 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's true.

00:21:56.145 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: But the point is is
that if they can do this to me,

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a fighter, I'm an
advocate, I'm an activist,

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.220 align:middle line:84%
then what are they going
to do to somebody else who

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:11.412 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have my skill at
beating, like an asset--

00:22:11.412 --> 00:22:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your
skill and knowledge,

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: My skill and
knowledge running a blockade.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:20.045 align:middle line:84%
An asset is trained to take
any circumstances that come

00:22:20.045 --> 00:22:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and to beat it and
run the blockade.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.530 align:middle line:90%
That's what we do.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.730 align:middle line:84%
We don't go in when it's
easy; we go in it's hard.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you, if
they can do this to me

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:35.360 align:middle line:84%
then the rest of you
are in serious trouble.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I went--
but I had no choice.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you got someone
to take care of your dogs.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I went
home that night.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.240 align:middle line:84%
I had 10 days to get
my affairs in order.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.446 align:middle line:84%
I self-surrendered to
Carswell Air Force Base.

00:22:52.446 --> 00:22:53.820 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
they said to me--

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they
pay your airfare?

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: The
US Marshals, yes.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: But when I got
to Carswell Air Force Base,

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.180 align:middle line:84%
they did an intake
psych evaluation

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.750 align:middle line:84%
like just when you first come
in and they talk to you for 15

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:12.050 align:middle line:84%
minutes, and they said the guy--
they have a real psychiatrist,

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:17.410 align:middle line:84%
who is trained to reject
incompetence defenses,

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.402 align:middle line:84%
and trained to--
the government-- you

00:23:20.402 --> 00:23:21.610 align:middle line:90%
have to understand something.

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:25.914 align:middle line:84%
Ordinarily, a government, a
Justice Department hates this.

00:23:25.914 --> 00:23:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: A
Justice Department--

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They want
you to stand trial.

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:30.719 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: -they want
you to stand trial.

00:23:30.719 --> 00:23:32.310 align:middle line:84%
They want to-- as
my second attorney,

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Brian Shaughnessy
said-- he was one

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.750 align:middle line:84%
of the chief prosecutors in
the court of Judge Sirica.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Judge Sirica, Maximum John
is what they called him.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.080 align:middle line:84%
He sentenced people to
huge sentences, he's like,

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.310 align:middle line:90%
bring me people to convict.

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:47.020 align:middle line:90%
I want to send them to jail.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.475 align:middle line:84%
Brian used to say, Susan, I
would be even madder than hell

00:23:50.475 --> 00:23:53.032 align:middle line:84%
if you were declared
incompetent.

00:23:53.032 --> 00:23:54.990 align:middle line:84%
He said, I would have
wanted you to stand trial

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.450 align:middle line:90%
so I could send you to prison.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:59.620 align:middle line:84%
He said, this is outrageous that
they said you were incompetent.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.930 align:middle line:84%
He said, this is an offense
against our legal system

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:03.800 align:middle line:84%
that they said you
are incompetent.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the first
psychiatrist to evaluate you,

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.410 align:middle line:84%
his job is to
basically declare you

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:14.240 align:middle line:84%
are competent to stand trial,
that's standard procedure.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.589 align:middle line:10%
>>LINDAUER: And so the
prison psychiatrist

00:24:16.589 --> 00:24:18.130 align:middle line:10%
took one look at me
and said, well, I

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.980 align:middle line:10%
can tell right now that these
reports about you are garbage.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:26.220 align:middle line:10%
He said, real people who are
incompetent are hallucinating.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.640 align:middle line:84%
They don't-- they see
something that isn't there.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.830 align:middle line:90%
They're hearing voices.

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:34.150 align:middle line:90%
You don't have any depression.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:35.720 align:middle line:90%
You're not weeping hysterically.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.050 align:middle line:90%
You're not out of control.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're pretty
pissed off at this point.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I'm pretty
pissed off at this point,

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:84%
but I was under
control because I

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.742 align:middle line:84%
was afraid of being belligerent
and like, you know, hitting.

00:24:44.742 --> 00:24:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you had
to try to keep it down.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.366 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I had to
be very controlled,

00:24:48.366 --> 00:24:52.150 align:middle line:84%
had to be very
controlled at all times.

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:52.670 align:middle line:90%
And I was.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:57.170 align:middle line:84%
I was exercising-- I was in
a state of terrible shock.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I can
tell right now,

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.230 align:middle line:84%
he said, this is your
attorney's doing.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.730 align:middle line:84%
He said, sometimes
attorneys when

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:07.710 align:middle line:84%
cases are very complicated, they
try to use a defense like this

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.600 align:middle line:84%
because they think
they can escape.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.400 align:middle line:84%
They're overworked,
they're overburdened.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.066 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah,
that would pretty much

00:25:13.066 --> 00:25:14.010 align:middle line:90%
describe my attorney.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:15.370 align:middle line:90%
He said, yeah, I thought so.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:17.494 align:middle line:84%
He said, well that doesn't
mean it's going to work,

00:25:17.494 --> 00:25:18.400 align:middle line:90%
you understand.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I
really expected to go home.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that my stupid
attorney had blown his strategy

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and that I was going to have
to serve this prison time,

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.070 align:middle line:84%
get out of jail, and go
right back to square one

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and start all over again and try
to find some money to-- raise

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:40.500 align:middle line:84%
some private funding to
hire a private attorney.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
should have happened.

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:48.440 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, my case
was loaded with politics.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And by this time, we were losing
the war in Iraq really badly.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Americans-- I mean, I
have to stop and say

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:59.100 align:middle line:84%
that American soldiers
and the Iraqi people

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.720 align:middle line:84%
were the greatest
victims of all.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And what I was suffering
at the start of this,

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.340 align:middle line:84%
J-- I had a wonderful
companion named JB Fields, who

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.309 align:middle line:84%
was himself retired
military, and he

00:26:12.309 --> 00:26:14.600 align:middle line:84%
used to say, Susan, if you
think what you are suffering

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.941 align:middle line:84%
is bad-- right up
until I go to prison.

00:26:16.941 --> 00:26:18.190 align:middle line:90%
Right up until I go to prison.

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.670 align:middle line:84%
When I was free
on bail, he said,

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:22.050 align:middle line:84%
"Susan, if you
think this is bad,

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:84%
just think what the American
soldiers are suffering.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's going to
lose his leg tonight.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's going to be
paralyzed tomorrow morning."

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Someone's
going to be killed.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.108 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Someone's
going to be killed,

00:26:31.108 --> 00:26:32.400 align:middle line:90%
and they did not deserve this.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.340 align:middle line:90%
They didn't get into this war.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.820 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones
who are suffering

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.410 align:middle line:90%
the most from these lies.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:40.690 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Think about the
Iraqi people whose houses

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:43.730 align:middle line:84%
are destroyed, whose schools
are destroyed, who've lost

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:45.260 align:middle line:90%
control of their country."

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:49.030 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Anything that you
feel that makes you feel angry,"

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:51.320 align:middle line:84%
he said, "don't feel
sorry for yourself."

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.190 align:middle line:90%
I loved him.

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:55.320 align:middle line:90%
He died-- he died of cancer.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.500 align:middle line:84%
But he refused to allow
me to feel self-pity.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Because he said, you need
to stand by your values.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.610 align:middle line:84%
He challenged me to
stand by my values

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.370 align:middle line:90%
and to take responsibility.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:08.410 align:middle line:90%
And I chose this.

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:09.940 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely did.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And to be perfectly honest
with you, the reason I still

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.170 align:middle line:84%
have a smile on
my face at all is

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:16.630 align:middle line:84%
because I believe I
did the right thing.

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.780 align:middle line:84%
I was ready to take any
consequences I had to take,

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.840 align:middle line:84%
but I never backed
down for a minute.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And I always stood up
for what I believed in.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:30.230 align:middle line:84%
But when I got into Carswell,
that's when it got scary

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and they began to rewrite
the history of my life.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:38.070 align:middle line:84%
They began to say that
I was quote, delusional.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.500 align:middle line:84%
That I was suffering from
grandiosity and severe

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.960 align:middle line:90%
paranoia.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I was like, well,
this is ridiculous.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This was Dr.
Voss and Dr. Peterson?

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Peterson,
Dr. Peterson of Carswell.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And
they freely admitted

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:56.860 align:middle line:84%
that they never saw any
evidence of schizophrenia

00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.960 align:middle line:84%
or hallucinations or hearing
voices, or any depression.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:07.670 align:middle line:84%
But I became terrorized because
even though they admitted

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.870 align:middle line:84%
there were no
psychiatric symptoms--

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:15.120 align:middle line:84%
and they freely said that--
they refused to release me

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.190 align:middle line:84%
from prison, and they filed
the papers with the court

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:20.732 align:middle line:84%
that I should be
detained indefinitely.

00:28:20.732 --> 00:28:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, first of all--

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Up to 10 years.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.958 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
normally when someone

00:28:24.958 --> 00:28:28.320 align:middle line:84%
goes into this place for a psych
evaluation, into this prison,

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.530 align:middle line:90%
it's 120 days.

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:31.585 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
actually six weeks.

00:28:31.585 --> 00:28:32.585 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Six weeks, OK.

00:28:32.585 --> 00:28:33.876 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Six to eight weeks.

00:28:33.876 --> 00:28:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason
it takes that long

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.840 align:middle line:84%
is because they've
got so many inmates,

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.960 align:middle line:84%
and they're processing them
as rapidly as they can,

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.050 align:middle line:90%
but they have to study people.

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:45.850 align:middle line:84%
People who were
there for 120 days

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:49.070 align:middle line:84%
are usually detox
cases, where they've

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:52.420 align:middle line:84%
been on some sort of
psychiatric drug or heroin

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:53.564 align:middle line:90%
or some kind of morphine.

00:28:53.564 --> 00:28:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you didn't
qualify under that category

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.510 align:middle line:84%
because you're very much
against drug taking.

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Absolutely.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So I had-- but they
have to detox somebody

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:03.830 align:middle line:84%
before they can find out
what they really are like,

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:06.970 align:middle line:84%
and whether they really are
incompetent to stand trial.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:11.496 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the only time that
you keep someone from 120 days.

00:29:11.496 --> 00:29:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you send them
right back to court.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they're going
to keep you up to 10 years.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: But they
demanded the right

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.010 align:middle line:84%
to detain me indefinitely
up to 10 years.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:21.950 align:middle line:84%
They told the court
that my belief

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:26.120 align:middle line:84%
in my experiences as an asset
were so deeply ingrained.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.712 align:middle line:90%


00:29:28.712 --> 00:29:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In your
memory and imagination.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: My
memory was so strong

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:39.180 align:middle line:84%
that it would require extra
hard work to break my spirit

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.340 align:middle line:84%
and to break me of my
belief in my identity.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:47.207 align:middle line:84%
And that it would take
several years, up to 10 years,

00:29:47.207 --> 00:29:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and that they would be
sure to let the court

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.640 align:middle line:84%
know when I had been convinced
that I no longer believed

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.190 align:middle line:84%
that I had warned about
9/11, and I no longer

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.890 align:middle line:84%
believed in the Iraqi
peace option, or--

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that you no longer
believed you were an asset.

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.891 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: --that
I'd been an asset.

00:29:59.891 --> 00:30:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Or that Richard Fuisz
or Paul Hoven existed.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.750 align:middle line:84%
At one point, it was so
crazy that they actually

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:08.620 align:middle line:84%
said that Richard Fuisz might
be a figment of my imagination.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you are
psychotic if you think that.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're like--
and they kind of

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:19.120 align:middle line:84%
tested me to see if I would back
down, and they were like, well,

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.580 align:middle line:90%
but can you prove they exist?

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.926 align:middle line:90%
I was like, yes, I can.

00:30:22.926 --> 00:30:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Can you prove Richard Fuisz
was a CIA asset, handler, a CIA

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.220 align:middle line:90%
operative?

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Yes, absolutely, because
the Justice Department

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:36.380 align:middle line:84%
had issued a finding of
his intelligence status

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.090 align:middle line:90%
in another case.

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And so the Justice
Department had laid out

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:45.630 align:middle line:84%
papers for a different
judge declaring

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:47.120 align:middle line:90%
that Richard Fuisz was a major--

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:47.911 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:30:47.911 --> 00:30:50.510 align:middle line:84%
The point is all the evidence
was there that you were clear

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:52.310 align:middle line:84%
on this, that all
the people existed,

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:55.219 align:middle line:84%
you said-- They weren't going
to take that for an answer,

00:30:55.219 --> 00:30:57.510 align:middle line:84%
and they were going to see
that you were hung out there

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:01.630 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of Texas
inside of a military base,

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.399 align:middle line:84%
sight unseen for as
long as possible.

00:31:03.399 --> 00:31:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Sight unseen
for as long as possible.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.023 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, so now
then they started

00:31:07.023 --> 00:31:10.900 align:middle line:10%
pushing for drugging you
to help you be released

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:15.264 align:middle line:10%
of these delusions, that you
are Susan Lindauer, a CIA asset.

00:31:15.264 --> 00:31:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:19.360 align:middle line:10%
What they said was that
treatment-- it was not

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.010 align:middle line:10%
enough to just
detain me, they had

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:24.930 align:middle line:10%
to chemically lobotomize me.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:28.550 align:middle line:10%
And I had seen them do this
to other women at Carswell.

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:31.630 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And I want you to talk
about this and share with us

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:33.780 align:middle line:10%
now this portion of it.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:39.730 align:middle line:84%
You had first-hand witness
to just horrific effects

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.009 align:middle line:84%
of these drugs, what it
did to these women's lives,

00:31:42.009 --> 00:31:43.800 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to tell
a few of those tales

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:48.260 align:middle line:84%
before we get back into the fact
you fought like crazy to not

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:49.300 align:middle line:90%
have that done to you.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.758 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: From
the very beginning

00:31:50.758 --> 00:31:54.370 align:middle line:84%
when I arrived at Carswell, I
saw that Carswell was overly

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:57.580 align:middle line:84%
drugging inmates who
were very healthy.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.910 align:middle line:84%
I watched these women
arrive at the prison.

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:05.200 align:middle line:84%
They were friendly, cooperative,
good communication skills.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.420 align:middle line:84%
The women on the
psych unit of Carswell

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.630 align:middle line:90%
had something in common.

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:11.109 align:middle line:90%
They were all middle class.

00:32:11.109 --> 00:32:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I know people
will be surprised to hear that.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: They were
not violent offenders.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
they end up there?

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.591 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how did these middle
class people end up there?

00:32:19.591 --> 00:32:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Most of
the women at Carswell

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:24.820 align:middle line:90%
were passive followers.

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Their husbands and
boyfriends had typically

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.200 align:middle line:90%
done some real crime.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.660 align:middle line:84%
The husband or boyfriend
tried to kill somebody.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.596 align:middle line:84%
The husband or boyfriend
was a bank robber.

00:32:34.596 --> 00:32:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or running drugs.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.928 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Or running drugs.

00:32:36.928 --> 00:32:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Most of them were very
simply drug cases.

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And the women were
very passive followers,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.300 align:middle line:84%
like they refused to testify
against their boyfriend,

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.600 align:middle line:84%
or they lied, they
outright lied and tried

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:56.740 align:middle line:84%
to create an alibi for them
called obstruction of justice.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:02.820 align:middle line:84%
So one of the women at Carswell
was given a 26 year term.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:05.470 align:middle line:90%
She was a great-grandmother.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:08.600 align:middle line:90%
And she was a black woman.

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.970 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these are black
people, you have to understand,

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:13.290 align:middle line:90%
they're black people.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And a black
great-grandmother whose

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:21.530 align:middle line:84%
granddaughter was
involved in drugs.

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And the great-grandmother
was taking care of the baby,

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:27.870 align:middle line:84%
and she said she
could not testify

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.310 align:middle line:84%
against her granddaughter
because it would cause

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:31.710 align:middle line:84%
too many problems,
and she needed

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.250 align:middle line:84%
to be there for that
child, who would otherwise

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:37.900 align:middle line:84%
go into the foster care
system and be destroyed.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So the judge in her
case said, well,

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.645 align:middle line:84%
since you won't
help society, I'm

00:33:41.645 --> 00:33:43.020 align:middle line:84%
going to make sure
that you never

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.370 align:middle line:84%
see your
great-granddaughter again.

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And so she gave her
a 26 year sentence.

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.760 align:middle line:90%
The woman was a teetotaler.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Had never used
drugs in her life.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Another woman who I knew, who
was on the psych unit with me,

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.090 align:middle line:84%
her boyfriend was
dealing in drugs,

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.960 align:middle line:84%
moving drugs from
Chicago to Washington.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.099 align:middle line:84%
And she was, herself,
a piano teacher.

00:34:08.099 --> 00:34:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, she never
used drugs at all.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:16.520 align:middle line:84%
But they tried to say she-- they
did declare her incompetent,

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.139 align:middle line:90%
and she was a piano teacher.

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:21.955 align:middle line:84%
They asked her what type
of music she taught.

00:34:21.955 --> 00:34:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
I teach everything.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.880 align:middle line:90%
I teach jazz, R&B.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.020 align:middle line:84%
They're like, oh,
that's black music.

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.929 align:middle line:90%
You can teach black music.

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well I graduated
from Howard University.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:36.139 align:middle line:84%
I'm a concert pianist level,
and I play Chopin and Mozart

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:37.580 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, now that's
another matter.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:44.880 align:middle line:84%
A black woman is not supposed
to play Chopin and Mozart.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.780 align:middle line:84%
They actually challenged
her competency.

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.337 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because she believed.

00:34:49.337 --> 00:34:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: They said
that she had delusions

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:52.977 align:middle line:90%
of being in the middle class.

00:34:52.977 --> 00:34:53.560 align:middle line:90%
And the idea--

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a classical
concert pianist.

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: That a black woman
would teach Chopin and Mozart.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:03.561 align:middle line:84%
The other was just the idea
that she could interpret it.

00:35:03.561 --> 00:35:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you've got to
remember, you're in Texas.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:07.226 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Yeah,
you're in Texas.

00:35:07.226 --> 00:35:09.380 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that you
could interpret it,

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.140 align:middle line:84%
that you would understand it,
that you could appreciate it.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And also, the sickening part was
that she taught white children.

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, you
think you're good enough

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:23.540 align:middle line:84%
to teach a white child, a
white seven-year-old how

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:24.760 align:middle line:90%
to play Mozart?

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.840 align:middle line:90%
You think that you're qualified?

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And so they declared
her--I mean,

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:31.890 align:middle line:84%
can you imagine the destruction
of this woman's psyche

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:34.700 align:middle line:84%
as they're saying, you know,
you think you're good enough

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.980 align:middle line:90%
to teach our children?

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And you don't teach-- and then
the third strike against her,

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.800 align:middle line:84%
which by this time
was just, I was just--

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:47.310 align:middle line:84%
I remember listening to this,
horrified just beyond, like,

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:50.900 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, they didn't-- oh no,
that she taught white children

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.560 align:middle line:90%
in her own home.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Because we all know that black
people can be servants and go

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.600 align:middle line:84%
to a white household
as a servant,

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.940 align:middle line:84%
but to expect a white child
to come into your neighborhood

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.650 align:middle line:84%
and to sit down
at your piano, you

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:06.010 align:middle line:84%
think your piano has enough
tuning for a white child?

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:07.770 align:middle line:84%
This is what we were
dealing with here.

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:09.640 align:middle line:90%
These people are nuts.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.250 align:middle line:90%
They are dangerous.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:11.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Neanderthals, really.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.433 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: --the psychiatrists.

00:36:13.433 --> 00:36:16.200 align:middle line:84%
But this was a real case,
this was a real woman,

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and she was declared
incompetent.

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:19.800 align:middle line:90%
She was declared incompetent.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And she was, let
me just add, she

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.780 align:middle line:84%
was a strong, confident,
motivated black woman

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:26.770 align:middle line:90%
with attitude.

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:28.690 align:middle line:90%
She did not swear or curse.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:30.500 align:middle line:84%
She was a middle
class black woman.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.110 align:middle line:90%
She was not ghetto.

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:35.160 align:middle line:84%
But you see, if she
had been ghetto,

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.295 align:middle line:84%
they would have said
well, you're black trash.

00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:38.100 align:middle line:90%
You're trash.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.720 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to
be trash, and you

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.011 align:middle line:84%
know you're supposed to be
trash and you're not uppity.

00:36:42.011 --> 00:36:46.590 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that she had
expectations of middle class

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.940 align:middle line:84%
values and she thought
she was good enough

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.160 align:middle line:84%
to be in the middle
class, oh my heavens.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.230 align:middle line:90%
I wept.

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:54.620 align:middle line:84%
I was like-- but the
thing is, these people,

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.800 align:middle line:90%
it was like-- it was terrifying.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can tell
you these stories.

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And another beautiful,
beautiful, young black woman,

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:06.670 align:middle line:90%
a Spelman College student.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Spelman is a historically black
women's college in Atlanta,

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:14.660 align:middle line:84%
and she'd been in the
top 10% of her class.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:17.200 align:middle line:84%
When she arrived, she was
like a sorority sister:

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:22.430 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, exuberant,
confident, joyful.

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the guards
said, she reads the newspaper.

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:30.250 align:middle line:84%
A black woman who
reads the newspaper.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:34.660 align:middle line:84%
We were told never to
request a newspaper.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:35.770 align:middle line:90%
She did.

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:36.770 align:middle line:90%
She made the mistake.

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:39.860 align:middle line:84%
She was-- I guess she was
just doing what she does,

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:43.260 align:middle line:84%
but the idea that a black
woman would be aware

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.589 align:middle line:90%
of contemporary--

00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Current events.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Current events.

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:49.980 align:middle line:90%
She'd have ideas.

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:53.180 align:middle line:90%
She'd be literate.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And this was not
a violent woman.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.856 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is
very frightening to them.

00:37:56.856 --> 00:37:59.348 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Very, very, very
frightening to them and to us.

00:37:59.348 --> 00:38:01.181 align:middle line:84%
Because what they did
to this woman was they

00:38:01.181 --> 00:38:07.420 align:middle line:84%
demanded-- she was compliant,
and this was her mistake.

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.810 align:middle line:84%
She had been taught to be a
good girl, to be obedient,

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and if they told her to
do something, she did it.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.880 align:middle line:90%
So she agreed.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.510 align:middle line:84%
She allowed them to drug
her; she did not fight it.

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And she agreed to
take whatever drugs

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:24.170 align:middle line:84%
and they doped her
to the gills so

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:27.160 align:middle line:84%
that she could
not speak anymore.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.840 align:middle line:90%
She blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.269 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, don't know, blah.

00:38:32.269 --> 00:38:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
happened to her mind?

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: She drooled.

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:38.520 align:middle line:84%
She would cry at night, and
that was-- and she would weep,

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.890 align:middle line:84%
and we'd hear her
sobbing in the hallways.

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:47.420 align:middle line:84%
But she lost the ability
to physically read a book,

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.490 align:middle line:90%
to write anything.

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:52.490 align:middle line:84%
She could not hold
a cup to drink,

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:54.850 align:middle line:84%
to lift-- the act of
lifting a cup to your mouth.

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:56.891 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She didn't have
the motor coordination?

00:38:56.891 --> 00:38:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: You'd
spill it all over you.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Motor coordination was gone.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Many times we saw black
women particularly

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:11.480 align:middle line:84%
who were middle class,
who had pretensions,

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.410 align:middle line:90%
who were middle class.

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:16.340 align:middle line:84%
This was not pretentious,
this was a fact.

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.020 align:middle line:90%
These were--

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But why-- and they
went after the black women more

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:21.592 align:middle line:90%
than the other inmates?

00:39:21.592 --> 00:39:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: More
than anybody else,

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:24.457 align:middle line:90%
they wanted to degrade them.

00:39:24.457 --> 00:39:26.290 align:middle line:84%
It was all about
degradation and punishment.

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:28.331 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now I want
to get into another part

00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:29.430 align:middle line:90%
of the degradation.

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:32.620 align:middle line:90%
You had a chaplain there.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.490 align:middle line:90%
Ratzinger just retired.

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I think we kind of know
where this is going.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.910 align:middle line:84%
What happened with the
chaplains and the inmates?

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And also, what happened
with the psychiatric staff?

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Carswell had
a very high rate of rape.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
realize as a prisoner,

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:56.600 align:middle line:84%
if a guard or Catholic
chaplain decides

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.540 align:middle line:84%
they want to do something
to you, if you fight back,

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.120 align:middle line:84%
you get an assault
charge and you

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:03.750 align:middle line:84%
can add five years
to your sentence.

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:05.179 align:middle line:90%
You don't have any rights.

00:40:05.179 --> 00:40:06.970 align:middle line:84%
If they want to do
anything to you, if they

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:08.720 align:middle line:84%
want to stick their
hands down your pants,

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.860 align:middle line:84%
if they want to
sodomized you, you

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.880 align:middle line:84%
don't talk back to
them when they do it.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:14.730 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:18.810 align:middle line:84%
If you do, you are get--
that's an assault charge.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so--

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: You will get
a federal assault charge

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.920 align:middle line:90%
adding years to your sentence.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So this, repeatedly,
women at Carswell

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.587 align:middle line:84%
have been raped by
these guards repeatedly.

00:40:28.587 --> 00:40:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's mostly the
guards and the chaplain,

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:32.310 align:middle line:84%
who have-- they had to get
rid of them didn't they?

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: A gynecologist
was raping women.

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
in fact, I remember

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:38.180 align:middle line:84%
reading in the book where
you said the women were

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:41.280 align:middle line:84%
terrified to even go to the
doctor or the gynecologist

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.240 align:middle line:84%
or the chaplain, and
they wouldn't go alone.

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: They
wouldn't go alone.

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
did a buddy system

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:46.630 align:middle line:84%
because they knew what
would happen to them.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:48.588 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: They knew
what was going to happen.

00:40:48.588 --> 00:40:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And guards, I remember
when I was there,

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:55.400 align:middle line:84%
guards would say to
younger women than myself,

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.600 align:middle line:84%
but attractive
young inmates, you

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.360 align:middle line:84%
know, hey, I could
give you cigarettes

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.430 align:middle line:90%
if you'll trade favors with me.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:06.160 align:middle line:90%
You know, I could protect you.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I could bring you
extra commissary

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:12.730 align:middle line:90%
if you'll do stuff with me.

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So meanwhile, you're
being told by, I don't remember

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:21.250 align:middle line:84%
whether it was Voss or
whether it was Peterson,

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:24.160 align:middle line:84%
when they were telling
you, we don't care whether

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.470 align:middle line:84%
you're-- basically, we
don't care about the reality

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:27.060 align:middle line:90%
of your case.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.090 align:middle line:90%
It's your word against ours.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:29.950 align:middle line:84%
We're doctors, who are they
going to believe here, right?

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: That's right.

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.920 align:middle line:90%
That is exactly what they said.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.820 align:middle line:84%
They said that psychiatry
decides what is reality.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.130 align:middle line:90%
I remember saying, no way.

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:39.880 align:middle line:90%
External events decide it.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.710 align:middle line:90%
I have witnesses.

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Over and over and
over again my defense

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.000 align:middle line:84%
was that I have witnesses
who would provide

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.520 align:middle line:84%
independent confirmation of
who I was and what I had done.

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I demand the
right to call them into court.

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:52.970 align:middle line:90%
That is the law.

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:54.960 align:middle line:84%
You are required
to obey the law.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem
was the Patriot Act.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Because I was detained
on the Patriot Act,

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:02.094 align:middle line:84%
I did not automatically
have the right to a hearing,

00:42:02.094 --> 00:42:03.510 align:middle line:84%
because under the
Patriot Act, you

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:07.720 align:middle line:84%
can be-- you can be detained
indefinitely with no trial.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.360 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
give you a hearing.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So, what I found--

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: They don't
even have to give you

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:12.630 align:middle line:90%
a hearing under the Patriot Act.

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is just
almost incomprehensible

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:16.860 align:middle line:90%
that this can happen.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes, yes.

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:20.429 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, Judge
Mukasey, at what--

00:42:20.429 --> 00:42:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Sorry, sorry.

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:23.110 align:middle line:90%
Let me just tell you.

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I was, even then, the
first-- I arrived October 3,

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:33.120 align:middle line:84%
a day that is burned into
my consciousness forever.

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And I was pretty much OK
until right before Christmas.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And right before
Christmas, I was

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:43.064 align:middle line:84%
summoned to an internal
medication hearing.

00:42:43.064 --> 00:42:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's
what I wanted to get to.

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And that's
when I discovered

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.820 align:middle line:84%
that the government had--
all the bad things that I

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:53.760 align:middle line:84%
was seeing happen to
all these other women,

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.824 align:middle line:84%
that they wanted
to do this to me.

00:42:56.824 --> 00:42:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Even though I didn't
suffer from any symptoms.

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.540 align:middle line:84%
I had shown no
problems with guards.

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.044 align:middle line:90%
I was very low key.

00:43:03.044 --> 00:43:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I read the
comments from the guards.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.065 align:middle line:90%
You have all the documentation.

00:43:06.065 --> 00:43:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: The
guards said I was

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.210 align:middle line:84%
cooperative, smiling,
good eye contact.

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:17.190 align:middle line:84%
No behavioral problems,
good hygiene, not a problem.

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:18.460 align:middle line:90%
I was there.

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, I'm
obviously locked in prison.

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I have to have a decent
attitude about this.

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:28.060 align:middle line:84%
I was not going to be a
troublemaker in prison.

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I just did not have-- I
avoided the psych staff.

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:34.630 align:middle line:90%
I refused to play the game.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:37.720 align:middle line:84%
We had something
called team meetings.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Every inmate has them, every
prisoner in the federal system.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And once a month,
you go and you have

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.696 align:middle line:84%
like a minute with
all the staff to say,

00:43:45.696 --> 00:43:47.070 align:middle line:84%
you know, what's
going on, do you

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:49.060 align:middle line:84%
have any concerns,
any questions?

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm a
political prisoner.

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:54.190 align:middle line:84%
I demand my right to
a trial and hearing.

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:56.760 align:middle line:84%
You have no right to
be holding me here.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And I am on record telling
you that I expect--

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:04.279 align:middle line:84%
that I will never give up
until I get my day in court,

00:44:04.279 --> 00:44:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and you can put that
in your reports.

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:08.360 align:middle line:90%
I refuse to give up my rights.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what
you do, you're

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.680 align:middle line:90%
never going to change my mind.

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was summoned
to this medication hearing,

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:23.630 align:middle line:84%
they said they wanted to
dope me with Haldol, Ativan,

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:25.326 align:middle line:90%
and Prozac.

00:44:25.326 --> 00:44:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, that's very
interesting because Haldol,

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.080 align:middle line:90%
that's for delusions.

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.160 align:middle line:84%
I have already proven
that my story is correct.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.490 align:middle line:84%
You, the head psychiatrist,
has interviewed my witnesses.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:40.060 align:middle line:84%
He has confirmed
the 9/11 warnings.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:43.700 align:middle line:84%
He's confirmed that I worked
as an asset with Richard Fuisz.

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And I've already met
the burden of proof

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:51.410 align:middle line:84%
that I need to make at this
stage, and I have no intention,

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:52.610 align:middle line:90%
I will fight you.

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, Prozac,
that's an extraordinary drug

00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:00.090 align:middle line:84%
to give somebody who
suffers no depression.

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I said, never in my life
have I suffered depression.

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:06.480 align:middle line:84%
I am a very active,
motivated person.

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I said Ativan
for stress, I said,

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.940 align:middle line:84%
outside of prison I
don't suffer stress,

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:15.360 align:middle line:84%
so I have no
intention of taking--

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.340 align:middle line:84%
the only reason I suffer
from stress in prison

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:24.710 align:middle line:84%
is because you've detained me
without due process of law.

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I understand.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:29.270 align:middle line:84%
As I was reading your book,
at each turn of events--

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:31.384 align:middle line:84%
each horrible turn
of events, of course,

00:45:31.384 --> 00:45:33.550 align:middle line:84%
you put yourself in the
person's shoes thinking god,

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:36.470 align:middle line:84%
how would I-- I would have
been so much worse than you.

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:39.250 align:middle line:84%
I would not have been
able to keep my cool.

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I was
terrified out of my mind.

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you--

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:45.225 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: I so scared.

00:45:45.225 --> 00:45:48.110 align:middle line:90%


00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:53.940 align:middle line:84%
I was like my stress
level, my anxiety level--

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.650 align:middle line:84%
again, when you're
first in prison,

00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:58.160 align:middle line:90%
that in itself is a shock.

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.010 align:middle line:84%
I'd never been in prison in my
life, and never expected to.

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:03.760 align:middle line:90%
I was the good guys.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.710 align:middle line:84%
We were the ones who
opposed violence.

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:08.910 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones who are
stopping terrorism.

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:14.030 align:middle line:84%
I had built up a
long reputation.

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:15.910 align:middle line:90%
I had an extensive background.

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:17.740 align:middle line:90%
Well, we call the bona fides.

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And I had tremendous-- I had
the best in the industry.

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Nobody had done
the thing-- that's

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:26.450 align:middle line:84%
the other thing you don't
really understand even

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:30.330 align:middle line:84%
listening to all this,
nobody had my bona fides.

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:33.526 align:middle line:84%
Nobody working in
anti-terrorism.

00:46:33.526 --> 00:46:34.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, these
people, they were

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.694 align:middle line:84%
running around
pretending to be me.

00:46:36.694 --> 00:46:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.994 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: But I
dealt with Hezbollah.

00:46:38.994 --> 00:46:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I dealt
with Saddam Hussein.

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:44.090 align:middle line:90%
I dealt with Qaddafi.

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:47.490 align:middle line:84%
I dealt with the first Osama
bin Laden investigation.

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you-- the point is,
you knew what you were doing.

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:middle line:90%
You're the real deal.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I'm the real deal,
and these other people are just

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:55.370 align:middle line:90%
fakes and posers.

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:57.304 align:middle line:90%
And so you're going to judge me?

00:46:57.304 --> 00:46:59.470 align:middle line:84%
You're going to tell me
that I didn't do a good job?

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:01.520 align:middle line:90%
I can dance circles around you.

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's like I'm like
an Olympic performer

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and you're giving
me a nine or a 10.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:10.344 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not like some
little high school gymnast.

00:47:10.344 --> 00:47:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:11.975 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: No, huh-uh.

00:47:11.975 --> 00:47:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you knew that.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:15.475 align:middle line:84%
You had the advantage of that
experience, that knowledge,

00:47:15.475 --> 00:47:17.940 align:middle line:84%
making it doubly insulting that
you were in this situation,

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:21.080 align:middle line:84%
but how did you manage to
fight off being drugged?

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they kept coming at you.

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, they came at you
for what, five years?

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Back, and back, and
back, trying to drug

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:31.110 align:middle line:90%
you to erase that delusion.

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Ordinarily when--
the really scary part of it

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:40.390 align:middle line:84%
was that the prison knew that
ordinarily they would win.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:43.070 align:middle line:84%
I had seen other
women who didn't

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:45.130 align:middle line:84%
want to be drugged
either, and I could

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:46.800 align:middle line:84%
see the consequences
of what they

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.520 align:middle line:84%
suffered every day
of their lives.

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:50.710 align:middle line:90%
This is torture.

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:53.530 align:middle line:84%
This is worse than
water boarding.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:55.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's not even a joke.

00:47:55.500 --> 00:48:01.110 align:middle line:84%
These people are-- these
are non-violent offenders.

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they had been
violent offenders,

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:04.660 align:middle line:84%
if they were like
attacking the guards

00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:07.920 align:middle line:84%
or attacking other inmates,
you could make an argument.

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:11.460 align:middle line:84%
But these were women
who were very passive,

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:14.370 align:middle line:84%
who were traditionally
in their own lives

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:16.030 align:middle line:90%
very, very, very passive.

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if they're
on this drug cocktail--

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: -letting their
boyfriends run their lives.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And now if they're on
this drug cocktail,

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.780 align:middle line:84%
basically, they're
totally incapacitated

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:23.989 align:middle line:90%
and they sleep all day.

00:48:23.989 --> 00:48:26.030 align:middle line:84%
The system doesn't have
to deal with them at all.

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:27.947 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: They slept
20 hours a day or more.

00:48:27.947 --> 00:48:30.113 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they can't--
they can feed themselves.

00:48:30.113 --> 00:48:31.450 align:middle line:90%
They can't bathe themselves.

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:32.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: They
had to be washed--

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're not a
problem to the system.

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: They
had to wash them--

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:37.920 align:middle line:84%
they had to be taken by
guards or other inmates

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:41.130 align:middle line:84%
to the showers, stripped
naked and washed.

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:43.090 align:middle line:84%
They could not wash
their own hair.

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:48.630 align:middle line:84%
I had one friend who grieves
me to this day named Courtney,

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:52.685 align:middle line:84%
and she was so proud
that she took a chair

00:48:52.685 --> 00:48:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and she kept it-- she could
no longer carry the chair,

00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.950 align:middle line:84%
but she kept a chair
in the shower rooms

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:01.560 align:middle line:90%
so that she could just move it.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was hard for her to move
it from one stall to another.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.830 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't even
do that anymore.

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But didn't you
guys help each other out?

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: We did, we
helped each other out.

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:11.720 align:middle line:84%
But nobody would move
the chair because it

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:14.970 align:middle line:84%
was like, she had made a
commitment to us that she

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:16.220 align:middle line:90%
would bathe herself every day.

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.886 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No matter
how drugged she was.

00:49:17.886 --> 00:49:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: No matter how
badly she was drugged.

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:21.950 align:middle line:90%
And she could no longer speak.

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:23.660 align:middle line:90%
She could no longer write.

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:27.280 align:middle line:84%
She could no longer
communicate at all.

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.790 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:31.649 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're getting a
picture, not a pretty picture,

00:49:31.649 --> 00:49:32.940 align:middle line:90%
of what it's like inside there.

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Very terrifying.

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Very terrifying.

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.278 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you
have to go back.

00:49:35.278 --> 00:49:38.690 align:middle line:84%
You ultimately have
to go-- you were

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:41.110 align:middle line:84%
ultimately released,
but only 7 months later.

00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Well, hold on.

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've got about
10 minutes left in the show,

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:43.990 align:middle line:90%
so let's go into it.

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: OK, I was
locked up for a year.

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I refused to
be voluntarily drugged,

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:56.320 align:middle line:84%
I demanded a hearing
and they held me

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.410 align:middle line:84%
for several-- they
ended up holding me

00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:01.740 align:middle line:84%
at Carswell for seven
months, and then moving me

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:04.130 align:middle line:84%
to the Metropolitan
Correctional Center

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:09.440 align:middle line:84%
in Manhattan, which
was considered a worse

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:14.820 align:middle line:84%
prison because you were on
lockdown 18 hours a day,

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.770 align:middle line:90%
18 to 20 hours a day.

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Which meant that the rest of
the time I was stuck on the top

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:24.930 align:middle line:84%
bunk not able to go
outside, not able to have

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:26.930 align:middle line:90%
any physical exercise.

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:28.640 align:middle line:90%
The food was terrible.

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:31.440 align:middle line:84%
It was considered one of the
worst prisons in the system,

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.920 align:middle line:90%
to be perfectly honest with you.

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:35.210 align:middle line:90%
MCC is considered dreadful.

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I was so relieved
to be out of Carswell

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:41.992 align:middle line:84%
that I wrote the judge begging
the judge not to send me back.

00:50:41.992 --> 00:50:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
mean, I think you

00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:45.720 align:middle line:84%
felt it was forward
progress of some kind.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.905 align:middle line:84%
At least you were getting
closer to the sight

00:50:47.905 --> 00:50:49.230 align:middle line:90%
of where you could go to court.

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Absolutely.

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And my beloved companion,
this is what saved to me.

00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:57.950 align:middle line:84%
My beloved companion
JB Fields, who

00:50:57.950 --> 00:51:03.120 align:middle line:84%
died before my case ever ended,
but he was so terrified of what

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:08.450 align:middle line:84%
was happening he took
my case to the blogs.

00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was one
of the first big cases

00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:13.740 align:middle line:84%
in what we know now as the
blogosphere, was your case.

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Was my case.

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And until that point,
the corporate media

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:20.840 align:middle line:84%
had decided what was
important for our society.

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And now the internet
media was just

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:26.870 align:middle line:84%
beginning-- this was in
2006, and so a lot has

00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:28.270 align:middle line:84%
happened in the
past seven years.

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:30.780 align:middle line:90%
We forget how far we've come.

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:32.644 align:middle line:84%
But the internet
was just beginning

00:51:32.644 --> 00:51:33.560 align:middle line:90%
to discover its power.

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and also, I
want to just interject something

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:36.030 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:37.830 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed a fellow
named Richard Dolan, who's

00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:39.954 align:middle line:84%
written a book about this,
this was included in it.

00:51:39.954 --> 00:51:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard this from
other situations and sources

00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:46.030 align:middle line:84%
up close that when it
comes to the primary media

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:48.810 align:middle line:84%
in this country,
CIA is intimately

00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:51.290 align:middle line:84%
involved at either a
publishing or editorial level.

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:53.560 align:middle line:84%
They will determine if
a story makes it out

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.350 align:middle line:90%
and how it will be presented.

00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:58.250 align:middle line:84%
The New York Times
had your story,

00:51:58.250 --> 00:52:02.140 align:middle line:84%
a junior reporter
had your story down.

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Had confirmations
of the 9/11 warnings--

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The New York Times
would not let that surface.

00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So you end up-- the thing
that really, I mean,

00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:10.240 align:middle line:90%
I had to laugh out loud.

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So you finally do get a
hearing at one point in this,

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and they're saying she's
incompetent to stand trial.

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:20.190 align:middle line:84%
We have to drug the woman
because of her delusion

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:23.370 align:middle line:84%
she was a CIA asset and
worked on all these cases.

00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And the judge said,
essentially, sirs,

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:30.050 align:middle line:84%
are you aware of what she
is being accused of and why?

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, she
is an asset and we're

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:36.420 align:middle line:84%
saying she's even
a traitorous asset.

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:38.399 align:middle line:84%
And this whole thing
was absolutely insane.

00:52:38.399 --> 00:52:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: That's right.

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that's
all the prosecution had

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:43.170 align:middle line:84%
was just anything to
shut you up no matter

00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:44.950 align:middle line:90%
how stupid they appeared.

00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And this is how
crazy the psychiatry industry

00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:51.510 align:middle line:84%
was, and it is a money
making, profit oriented

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:53.195 align:middle line:90%
business in the courts.

00:52:53.195 --> 00:52:56.540 align:middle line:84%
They actually-- you had the
Justice Department filing

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.470 align:middle line:84%
criminal charges
against me, which

00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:01.570 align:middle line:84%
depended on my relationship
with the diplomats

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:02.952 align:middle line:90%
at the Iraqi embassy.

00:53:02.952 --> 00:53:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, there
couldn't be any charges.

00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:06.076 align:middle line:84%
And then these
crazy psychiatrists

00:53:06.076 --> 00:53:07.885 align:middle line:90%
came in and said that I was--

00:53:07.885 --> 00:53:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was making it up.

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: --inventing
the phony relationships

00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:13.147 align:middle line:90%
with the Iraqi embassy.

00:53:13.147 --> 00:53:14.855 align:middle line:84%
And the judge was
like, do you understand

00:53:14.855 --> 00:53:18.610 align:middle line:84%
that if this didn't occur,
there can't be an indictment?

00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, OK.

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And the
judge was brilliant.

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And let me just say one
thing about Judge Mukasey

00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:27.260 align:middle line:90%
because he finally saved me.

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.040 align:middle line:90%
He emerged as my hero.

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.080 align:middle line:90%
The blogs were fighting for me.

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.890 align:middle line:84%
That blogs were challenging
it, they were questioning it.

00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And Judge Mukasey looked at the
whole thing and he was like,

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:38.950 align:middle line:90%
this is a disaster.

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:41.390 align:middle line:84%
We just want to get this
case out of the courtroom.

00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Judge Mukasey was a great judge,
a legal straight arrow who

00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:52.280 align:middle line:84%
saw the dangers of the
Patriot Act in his courtroom,

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and he realized that my
case made a lot of bad law.

00:53:56.150 --> 00:54:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very
weak public defender,

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.820 align:middle line:84%
who was not capable of fighting
for all these other issues.

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And if my case would
have set precedents

00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:11.300 align:middle line:84%
that other cases around the
country would have used.

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And so Judge Mukasey had
a legitimate grievance

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.814 align:middle line:90%
against the Patriot Act itself.

00:54:16.814 --> 00:54:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And he
wanted-- I do believe

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:22.100 align:middle line:84%
that he wanted to get my
case out of his courtroom

00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:25.140 align:middle line:84%
and to avoid a trial
because he wanted

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:27.980 align:middle line:84%
to safeguard the
system that he loved.

00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And this shows the
horror of my experience

00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and the nightmare of how
viciously I was abused.

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And except for the
honesty, the integrity

00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:45.220 align:middle line:84%
of Judge Mukasey-- you know, I
say in my book the old Thomas

00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Jefferson quote, "One man of
courage makes a majority."

00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And it takes one
person to stand up.

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Never doubt it for a minute.

00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.810 align:middle line:84%
It takes one person to stand
up and say this is intolerable.

00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:00.310 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
put up with this.

00:55:00.310 --> 00:55:02.226 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to let
you get away with this.

00:55:02.226 --> 00:55:06.970 align:middle line:84%
One person can change
everything, and it always does.

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you-- and so-- don't--
I hope that you will listen

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.570 align:middle line:84%
to my story and be horrified
of the Patriot Act,

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:16.260 align:middle line:90%
but don't give up your activism.

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
ultimately, he had to weigh,

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:20.500 align:middle line:90%
Mukasey had to weigh everything.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:22.860 align:middle line:84%
He had to look at what
was going to happen

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:26.850 align:middle line:84%
if you did stand trial,
which was pretty horrific.

00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And what was going to
happen if he just said,

00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:31.105 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm going with it.

00:55:31.105 --> 00:55:34.440 align:middle line:84%
If she's incompetent then
she can't stand trial,

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.810 align:middle line:90%
and then the epilogue is--

00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And on
the last day, and so

00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:42.140 align:middle line:84%
it was that on the very
last day of his tenure

00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:45.890 align:middle line:84%
as a federal judge, I was
the very last decision

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:51.080 align:middle line:84%
of his illustrious career,
and he handed down a blow

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:55.690 align:middle line:84%
to the prosecution that they
would not be allowed to drug me

00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:56.760 align:middle line:90%
after all.

00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:59.790 align:middle line:90%
And it was a shocker.

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:04.230 align:middle line:84%
My attorney and me-- I was
convinced that ordinarily they

00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:06.210 align:middle line:84%
would give up and
they'd go along

00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:08.470 align:middle line:84%
with whatever the
prosecution wanted to do.

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:12.264 align:middle line:84%
And he stood up
for me, and again--

00:56:12.264 --> 00:56:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He wouldn't
let them drug you.

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: So that's
how we avoided it.

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:16.988 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To avoid
it, but to get it over

00:56:16.988 --> 00:56:18.610 align:middle line:84%
with it was like you
have to-- you had

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:22.460 align:middle line:84%
to accept his ruling
of incompetence

00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:25.520 align:middle line:84%
to avoid being drugged, and
also to avoid standing trial,

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.195 align:middle line:90%
and it was over.

00:56:26.195 --> 00:56:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: It was like
splitting the baby in half.

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So you had to live with
it, but you were out.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: But I was out.

00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now we only
have a minute or two left.

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:35.330 align:middle line:90%
After all of this, Susan--

00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I am glad that
I stood up for my values.

00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:40.190 align:middle line:90%
It's always worth it.

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:44.520 align:middle line:10%
We are in a fight for
our country right now.

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:46.580 align:middle line:10%
This is a battle that
we have got to win.

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:47.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:50.560 align:middle line:10%
>>LINDAUER: I am still-- I've
been recovering from the past,

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.630 align:middle line:10%
I've had a very
intense 12 years,

00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:55.380 align:middle line:10%
and for the past six months,
I've been kind of laying low.

00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:57.120 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not gone.

00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:00.890 align:middle line:84%
My energy is building back
up, and I just needed a break,

00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:03.580 align:middle line:84%
but I'm here and I'm going
to be out there fighting

00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:04.270 align:middle line:90%
for everybody.

00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And also, I want everyone
to know diplomacy

00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:08.377 align:middle line:90%
can always achieve results.

00:57:08.377 --> 00:57:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's another
part to this, too,

00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:11.150 align:middle line:90%
and that is spiritual.

00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:13.030 align:middle line:84%
You're a deeply
spiritual individual.

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:16.114 align:middle line:84%
You're a very
intuitive individual.

00:57:16.114 --> 00:57:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes.

00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you said
off camera, the one thing

00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:23.130 align:middle line:84%
you want is to be able
to bring all that back

00:57:23.130 --> 00:57:25.290 align:middle line:90%
to its innocent state.

00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:27.500 align:middle line:84%
After all this happened,
it's like a fourth degree

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:28.630 align:middle line:90%
burn to the soul.

00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Yes, it's a fourth
degree burn to the soul.

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to be
a toxic personality.

00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I want to be-- I want
to use my life from now

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.000 align:middle line:90%
on for positive things.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that the work that
I'd done before was positive,

00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:43.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to keep going
back in that direction.

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And I want the
Republicans to know

00:57:45.090 --> 00:57:47.897 align:middle line:84%
and the Justice Department
to know you didn't beat me.

00:57:47.897 --> 00:57:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, they didn't.

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: You didn't beat me.

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're alive and well
and back and more than sane.

00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:53.181 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: That's right.

00:57:53.181 --> 00:57:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Susan, thank you so
much for sharing your story.

00:57:55.770 --> 00:57:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Just absolutely amazing.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.795 align:middle line:84%
And an amazingly
courageous woman you are.

00:57:58.795 --> 00:58:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Thank
you, very much.

00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you
haven't, by chance,

00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:04.560 align:middle line:84%
seen our first interview, it
is a must view in my opinion.

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.370 align:middle line:84%
You can find it in
the Gaiam TV library.

00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, to delve
deeper into Susan's case,

00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:11.300 align:middle line:84%
you can find a copy of her
book "Extreme Prejudice"

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:13.280 align:middle line:90%
at Amazon and other booksellers.

00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:15.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a harsh lesson on the
dangers of the Patriot Act

00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and government collusion with
the psychiatric industry,

00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:19.530 align:middle line:90%
as you've just heard.

00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
