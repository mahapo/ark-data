00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL SCHOON: For
the last 800 years,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.360 align:middle line:90%
we've had periods of stability.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And we know them, cultural
stability, economic stability,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.040 align:middle line:90%
political stability.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.150 align:middle line:84%
These ages are
always interrupted

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.700 align:middle line:90%
by waves of rising prices.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.010 align:middle line:84%
At the deepest
metaphysical sense,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.760 align:middle line:90%
power is only one source, it.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:84%
But no matter how much power
or how little power you have,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.830 align:middle line:90%
no one's in control.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And that makes everybody
nervous, even the ones

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.190 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of power.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And I learned personally
tremendous lessons

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:48.420 align:middle line:84%
that there is an underlying
current that you can depend on.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like you are on the deck
of a ship in tremendous storms.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And the power of the ship goes
up, and all you see is sky.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And then the wave breaks,
and all you see is the water.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.090 align:middle line:84%
It says you don't know
what's going to happen.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.260 align:middle line:90%
You're not in control.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
you're freaked out.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Give me today.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.470 align:middle line:90%
Give me tomorrow.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.270 align:middle line:90%
Just be.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.968 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.968 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I'm sure it
has not escaped your attention

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.730 align:middle line:10%
that the price of
food, even services,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:10%
has been rising pretty rapidly.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.240 align:middle line:10%
Packages are smaller
while prices are rising,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.670 align:middle line:10%
and it's not going to stop.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:90%
So how did we end up here?

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.760 align:middle line:90%
And what is the end game?

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Darryl Schoon is
back with us to dive

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.030 align:middle line:84%
deep into where we are
historically in the economy

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.650 align:middle line:84%
because these are
cycles, and you've

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.930 align:middle line:84%
done a beautiful job
of delineating them.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And you've also done a beautiful
job of actually predicting

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:90%
patterns and future events too.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So because things are so crazy,
I mean, simple things like--

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every day, I'm
finding about new things.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.970 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
California, if you

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.040 align:middle line:84%
want to put some cleansing
tablets in your swimming pool,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.350 align:middle line:90%
they just doubled in price.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Why did they just double
in price in California?

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Because during COVID,
everybody started

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.540 align:middle line:90%
building swimming pools.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.390 align:middle line:84%
The manufacturers
start taking advantage.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:84%
It's the craziest little
things to all the food

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.830 align:middle line:84%
in the markets, just shocking
rises in prices and shortages.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Even Trader Joe's,
certain things that are

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.350 align:middle line:90%
staples you can't get anymore.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Our world has changed
in the last two years.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So I want to talk
to you about it.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, let's
talk about the endgame.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Did you want to make a
comment before we go on?

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: I want to
make a comment about--

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not the
endgame, but the reset.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: But this
goes into that.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.850 align:middle line:10%
>>DARRYL: And this is a source
that in 1996, a professor wrote

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.340 align:middle line:10%
a book called-- his name
was David Hackett Fischer

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.570 align:middle line:10%
and he wrote a book called "The
Great Wave: Price Revolutions

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.140 align:middle line:10%
and the Rhythm of History."

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And he pointed out that
for the last 800 years,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.840 align:middle line:90%
we've had periods of stability.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.590 align:middle line:10%
And we know them, cultural
stability, economic stability,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.800 align:middle line:10%
political stability.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And we know them by names
like the Middle Ages,

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:84%
the Renaissance, the
Age of Enlightenment.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And he calls the current age the
Age of Victorian Equilibrium,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.600 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.433 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right now?

00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Right now.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Victorian equilibrium?

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: And he said
these ages are always

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.330 align:middle line:84%
interrupted by waves
of rising prices that

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:84%
arise out of the prosperity
and reach a peak.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And that rise is accompanied
by increasing disasters,

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.210 align:middle line:84%
upsettlements, things
going sideways.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And they culminate when
that great wave breaks.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And that brings that
current age to a collapse

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:84%
of cultural,
political, economic,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and religious
institutions, which

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.370 align:middle line:90%
makes way for another age.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I was going to
say, isn't that by necessity?

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.197 align:middle line:84%
I mean, isn't that what happens
with everything even in nature?

00:03:47.197 --> 00:03:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: Well, and we
are a part of nature.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: It doesn't matter how
reified or extreme our thinking

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.840 align:middle line:84%
has gotten, where we've
dissociated from not only

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.920 align:middle line:84%
nature but from the
life itself, we--

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Regina, if anything, these last
200 years or the last 2,000

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.430 align:middle line:84%
years has culminated
in us becoming

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.200 align:middle line:90%
dissociated from who we are.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't know who
we are, all right?

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.490 align:middle line:84%
My joke used to be--
in fact, my new book

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:84%
"Docking To the
Mothership," all right,

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.019 align:middle line:90%
that's going to come out.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.140 align:middle line:84%
The genesis of it was for years,
I was going to write a book

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and I was going to say, my
battle against mental illness.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.340 align:middle line:84%
I think, oh, Darryl
was mentally insane.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with him?

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.448 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say, I was
living this life

00:04:28.448 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and I was working hard,
just like everybody else.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, where's the
mental illness?

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And the implication,
what I'm going to say

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.690 align:middle line:84%
is just because you're
ambulatory does not

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.300 align:middle line:90%
mean you're mentally healthy.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:90%
You're just functioning.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.820 align:middle line:84%
What we call mental illness
is at the level of where

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.500 align:middle line:90%
you're no longer ambulatory.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.600 align:middle line:84%
You're a danger to
yourself and others.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.190 align:middle line:84%
That's when you fall
off the other end.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.600 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is what
we have on this planet

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.720 align:middle line:84%
as a collective consciousness
is an extreme case

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:84%
of mental dissociation
from source.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is about
to be rectified,

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.340 align:middle line:84%
which is not exactly
where I thought

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.807 align:middle line:90%
I was going to take this.

00:05:10.807 --> 00:05:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We always
leave it open for Darryl

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:90%
to go where he needs to go.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: Now, David
Hackett Fischer

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.370 align:middle line:84%
pointed out these rising
waves of inflation

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.090 align:middle line:84%
that interrupt and
take down every epic.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.460 align:middle line:84%
In 1896, he said
inflation started

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
rising during the Age of
Victorian Equilibrium.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.770 align:middle line:84%
It takes anywhere from
80 to 160 years to crest.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.220 align:middle line:84%
In 1996, he wrote
his book and he said,

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.370 align:middle line:84%
we are approaching the
final stages, perhaps

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.810 align:middle line:84%
the last and critical stage
before this all comes down.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.970 align:middle line:90%
Homelessness, drug use, family--

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mass insanity.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: --mass insanity,
religious fervor,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.940 align:middle line:84%
rising prices, political
uncertainty, all these things.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.820 align:middle line:90%
So he said it, all right?

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.020 align:middle line:90%
And I read it.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And what we do, Regina,
at least what I do

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.690 align:middle line:84%
is I notice that we all have
bigger pictures of reality.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.950 align:middle line:90%
Atheists do.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:90%
Jehovah Witnesses do.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Muslims do.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.360 align:middle line:90%
Born-again Christians do.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
We all have our little
big picture, all right?

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And the data that we
take out of there,

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.400 align:middle line:84%
we pick and choose so it
fits with our picture.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm like everybody
else, all right?

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Except my picture radically
changed in the Haight-Ashbury.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.790 align:middle line:84%
I went from law school,
studying torts, property,

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:90%
all this kind of stuff.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.620 align:middle line:84%
A year later, I'm
running the food section

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.690 align:middle line:90%
of the Avalon Ballroom.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.050 align:middle line:90%
I am taking acid.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm smoking up.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm with a bunch
of hippies a year

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.530 align:middle line:90%
before I thought were crazy.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:84%
A year later, I can no
longer call them crazy

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.620 align:middle line:90%
because I was one of them.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And the worldview
that came in, which

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.070 align:middle line:84%
is very rudimentary
then, very rudimentary,

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.860 align:middle line:84%
the Age of Aquarius,
peace, love,

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.930 align:middle line:90%
let your love light shine.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.540 align:middle line:84%
I can't say that I
really believed that then

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:84%
because I was so recently
out of law school.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.880 align:middle line:84%
55 years later,
Regina, I'm hard.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You've got it.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.300 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: I'm hard.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:16.902 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're a hippy.

00:07:16.902 --> 00:07:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Peace, love, and joy.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And David Hackett
Fischer, what he said

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.250 align:middle line:84%
coincided exactly
with the foundation

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.250 align:middle line:90%
that we were given then.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce talked
about a Golden Age

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.160 align:middle line:84%
after severe Earth
changes, all right?

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're seeing is the
culmination of not just the Age

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.080 align:middle line:84%
of Victorian Equilibrium,
but my belief

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.450 align:middle line:84%
is we're seeing a
balancing of our universe,

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.420 align:middle line:84%
of our particular part of
the universe that has never

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.610 align:middle line:84%
happened before, a
balancing between the two

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:84%
polarities that we recognize
as yin-yang, male-female,

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, and reason
and emotion, all right?

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
longer a paradigm has

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.130 align:middle line:84%
been in effect, the deeper
and the more chaotic

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.950 align:middle line:90%
the disruption, all right?

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
I'm particularly

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.420 align:middle line:84%
lucky at this moment
because my attachment to it

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:20.460 align:middle line:84%
was uprooted by being
in the Haight-Ashbury.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.230 align:middle line:84%
If I had stayed in
law school, I would

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.950 align:middle line:84%
be really worried about the law
firm that I was associated with

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and what was going to
happen to my huge 401(k).

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:31.900 align:middle line:90%
I'd be looking at it.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.549 align:middle line:84%
My third wife, fourth wife,
I'd have a lot of stuff

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.110 align:middle line:90%
out there, all right?

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.309 align:middle line:84%
But it got ripped
away at that time.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:43.929 align:middle line:84%
Because I like to
have things, it

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:47.140 align:middle line:84%
got periodically ripped away
along the way, all right?

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And I learned personally
tremendous lessons,

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:55.140 align:middle line:84%
that there is an
underlying current that you

00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:90%
can depend on that gives you--

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.080 align:middle line:90%
And I hope that the people--

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.580 align:middle line:84%
because people who
are hearing this,

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.900 align:middle line:84%
it depends, of course,
on who they are.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And for those who don't
know or can't relate

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
to what I am talking to you
about an underlying current,

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.080 align:middle line:84%
I hope that they
find it in this time.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that they
haven't found it before

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean they won't
find it, because it's

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:84%
very often the
latest to the parties

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.022 align:middle line:84%
are the hardest, take it with
the most belief and fervor.

00:09:30.022 --> 00:09:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And this really, to me,
gets into the subject

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.510 align:middle line:84%
that's also bandied about
very loosely called ascension.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.990 align:middle line:84%
We have all kinds of
ascension communities, right?

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it seems paralleling
what you were talking about,

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.410 align:middle line:84%
that what ascension
is, is we understand

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and we intuitively
as a species know

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.720 align:middle line:84%
we do have this brilliant
time to look forward to,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.790 align:middle line:84%
but we have a little bit of poo
to wade through to get there.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that ascension
is the letting go

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.070 align:middle line:84%
of our attachment to
material everything,

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.070 align:middle line:84%
letting go to an extent
of the material world

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and moving closer
in relationship,

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:16.790 align:middle line:84%
as you said to start, with our
true self, with the cosmos,

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.250 align:middle line:84%
with our Earth, and
with each other, going

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.970 align:middle line:84%
more towards spirit and
less toward materialism.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.410 align:middle line:90%
I think that is ascension.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: That is true.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And one extreme of ascension,
it is the spiritual drive

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.390 align:middle line:90%
to get of the material plane.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.570 align:middle line:84%
The association of
this with desire,

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.430 align:middle line:84%
with fear, with greed,
with all these things,

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.070 align:middle line:90%
and our sin and rise above it.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But desire is
what creates everything.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Exactly.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You got
to still have that.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Exactly.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.590 align:middle line:84%
But the ascension,
I'll get above it.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The whole thing.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: --because you
just want to get out

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.830 align:middle line:90%
of here, which I understand.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, at the
other end, ascension

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.370 align:middle line:84%
has a completely
different meaning,

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.310 align:middle line:84%
though it's just as
radical a shift, all right?

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And to me, this came
in just very recently,

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.320 align:middle line:84%
last week, the
concept, a new look

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:16.730 align:middle line:84%
at what I had called the
middle way, all right?

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:84%
The middle way between the
extreme spiritual denial

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.160 align:middle line:84%
of the physical plane,
the physical body,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.493 align:middle line:90%
and the physical reality.

00:11:23.493 --> 00:11:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which we can't do.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.145 align:middle line:90%
We're earthlings.

00:11:25.145 --> 00:11:25.945 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: No.

00:11:25.945 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:84%
But most people's feeling
here, they beat themselves up.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.120 align:middle line:84%
They go and they become
assholes to other people,

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:84%
like this, that little
prude look on their face,

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:42.500 align:middle line:84%
piety because they se people
absolutely indulging in it.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the truth is pain is a
part of the process of duality.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And one of the fallbacks
from pain is pleasure.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:90%
I know this.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I know that if I didn't
like food so much,

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.290 align:middle line:84%
I would have been a junkie
in my early 20s, all right?

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't like
downers, so God

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.690 align:middle line:84%
set that as I wasn't
going to go on that path,

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and forced me
because I was going

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.590 align:middle line:90%
to eat myself to-- force me up.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:07.645 align:middle line:90%
I can.

00:12:07.645 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:90%
I was the beneficiary of that.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:14.990 align:middle line:84%
But you can't escape
from suffering

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.210 align:middle line:90%
by denial or pleasure.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.010 align:middle line:84%
You can, but that's not what
the universe wants you to do.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.540 align:middle line:90%
No, the universe does not.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And the universe does
not want you to go back.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I am among the lucky few, if
I may say so, that I got back.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.156 align:middle line:84%
And I talked about this on
our last program, Regina.

00:12:35.156 --> 00:12:38.330 align:middle line:84%
When I was in prison,
a long prison sentence,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.370 align:middle line:90%
I meditated like--

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Dealing
hallucinogenics and stuff,

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.480 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Well, other stuff.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Other stuff too, yeah.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: It was by dharma.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And I heard something that
said, because I had learned

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.650 align:middle line:84%
to flip with
controlling reality,

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.960 align:middle line:90%
I retired by keeping my mind on.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm retired, 1976--

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Eye on the prize.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: --I got it, all right?

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And then I ran through
the course in miracles

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and it said, turn
it over, let go.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:84%
I lost everything,
went into poverty,

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.430 align:middle line:90%
flipped back, got it again.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And then having it again the
third time, I read these words.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Your use of thought to
control your reality

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:20.190 align:middle line:84%
is an inappropriate use of
this power at this time.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's direct.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: It was right for me.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Meant for you.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.328 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: From a
book that had been

00:13:26.328 --> 00:13:28.470 align:middle line:84%
written sixty years
before, all right,

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.210 align:middle line:84%
"Thinking & Destiny,"
channel book.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:35.700 align:middle line:90%
It said, you are using thought--

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
it said because at this
time, much of what you learn

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.550 align:middle line:84%
comes through
adversity, and you are

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.790 align:middle line:84%
using thought to keep
these situations away

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.300 align:middle line:90%
from you that you need.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:53.297 align:middle line:84%
Well, at that time, I was living
in a $4,500 monthly 1981--

00:13:53.297 --> 00:13:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, living it large.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: --and
live in Mill Valley.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.980 align:middle line:90%
And there it is.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.143 align:middle line:90%
Holy smokes, I couldn't deny it.

00:14:01.143 --> 00:14:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you recognize
it in that moment?

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Of course, I did.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.257 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:14:05.257 --> 00:14:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: But I
wasn't ready because I

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.420 align:middle line:84%
had let go before I
lost everything twice.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Now it's telling me
third time's the charm.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.040 align:middle line:90%
So I threw the I Ching again.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.780 align:middle line:90%
It said, no.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:84%
I closed my eyes, asked
myself, can I use affirmations?

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.400 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.360 align:middle line:84%
One year later, 10-year
prison sentence.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Out of that prison
sentence, I got a period

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.850 align:middle line:90%
of temporary enlightenment.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.850 align:middle line:84%
The words time of the
vulture came to me

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:37.710 align:middle line:84%
that set a foundation for
why I'm even here today.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I can say
that why I am talking to you

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.760 align:middle line:84%
or why you are talking to me
came from me being in prison.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Then I would not have
said, sign me up.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:50.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, oh, sure.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:51.870 align:middle line:90%
Hey, let me do that.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:90%
I want to go further.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'll do that.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:55.470 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.690 align:middle line:90%
You can't, all right?

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And what came out of
it was the middle way.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.346 align:middle line:90%
And what I was--

00:15:05.346 --> 00:15:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I was told this years
ago in a trance thing,

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.290 align:middle line:84%
that I have explored
the material levels.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.090 align:middle line:90%
And I have.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You have.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.450 align:middle line:90%
You really did it up.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: I wrote in my novel--

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:84%
I said, I've had
so much that I know

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.740 align:middle line:90%
what indigestion is, all right?

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Of what people want
right, all right?

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.190 align:middle line:90%
And I've had it.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And I got that sense
of enlightenment.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.010 align:middle line:90%
Not even asking the question.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.250 align:middle line:90%
And then it went away.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:42.020 align:middle line:84%
I wondered-- I wondered for
decades, why did you go away?

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Like I was there.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And what I was told
last week in another--

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.280 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.010 align:middle line:90%
it came to me that I was--

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm not supposed to be here
in the extreme material

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.013 align:middle line:90%
nor there in extreme--

00:15:59.013 --> 00:16:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In extreme denial.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: --extreme spiritual.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, which is denial
of the material completely.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: Yeah,
totally at one back.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: I'm supposed
to walk the middle way.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: The middle way.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:12.700 align:middle line:90%
Walk here knowing that.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: And that's what it is.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:15.825 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:16:15.825 --> 00:16:18.030 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, we're
not in the middle way.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:21.060 align:middle line:84%
We've gone way too far
over into the extreme world

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.490 align:middle line:84%
of materialism, our
minds being bent

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.500 align:middle line:84%
and dragged around like
puppy dogs with algorithms.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.300 align:middle line:90%
You need this.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Here is the next this.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you to have this?

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's putting us--
that's put us in a bind,

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.962 align:middle line:90%
in the bind we're in now.

00:16:32.962 --> 00:16:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about cyclically also.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's partly our own
buy-in and decisions

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.090 align:middle line:90%
that have made this cycle.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:84%
But first, before that, I want
to talk about the Great Reset.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, it started out and it came
to my vision maybe, oh, 10, 12

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.830 align:middle line:90%
years ago when people--

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.080 align:middle line:84%
groups of people had
boards they were watching

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and they were going to buy up
the dinar and the Vietnamese--

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:56.860 align:middle line:90%
what is it there?

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:57.660 align:middle line:90%
Whatever the--

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: The dong.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dong, right?

00:16:59.040 --> 00:16:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Yeah.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dong and so forth.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:00.510 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: As opposed
to the American dong.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
the American dong.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Vietnamese dong.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.089 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And make millions
and millions of dollars.

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:07.881 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, that
sounds kind of fun.

00:17:07.881 --> 00:17:10.020 align:middle line:84%
So I bought a couple of
little sheets of dinar

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.023 align:middle line:84%
and put it away to
watch as a game.

00:17:12.023 --> 00:17:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course,
nothing happened.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.579 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's been 10, 12
years, something like that.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:17.347 align:middle line:84%
But that was what
reset was called then.

00:17:17.347 --> 00:17:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Very good.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:18.980 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.599 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's talk-- and
now it's in mainstream news.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:22.560 align:middle line:90%
What the heck?

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.079 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's using the word reset.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: You know, Regina,
I made my reputation

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.910 align:middle line:84%
in the field of talking
about gold and money.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:90%
And started in 2007.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:84%
I got so popular out
there that, in 2011, I

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.792 align:middle line:84%
had 62 pages on a Google
search for my name.

00:17:43.792 --> 00:17:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a lot.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: OK?

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm down to one now because
I don't write anymore.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But 62 pages, that's
a lot, all right?

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And my audience is
that extreme material.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:90%
All male.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.560 align:middle line:90%
I spoke in Europe, Australia.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.800 align:middle line:90%
All guys-- there's a few women--

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.620 align:middle line:84%
asking hard questions
about a hard reality

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.560 align:middle line:84%
that I was able to give
some answers to, OK?

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I saw this thing
coming from the reset.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.730 align:middle line:90%
Now, why?

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.650 align:middle line:84%
We all are-- none of us
are in control of this.

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:18.450 align:middle line:90%
None of us.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.610 align:middle line:90%
Some may have more power.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.190 align:middle line:84%
The person who has the least
amount of power physically

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:24.660 align:middle line:84%
is the person who's
a quadriplegic

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.062 align:middle line:84%
and can't even move
the physical body.

00:18:27.062 --> 00:18:29.270 align:middle line:84%
There are those in this game
who have a lot of power.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.160 align:middle line:90%
They have money.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.080 align:middle line:90%
They have influence.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.220 align:middle line:84%
People phone them when
they want things done.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:84%
But no matter how much power
or how little power you have,

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.200 align:middle line:90%
no one's in control.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And that makes everybody
nervous, even the ones

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.530 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of power.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:47.900 align:middle line:84%
I used to say, the difference
between credit and money

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
is like the difference
between power and control.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.490 align:middle line:90%
They're not the same.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And to learn what the
difference comes at a cost.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us the difference
between power and control.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: Power is
something you accrue here

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.140 align:middle line:90%
on the physical plane.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.810 align:middle line:84%
But at the deepest
metaphysical sense,

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.330 align:middle line:90%
power is only one source.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.500 align:middle line:90%
It, all right?

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And you could have temporal
power here in a certain area

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.140 align:middle line:90%
but you don't tap that.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.450 align:middle line:84%
You can have very little
temporal power here

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.240 align:middle line:84%
but a tremendous amount of
metaphysical power there.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And never the twain
shall meet, perhaps.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:84%
But what I wanted to say that
in context of the Great Reset,

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.910 align:middle line:84%
it explains why the
idea of reset came.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:34.390 align:middle line:84%
The people who I was writing
to or wrote about money,

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:38.500 align:middle line:84%
they knew our money was a
fraud, that it no longer had

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.800 align:middle line:90%
anything of value and that is--

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.360 align:middle line:84%
we're one year away from the
1,000 year anniversary of paper

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.950 align:middle line:90%
money, which came to China.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Why did China come
up with paper money?

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.635 align:middle line:84%
Well, they invented paper
and they invented ink.

00:19:52.635 --> 00:19:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
there's your money.

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.177 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: And the government
liked power, all right?

00:19:56.177 --> 00:19:57.120 align:middle line:90%
So they gave it out.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.625 align:middle line:84%
They cut it down to a back
into 47% copper to the paper

00:20:01.625 --> 00:20:02.500 align:middle line:90%
and put it out there.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And 50 years later,
they spent more money,

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.860 align:middle line:90%
they went broke, all right?

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Over the next 600 years, five
Chinese dynasties went down.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.740 align:middle line:84%
They outlawed it
in China in 1661.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And 30 years later,
Bank of England

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.240 align:middle line:84%
came up but not so
much as fiat money

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.720 align:middle line:84%
itself, which it was, but
as the mechanism of debt.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.410 align:middle line:84%
That's the difference
between fiat in Asia and fiat

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:24.550 align:middle line:90%
that we have now.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:28.120 align:middle line:84%
fiat now is not so much money
is that it's conveyor of debt

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.390 align:middle line:84%
because the bankers
control it here, all right?

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I'm saying
is the idea that

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.680 align:middle line:84%
knowing that our
very money system is

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.440 align:middle line:84%
somebody using it to
benefit themselves

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:90%
and not you is disturbing.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: And so couple
that with the idea

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.430 align:middle line:84%
that you're not in
control, all right?

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.260 align:middle line:90%
You know you're not in control.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:50.880 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say this to the
boys about the Great Reset.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.190 align:middle line:90%
And I may not be true.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.480 align:middle line:90%
But I certainly believe it.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is?

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.390 align:middle line:10%
>>DARRYL: The boys who
have the power, who

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:10%
are behind fiat, who
are sitting there

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.280 align:middle line:10%
having these phone
calls right now,

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.650 align:middle line:10%
they're not in control either.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that they
have more power than us--

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:15.837 align:middle line:84%
the relative
power-- doesn't mean

00:21:15.837 --> 00:21:17.920 align:middle line:84%
they're in control even
though it looks like that.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I
was in prison, I

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:23.020 align:middle line:84%
noticed one thing about being
in prison-- a lot of rumors.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And why-- and I came to
the conclusion there's

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.752 align:middle line:84%
a lot of rumors because
people have no power.

00:21:27.752 --> 00:21:29.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was at
the highest level.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.842 align:middle line:84%
People were used
to being in power.

00:21:31.842 --> 00:21:33.550 align:middle line:84%
They're used to having
things, all right?

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Now they were-- and oh,
we're being moved over there.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.750 align:middle line:84%
A function of the
loss of power--

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:90%
of control.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.580 align:middle line:84%
A function of the
loss of control.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:49.960 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of the reset,
the people who have the power

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.160 align:middle line:90%
are not in control.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And I know they thought--
that was part of the

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:90%
why they're going down now.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.450 align:middle line:84%
They had so much
power they began

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.310 align:middle line:90%
to believe they're in control.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:02.620 align:middle line:90%
That's the delusion of power.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.160 align:middle line:84%
The illusion of temporal power
is the longer you have it,

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.920 align:middle line:84%
the more you think you're in
control, which is a fatal flaw,

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:10.720 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, when they started
moving off of gold,

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.650 align:middle line:90%
they went to SDRs in the '70s.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.390 align:middle line:90%
That was going to solve it.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.200 align:middle line:90%
It didn't.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain SDRs.

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: That is a deposit--

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:24.447 align:middle line:84%
received depository
of gold, all right?

00:22:24.447 --> 00:22:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And they were going to use
that to float it around

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:30.280 align:middle line:84%
in their game to have
a quasi system backed

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.630 align:middle line:84%
by gold because officially
they pulled it out.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.580 align:middle line:90%
Didn't work.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Regina, what they're doing today
isn't going to work either.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:41.870 align:middle line:90%


00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:43.680 align:middle line:90%
They don't have any answers.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.243 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's
going off the rails.

00:22:46.243 --> 00:22:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It seems
to me like it's

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:53.260 align:middle line:84%
just a desperate land grab right
now for any kind of profits

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.755 align:middle line:90%
anybody can make anywhere.

00:22:54.755 --> 00:22:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: Anything,
anything, anything.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:56.720 align:middle line:84%
People are feeling
that desperation

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.970 align:middle line:90%
of the games going, all right?

00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:59.840 align:middle line:90%
So it's happening, all right?

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I heard the reset
coming real early from the crowd

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.520 align:middle line:90%
that I talked to.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, and the
crowd that I talked to

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.010 align:middle line:84%
has gotten small
because they figured out

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:12.900 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not one of them.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.180 align:middle line:84%
There are few people out
there in the money thing

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.520 align:middle line:90%
that still listen to me.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.260 align:middle line:84%
They listened to
me in the beginning

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:23.700 align:middle line:84%
because I was able to explain
the game of money in a way

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.310 align:middle line:84%
better than most could explain
it and what was going on.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You do.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:27.953 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: All right?

00:23:27.953 --> 00:23:29.090 align:middle line:90%
But because I'm a--

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:30.053 align:middle line:90%
I got this other side.

00:23:30.053 --> 00:23:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hippy thing.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:31.320 align:middle line:90%
Love thing.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.295 align:middle line:84%
You got this love
thing going on.

00:23:32.295 --> 00:23:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: I got this love
thing going in the background

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.370 align:middle line:90%
and about God.

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.350 align:middle line:84%
People used to say,
hippies were out--

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.600 align:middle line:90%
drugs, sex, and rock and roll.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.220 align:middle line:90%


00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Worked for you.

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Granted.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.200 align:middle line:90%
But they forgot about God.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.510 align:middle line:84%
That was the deepest
thing of all.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.032 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we went-- that's
why we started meditating.

00:23:51.032 --> 00:23:52.740 align:middle line:84%
That's why the thing
about India came in.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Trying to
develop a connection.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: Because
we knew it wasn't--

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.270 align:middle line:84%
that God had nothing
to do with belief.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.260 align:middle line:90%
You could believe this.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.135 align:middle line:84%
You could believe-- you
can believe anything.

00:24:00.135 --> 00:24:02.970 align:middle line:84%
But when it came to God,
when it came to spirit,

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:03.880 align:middle line:90%
it was experience.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: And we knew that
the experience was real

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
was an illusion.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:11.400 align:middle line:84%
So I want to get back
to one thing you just

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.450 align:middle line:90%
mentioned a moment ago.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.550 align:middle line:84%
When you were in
prison, it was--

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:17.055 align:middle line:84%
because you had a population
of powerless people.

00:24:17.055 --> 00:24:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Powerless people.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So rumors everywhere.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Rumor.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:19.800 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I
was interviewing--

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Internet.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:90%
Social media.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:24.145 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was interviewing
Carl Calleman recently

00:24:24.145 --> 00:24:26.730 align:middle line:90%
who does Mayan cosmology.

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:27.840 align:middle line:90%
He's quite good at it.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Right, right, right.

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:30.418 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he goes through
the waves of it, right?

00:24:30.418 --> 00:24:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And he said, in this
particular wave,

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:35.100 align:middle line:84%
we've now passed the halfway
mark on a dissenting wave.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.680 align:middle line:84%
400 years, mini cycles
of consciousness.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And what happens at that
point is when conspiracy

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.330 align:middle line:90%
takes over societies.

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And once conspiracy is solidly
embedded in the culture,

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:50.310 align:middle line:84%
that is the beginning of
the end of the culture.

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:52.440 align:middle line:90%
Because mistrust is rampant.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.298 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: And you know,
there was another book.

00:24:55.298 --> 00:24:56.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you've seen it.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.390 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The
Fourth Turning."

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Steve Bannon and I
both have read it.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Steve Bannon
absolutely believes it.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So do I. I had a different
conclusion than he did.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.660 align:middle line:90%
And I watched it.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like people
reading the Bible.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.590 align:middle line:84%
You know how people come
to different conclusions

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:14.798 align:middle line:90%
about what's going to happen.

00:25:14.798 --> 00:25:16.657 align:middle line:84%
And what they said
in there-- they

00:25:16.657 --> 00:25:18.240 align:middle line:84%
wrote-- also it came
out the same year

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.532 align:middle line:90%
that David Hackett Fischer did.

00:25:19.532 --> 00:25:20.490 align:middle line:90%
1996.

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And they said, after the--
sometime in the new millennium

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:27.690 align:middle line:84%
a great crises is going to
overtake the nation as it

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:29.730 align:middle line:90%
has done three times before.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
The first one was the
Revolutionary War.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.400 align:middle line:90%
They come in 70, 80 years.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.130 align:middle line:90%
The next one was a Civil War.

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:37.560 align:middle line:84%
The third one was the Twin
disasters-- twin crises

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.990 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Depression
and World War II.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And they said right up
ahead we'll get another one.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Cycles.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:43.690 align:middle line:90%
You're into cycles?

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: OK.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And they said, there's going
to be a tremendous mistrust

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.652 align:middle line:90%
of official institutions--

00:25:49.652 --> 00:25:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where we are.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:50.730 align:middle line:90%
That's where we are.

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: There
could be a Civil War.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.657 align:middle line:84%
All these things are
going to happen, it said.

00:25:54.657 --> 00:25:56.250 align:middle line:84%
But then it said
there is going to--

00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:00.150 align:middle line:84%
out of this-- it's going to
last for probably 20 years.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Out of this is going to come a
new realization, an atonement

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and recognition of recent
mistakes, and a coming

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:14.100 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're not
come together yet.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.260 align:middle line:84%
But I want to talk about why
the belief about the reset

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.910 align:middle line:90%
is and the loss of control.

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: In 1985--

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.760 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.440 align:middle line:84%
In 1985, there was a
book that came out.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.240 align:middle line:90%
It was channeled.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:90%
Series of seven books.

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:34.520 align:middle line:84%
From '84 I was in prison
for seven years time in.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.490 align:middle line:90%
10 year sentence, time in, 7.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Seven books were channeled.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:40.690 align:middle line:90%
One for each of my years.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.943 align:middle line:84%
I read those books
with a, probably, focus

00:26:42.943 --> 00:26:44.610 align:middle line:84%
that I wouldn't have
had on the outside.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What were they?

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.473 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: It was called
"Right Use of Will."

00:26:47.473 --> 00:26:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh God, what
an incredible subject.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: OK?

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: And
"Right Use of Will."

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And what it said
in the introduction

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:58.750 align:middle line:84%
is that we know that many
of you believe that spirit

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:01.100 align:middle line:90%
is a part of divine spirit.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And only if your
will behaved the way

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.450 align:middle line:84%
you would want it
to do you would have

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.040 align:middle line:90%
what you would want to have.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you, your will
is a part of divine will

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.490 align:middle line:84%
as much as your spirit is a
part of the divine spirit.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:17.250 align:middle line:84%
The only problem with your
will is how you've treated it.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Your will manifests to
you as your emotions.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
evolution of life,

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.550 align:middle line:84%
many emotions have
been triggered

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:33.050 align:middle line:84%
in response that are anger,
rage, fear, abandonment, loss

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.180 align:middle line:90%
that you don't want to feel.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:36.990 align:middle line:90%
And so you denied these.

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:41.250 align:middle line:84%
It says, let me tell you, those
feelings are a part of you.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you continue to
deny them, they will die,

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:47.250 align:middle line:90%
and so will you.

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:50.160 align:middle line:84%
He said-- God said,
I've given you

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.720 align:middle line:84%
your wills to show you the way,
to care and to protect for you.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.630 align:middle line:84%
But because you have isolated
yourselves from your feelings

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:01.360 align:middle line:84%
to such a degree that they no
longer perform that function.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.540 align:middle line:84%
The reason why you
even see scary movies

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:04.900 align:middle line:90%
is to feel any emotion at all.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: You've
tapped them all down.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:12.240 align:middle line:84%
He said, the thing is is that
you need to let them out.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.030 align:middle line:84%
You need-- not to do
what the necessary-- some

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.400 align:middle line:84%
of your feelings wants
you to kill somebody.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.195 align:middle line:84%
Don't do what your feelings
want you to do, but feel them.

00:28:20.195 --> 00:28:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Acknowledge them.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: Acknowledge
them and feel them.

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:24.888 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: Because
then what happens

00:28:24.888 --> 00:28:26.820 align:middle line:84%
is you're sitting
on what we believe

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.580 align:middle line:84%
is a powder keg of dynamite,
but that powder keg,

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:33.150 align:middle line:84%
these books said, is your
life force, is your chi,

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:34.350 align:middle line:90%
is your energy.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.570 align:middle line:90%
And the reason why people--

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.280 align:middle line:90%
getting back to the reset--

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.370 align:middle line:84%
are feeling a loss
of control and power

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.820 align:middle line:84%
in their lives and the reason
why this has been reflected

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:49.380 align:middle line:84%
back to them in their personal
lives is because of the way

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.150 align:middle line:90%
they've treated their feelings.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Let me assure you that if you
accept your feelings for what

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:59.290 align:middle line:84%
they are, the power
to navigate what

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:01.150 align:middle line:84%
is about to happen
to the Earth will

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:05.110 align:middle line:84%
be sufficient to take care
of you and lead you to safety

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.225 align:middle line:84%
and give you the
life that you want.

00:29:07.225 --> 00:29:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And it makes sense because
if you have that corruption

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:12.490 align:middle line:90%
in your own base--

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: On your own dynamic.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and on
your own dynamic.

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- I mean, if you
trace back why you're angry,

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.260 align:middle line:84%
if you're trying to tamp
down anger-- no, no,

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:21.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to meditate
my anger away--

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:26.080 align:middle line:84%
no, I think it's
necessary to trace back

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.270 align:middle line:84%
the feeling of the
anger and where

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.570 align:middle line:84%
it came from because sometimes
it might be righteous anger.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's something so
unfair that you don't even

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:36.495 align:middle line:90%
know why you're angry anymore.

00:29:36.495 --> 00:29:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: Regina,
let me tell you

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.940 align:middle line:84%
how this book-- this is what
the universe set me up as.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: I'm Chinese.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: And we know-- you know
my joke about Chinese culture

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.660 align:middle line:90%
used to be?

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.210 align:middle line:84%
I would say this and
people would get horrified.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.877 align:middle line:84%
Do you know there's
not even a character

00:29:47.877 --> 00:29:51.090 align:middle line:84%
in the Chinese
language for emotions?

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:52.090 align:middle line:90%
That was a lie.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:54.465 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say
that would have to be a lie.

00:29:54.465 --> 00:29:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: That's a lie.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Because the Chinese
are so tapped out.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.328 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but how's
that going to manifest?

00:30:00.328 --> 00:30:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: Because they
don't allow it to come out

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:04.350 align:middle line:90%
until it is overpowering.

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:06.270 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese culture
is a yin culture.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a feminine culture.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And they had-- the
control issues in China

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:13.940 align:middle line:84%
have totally taken control of
it and shut the emotions down.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.700 align:middle line:84%
That's why Mao Zedong's
Cultural Revolution

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.210 align:middle line:84%
was so violent because
what it was up against was

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:21.225 align:middle line:90%
2,000 years of just--

00:30:21.225 --> 00:30:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Repression.

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: --repression,
all right?

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.605 align:middle line:90%
And it had to breakthrough.

00:30:24.605 --> 00:30:26.330 align:middle line:90%
Millions died.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:27.140 align:middle line:90%
Millions.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And now you have more
Chinese female billionaires

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.630 align:middle line:84%
than you have male
billionaires, all right?

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.760 align:middle line:84%
But no women are in the
Chinese party power structure.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: So it
only went so far.

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:40.950 align:middle line:84%
So unless they allow
it to go further,

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:42.620 align:middle line:90%
they're going to lock it down.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And in our own lives,
we're going to do that too.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
lesson came to me, OK?

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:51.590 align:middle line:84%
After hearing those words that
I'm using my thought to create,

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.382 align:middle line:90%
10 year prison, bust.

00:30:53.382 --> 00:30:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Then when I got to prison,
I threw the I Ching,

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.410 align:middle line:84%
I said, can I do
affirmations now?

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:58.710 align:middle line:90%
They said, sure, go ahead.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:01.495 align:middle line:84%
Because I was now
where I had to own it.

00:31:01.495 --> 00:31:02.870 align:middle line:84%
The "Right Use of
Will," I think,

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.375 align:middle line:90%
was supposed to come into me.

00:31:04.375 --> 00:31:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting
there reading it.

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Critical.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: What I just
told you in a nutshell.

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:09.560 align:middle line:90%
And then it said--

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and it talked about
emotions and feelings.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And it said, if you are in
a place not to your liking,

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.590 align:middle line:84%
perhaps you should
ask yourself why.

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:19.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, Regina,
or in a situation.

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:22.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, I hate my
job, I hate my-- no.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.970 align:middle line:84%
I had a 10-year sentence
in front of me, all right?

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:26.480 align:middle line:90%
So I closed my eyes.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.300 align:middle line:90%
I asked, why am I here?

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.730 align:middle line:90%
And the words came immediately.

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:33.845 align:middle line:84%
You have feelings
of powerlessness.

00:31:33.845 --> 00:31:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, I could have justified
it day in and day out.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.260 align:middle line:90%
My father is a Capricorn.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm an Aquarian.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.530 align:middle line:84%
He wanted me to study,
do everything right.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:42.330 align:middle line:90%
I had no time to myself.

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:44.580 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't in justification.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.730 align:middle line:90%
I was into going, holy smokes.

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:49.920 align:middle line:84%
If I had feelings
of powerlessness

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.350 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want to feel
them-- because who wants to feel

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:53.400 align:middle line:90%
powerlessness, you know?

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.183 align:middle line:90%
Who wants to feel that way?

00:31:55.183 --> 00:31:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And did everything I could so
he didn't have to feel them.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.940 align:middle line:84%
But what they did was
create a situation where

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.690 align:middle line:90%
I was forced to feel powerless.

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:02.490 align:middle line:90%
Get up.

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Go to sleep.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:05.280 align:middle line:90%
Years being told what to do.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.570 align:middle line:90%
That's powerlessness.

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, my God, if that's
what I did with my feelings,

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:15.000 align:middle line:84%
I better learn another way
of dealing with my feelings.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.520 align:middle line:84%
You talk about
getting the gospel?

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.780 align:middle line:90%
I got the gospel.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so this is
leading me in many directions,

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.640 align:middle line:84%
none of which we planned
on talking about.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.660 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's important.

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So here you have
these large cycles.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.160 align:middle line:84%
You have these large
masses of people.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.480 align:middle line:90%
You take cosmic cycles.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.530 align:middle line:90%
Add those in.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And here we're in a
time of, as you say,

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.260 align:middle line:84%
the end of the
Victoria equilibrium,

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.470 align:middle line:84%
which is mounting in
all these pressures

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and stresses that
we're already seeing.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Then astrologically, people
who cast the nation's chart

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:49.230 align:middle line:84%
say America is now on
the descent in terms

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:51.780 align:middle line:90%
of America's natal chart power.

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:55.830 align:middle line:84%
China is on the rise in
terms of their natal power.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:58.290 align:middle line:84%
How does this all
square in the end

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:02.850 align:middle line:84%
when the thing about America
that drew a lot of people to it

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:05.970 align:middle line:84%
was this incredible
creativity, the Wild West,

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:07.890 align:middle line:90%
a lot of expression of emotion?

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people wanted
to be in on the feelings of--

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Freedom.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --being in America.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.015 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Expansion.

00:33:13.015 --> 00:33:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Expansion.

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Expansion and freedom.

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, all that ended
globally more or less.

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:18.960 align:middle line:84%
The feelings of
that and pretty much

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.810 align:middle line:84%
globally with the
years of COVID,

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.550 align:middle line:90%
but we're all coming out of it.

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:26.310 align:middle line:84%
What happens when the
power then is transferred

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:29.820 align:middle line:84%
to a population who has
not had a chance to express

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:30.660 align:middle line:90%
their feelings?

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.040 align:middle line:90%
Are they going to go through--

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.820 align:middle line:84%
in China, in your opinion,
an emotional revolution?

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to-- are
they going to overthrow

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:40.860 align:middle line:84%
this way of-- what's
going to happen there?

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: A poem came to me.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Confucius, Mao, Deng, Xiaoping.

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:46.290 align:middle line:84%
It all adds up to
the same damn thing.

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:48.240 align:middle line:90%
Chinese people afraid to speak.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Beaten down, oh, so meek.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:51.750 align:middle line:90%
3,000 years of history.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.000 align:middle line:90%
3,000 years of tyranny.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.360 align:middle line:84%
China will remain corrupt
until the dragon rises up.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But deep inside of China's soul
lives a dragon without a role.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.330 align:middle line:90%
Yin and yang, each a pull.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:04.860 align:middle line:90%
Each a part of a greater whole.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, what
a beautiful poem.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.710 align:middle line:90%
What's the dragon?

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Your emotions.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:11.520 align:middle line:84%
The true source of
power of all of us.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:15.110 align:middle line:84%
The feminine power that
powers the masculine creation

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:16.350 align:middle line:90%
of paracreation.

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:17.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a balance.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
happen to them like it's

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.820 align:middle line:90%
going to happen to our country.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.400 align:middle line:84%
There's rebalancing going
on in each one of us.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.889 align:middle line:84%
The godsend of this is
that we're not in control.

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:28.378 align:middle line:84%
The godsend to me
is that the control

00:34:28.378 --> 00:34:29.670 align:middle line:90%
is that at a much higher level.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:30.389 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Much higher, yeah.

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: And much deeper that
most of us aren't aware of.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.500 align:middle line:90%
And I only have a glimpse of--

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.330 align:middle line:90%
I only have a glimpse of it.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And you know-- and to
me, I can rest my hat.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.540 align:middle line:84%
I can rest my life, I
can rest my love on it.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
all of the thoughts and ideas

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.960 align:middle line:84%
that, you know, some
central key players

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.290 align:middle line:84%
we all know the names of are
gaining increasing control

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:54.480 align:middle line:84%
and we're turning into
a more digital culture

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.320 align:middle line:84%
to say nothing of the fact that
in the world of entertainment,

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.320 align:middle line:84%
the most popular theme coming
up and rising big time right now

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.390 align:middle line:90%
is AI.

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: For pure definition,
in my scheme of things,

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:09.690 align:middle line:84%
I will use the
reset not in terms

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:13.500 align:middle line:84%
of the monetary reset which
is futile, like spitting

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.270 align:middle line:90%
in the ocean.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I understand their need
and their desperation.

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And I understand the
futility of them doing so.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:25.010 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm talking about is
the reset with a capital R,

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:25.810 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:27.268 align:middle line:84%
It's like I told
Martha last night,

00:35:27.268 --> 00:35:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I said, I should get a t-shirt
that says self-conscious

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:34.640 align:middle line:84%
but with a big S. That's what
I'm trying to get, all right?

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.820 align:middle line:84%
I was born into
self-consciousness

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.690 align:middle line:84%
with a small S. I'm just
trying to keep the same term

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:41.290 align:middle line:90%
but put a big S there.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So the reset at
the highest level

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:48.200 align:middle line:84%
is going to take all of
these things, all right?

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have to
worry about the details.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in fact, worrying
about the direction of it,

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:58.420 align:middle line:84%
of where it's going, is
counterproductive in my book.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.010 align:middle line:90%
It's understandable.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But it was just like when
I was going to prison.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't gone to
trial, all right?

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm facing-- when the feds
made a deal was for 20 years.

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:14.800 align:middle line:84%
My lawyer who I had-- one of
the top lawyers in the-- they

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.050 align:middle line:84%
made a documentary
about her called

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:18.100 align:middle line:90%
"Penny," the documentary.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.450 align:middle line:90%
PBS.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:22.090 align:middle line:90%
Shout out to Penny, all right?

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:24.710 align:middle line:90%
She took my case for free.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And the guy they were after
was going to pay her millions.

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:30.300 align:middle line:90%
She never told me.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:34.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not even-- she took my case
for free because she knew me.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Darryl,
they've offered

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.050 align:middle line:90%
20 years if you plead guilty.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:39.670 align:middle line:84%
I said, Penny,
that's like they're

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:43.002 align:middle line:84%
offering to shoot me below
the waist if I stand still.

00:36:43.002 --> 00:36:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No thank you.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: That's no deal at all.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No thank you.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: Well, because
I had Penny as a lawyer,

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.260 align:middle line:90%
I got 10 instead of 20.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:53.010 align:middle line:84%
But before the sentencing
I was in that state.

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:56.490 align:middle line:84%
There was another book called
"God Calling," all right?

00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was on Bucky Fuller's
nightstand when he died.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was channeled
to two women

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.440 align:middle line:90%
during the Great Depression.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.750 align:middle line:90%
And they were magnificent words.

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:08.160 align:middle line:90%
And what it said--

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm reading it.

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.590 align:middle line:84%
It said, it's like
you were on the deck

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.990 align:middle line:90%
of a ship in tremendous storms.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And the power of the ship goes
up and all you see is sky.

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And then the wave breaks and
all you see is the water.

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:24.060 align:middle line:84%
It says, you don't know
what's going to happen.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.320 align:middle line:90%
You're not in control.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
you're freaked out.

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:29.420 align:middle line:90%
Give me today.

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Give me tomorrow.

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:32.840 align:middle line:90%
Just be.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And that allowed me
to let go of thinking

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:36.890 align:middle line:90%
about am I going to get 20?

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.120 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to get 30?

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.660 align:middle line:90%
Am I never going to see anybody?

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.560 align:middle line:84%
I never thought about
not seeing my friends.

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I went over and--

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.292 align:middle line:90%
Rebecca, she's nine years old.

00:37:45.292 --> 00:37:47.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to see
her for a long time.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was her birthday
party and I sat there

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, well, maybe
I should go and be with her.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.072 align:middle line:90%
She's playing with her friends.

00:37:52.072 --> 00:37:53.085 align:middle line:90%
No, just watch her.

00:37:53.085 --> 00:37:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let her be.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:54.835 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Let her be.

00:37:54.835 --> 00:37:57.530 align:middle line:84%
She went to the
Sorbonne in Paris.

00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:59.480 align:middle line:90%
And so I did.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And those are words
that you can take

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:04.340 align:middle line:84%
to the bank in these
times, that there's

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.400 align:middle line:84%
a reset coming but the
reset is at a level

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.470 align:middle line:84%
that most people
don't believe it.

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
believe in that reset.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And for the people who don't
believe in it, I want to say,

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.460 align:middle line:84%
I understand your disbelief
because if the things that

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.210 align:middle line:84%
happened to me in my
life hadn't happened,

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:19.580 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't believe it either.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Regina, I would not
believe this stuff

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:24.860 align:middle line:84%
I believe because
it's so improbable.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:28.610 align:middle line:84%
It's so at odds with what I
believed to be true before I

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:29.930 align:middle line:90%
took my first hit of acid.

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think that
this audience is--

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have a
fabulous audience

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:34.772 align:middle line:90%
watching this right now.

00:38:34.772 --> 00:38:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
who really are

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:40.830 align:middle line:84%
trying to discern what is simply
to be able to be in a position.

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:42.560 align:middle line:84%
If it's surrender,
be in surrender.

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.810 align:middle line:84%
If it's prepare a little
bit on the material plane

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:46.190 align:middle line:84%
so you can eat
for a little while

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:48.680 align:middle line:84%
longer if things
go really badly.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.740 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's go to
physical survival needs.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.042 align:middle line:84%
In your opinion, in
the times coming up--

00:38:54.042 --> 00:38:56.000 align:middle line:84%
we didn't get a chance
to go through the cycles

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.610 align:middle line:84%
of hyperinflation we're in,
but we're in all of them.

00:38:58.610 --> 00:38:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: We're in all of them.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All the
telltale signs are there.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:01.310 align:middle line:90%
It's going to go down.

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:02.300 align:middle line:90%
It's only a matter of when.

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: It's going to go down.

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what should
people do on a physical level

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.157 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:39:06.157 --> 00:39:07.490 align:middle line:90%
And then we'll talk spiritually.

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:09.657 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: You know, the
wonderful thing about this--

00:39:09.657 --> 00:39:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and because we're talking
about a collective reality.

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, experience.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: That involves
people in New Guinea that

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.100 align:middle line:90%
never went to high school.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:19.820 align:middle line:90%
It's going to affect them.

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is a global--

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: This is
a global experience

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.030 align:middle line:90%
because we're all consciousness.

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:25.940 align:middle line:84%
We're all parts
of it, all right?

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's expressing and
experiencing itself through us

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:30.880 align:middle line:90%
at the same.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.050 align:middle line:90%
It never abandoned us.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:36.250 align:middle line:84%
But once we forgot about
it, we lost all sight of it.

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And to replace that
vision and the experience,

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.210 align:middle line:84%
we were told a lot of
stories, all right?

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:45.220 align:middle line:84%
One of the sayings
is, your children know

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.760 align:middle line:90%
not the love of your heart.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.070 align:middle line:90%
The children are not your face.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:52.370 align:middle line:84%
They pray to the image
they put in your place.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:53.170 align:middle line:90%
This is what it is.

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Most people are just playing
around with their stuff.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: But in their own
world, believer and nonbeliever

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.380 align:middle line:84%
alike, I know that
light still exists.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And you could quiet yourself
if you can during these times

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:08.690 align:middle line:90%
because you must.

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:11.990 align:middle line:84%
In the most momentous of times,
in the most volatile times,

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:14.730 align:middle line:84%
it is more important than ever
that you can quiet yourself,

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:15.530 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And in that quiet you can
ask, what should you do?

00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:23.220 align:middle line:84%
It's better than asking this
nutty acid hippy Chinaman

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.350 align:middle line:90%
who went to prison for a while.

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:26.520 align:middle line:90%
I could say some things.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.978 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, there are
common things that we've talked

00:40:28.978 --> 00:40:31.170 align:middle line:90%
about things like--

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:32.820 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to
have any assets,

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.500 align:middle line:84%
to allocate them to things
that are of true value.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Gold and silver.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:35.980 align:middle line:90%
Gold and silver.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:36.820 align:middle line:90%
They will make it through.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Get a little cash.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: They'll
make it through.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:40.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't think-- I don't
believe Bitcoin will.

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I believe that a crypto may
make it through, but not

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:44.400 align:middle line:90%
in any current form.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: Not that it won't have
value, but in terms of money,

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:48.530 align:middle line:90%
we're the enemy--

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and the
Chinese went all down on gold.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.650 align:middle line:90%
They've got a lot of gold.

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: There were
two or two experiences

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:57.490 align:middle line:84%
on the planet when money
as we know it disappeared.

00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: One was
in China after 1661.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.410 align:middle line:84%
When I said they
outlawed fiat, all right?

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:08.250 align:middle line:84%
The Qing dynasty came in, and
they were told by the people,

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:09.270 align:middle line:90%
oh, this is--

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:11.700 align:middle line:84%
They looked at it
and they go, no, OK?

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Sixth generation on the books.

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:17.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we'll make it illegal.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:20.070 align:middle line:84%
What happened in
China was silver

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:22.260 align:middle line:90%
became the medium of exchange.

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:23.880 align:middle line:90%
Not issued by the state.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in
my friend's book--

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.050 align:middle line:90%
Ralph Foster.

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Brilliant book if
you want to read it.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.020 align:middle line:90%
It's brilliant.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.990 align:middle line:84%
It's probably the
best book on gold

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:37.283 align:middle line:84%
that rarely mentions it because
it's the best book on fiat.

00:41:37.283 --> 00:41:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And he goes back
to the beginning.

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:40.033 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's his name again?

00:41:40.033 --> 00:41:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Ralph Terry Foster.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:42.055 align:middle line:90%
Ralph T. Foster.

00:41:42.055 --> 00:41:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Foster, OK.

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: Called "The
History of Fiat".

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: The History of
our Money, whatever it is.

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:52.380 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is, before
the Brits came along,

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:57.900 align:middle line:84%
from 1661 to 1748 were
the First Opium War.

00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:01.030 align:middle line:84%
That is approximately
100, 120 years,

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:02.550 align:middle line:90%
which is a decent is of time.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:03.968 align:middle line:90%
Longer than you and I--

00:42:03.968 --> 00:42:05.760 align:middle line:84%
either of us is going
to be on this planet.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:09.210 align:middle line:84%
The functioning currency
in a very large country

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.010 align:middle line:90%
was pure silver.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:12.180 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else.

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Pure silver.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And Ralph said in his book
is that, kids, they knew.

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:18.420 align:middle line:90%
They knew.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.485 align:middle line:90%
Little ingots-- tails.

00:42:20.485 --> 00:42:21.360 align:middle line:90%
They call them tails.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Little melted down
things of silver, OK?

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And the only other
instance I know

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:28.830 align:middle line:84%
when they had a complete
collapse of fiat

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:30.210 align:middle line:84%
I only found out
about last month

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:31.490 align:middle line:84%
when I was talking to a
friend of mine from Vietnam.

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What?

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Gold in Vietnam.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:39.060 align:middle line:84%
When Vietnam fell to the
communists, when all the money

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.200 align:middle line:90%
went out, when it was in--

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, before it fell to the
communists but after it

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:44.850 align:middle line:84%
started falling
and it was chaos.

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:49.980 align:middle line:84%
They had hyperinflation and the
dong went to billions to what.

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.420 align:middle line:90%
Gold became the currency.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Currency.

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.160 align:middle line:84%
So still to this day,
although you can read

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.730 align:middle line:90%
every point of view on this--

00:42:57.730 --> 00:42:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Sure.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:42:59.905 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the
fact is you still

00:42:59.905 --> 00:43:02.523 align:middle line:84%
have something physical that
has value that you can use.

00:43:02.523 --> 00:43:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: In times of chaos.

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In times of chaos.

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:04.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: A safe haven.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:05.615 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Safe haven.

00:43:05.615 --> 00:43:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And what about cash when
you're talking Fiat?

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:08.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Until the--

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:11.250 align:middle line:90%


00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:12.600 align:middle line:90%
I made a--

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm the beneficiary
of Antal Fekete.

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:17.010 align:middle line:90%
He was like a mentor to me.

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And he introduced me--
through him I met this kid

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:22.590 align:middle line:84%
who's the most brilliant-- one
of the most brilliant people

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:23.390 align:middle line:90%
I've ever--

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Sandeep Jaitly.

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about this last week

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:28.985 align:middle line:84%
and we were talking
about money and assets.

00:43:28.985 --> 00:43:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
know, Darryl, he said,

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:32.900 align:middle line:84%
I know you're not going
to agree with me on this.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said, where would you
put your extra floating fiat?

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:38.660 align:middle line:90%
US Treasury.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, I agree
with you because the US

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:43.560 align:middle line:90%
dollar is going to go down.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.740 align:middle line:84%
But until fiat goes
down, it's going

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.150 align:middle line:90%
to be the last man standing.

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I have
read from many quarters.

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: It's going to
be the last man standing.

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The last man standing.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: But the
last man standing

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:54.440 align:middle line:84%
is going to be on his
knees and then on his back

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.450 align:middle line:90%
and then in the ground.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: So after
fiat collapses,

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.227 align:middle line:84%
your treasure are
going to be worth--

00:44:00.227 --> 00:44:02.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what they're
going to be worth.

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.037 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they make
them worth something

00:44:04.037 --> 00:44:05.870 align:middle line:84%
because they're trying
to salvage something.

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:07.245 align:middle line:84%
But they're not
going to be worth

00:44:07.245 --> 00:44:09.620 align:middle line:84%
what they were the day
before fiat collapses.

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.057 align:middle line:84%
So that's all I'm saying
between then and now.

00:44:12.057 --> 00:44:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So maybe have a
little silver and gold around.

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL: Yeah.

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe have a
little bit of cash around.

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: Yeah,
have cash around.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And what about us?

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: We don't know how
long this is going to last.

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:19.975 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Each other?

00:44:19.975 --> 00:44:21.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really
the spiritual component

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:24.140 align:middle line:84%
that is the Great
Reset of coming

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:29.450 align:middle line:84%
to learn to rely on one another
in very real ways again,

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:32.120 align:middle line:84%
coming back together in
community and collaboration

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.220 align:middle line:90%
instead of competition.

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:35.360 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that part of it?

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: You know,
Regina, I mean,

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:41.280 align:middle line:84%
it gets really personal
that I should probably

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:46.800 align:middle line:84%
be less angry, more accepting,
more tolerant, and kinder

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.290 align:middle line:90%
to people.

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: And we all
should in these latter days

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:54.710 align:middle line:90%
because we're all parts of it.

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it wants
us to be to each other.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Because it knows
it and we don't.

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:03.680 align:middle line:90%
It knows it and we've forgotten.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.440 align:middle line:10%
And if there's any
purpose to this collapse

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.500 align:middle line:10%
is perhaps that we're going
to remember a little bit

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.960 align:middle line:10%
and then a little more
and then a little more

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:18.460 align:middle line:10%
until I recognize the you
is the I am that I am too.

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And on that,
we'll say goodbye.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Darryl, thank you so much.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.940 align:middle line:10%
I love your passion.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:26.240 align:middle line:10%
I love the extremes
of your experience

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.180 align:middle line:10%
so you can reflect back to us.

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I love the story of power, what
power is and where it isn't.

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And when you've had none, you
really know what that means.

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And then to reflect
it to these guys that

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:39.550 align:middle line:84%
feel they're at the top and in
control of the show that they

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:41.500 align:middle line:84%
truly don't have power
either because we've

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:46.090 align:middle line:84%
entered more mega cycles that
are far beyond their control.

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:48.020 align:middle line:84%
But we still have
a place within it.

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.120 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Darryl.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL: Thank you,
Regina, for giving me

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:57.580 align:middle line:84%
this forum that I never ever
thought I would ever have.

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And so, until next time,
thank you so much, Darryl.

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:05.960 align:middle line:10%
