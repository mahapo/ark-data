>> REGINA MEREDITH: No field
is more fraught with illusion,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.270 align:middle line:10%
delusion, and disinformation
than that of ufology

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.230 align:middle line:10%
and the study of
extraterrestrials.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Greg Bishop has been
trying to unravel

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:84%
the threads of these
intriguing topics,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:84%
along with the eccentric
characters that populate

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.850 align:middle line:90%
this field of research.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.240 align:middle line:84%
We'll attempt to untangle some
of this in this conversation.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.010 align:middle line:10%
It's-- I mean, you know, we're
going to go back a little bit

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.840 align:middle line:10%
in time to some of
the earlier stuff.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.910 align:middle line:10%
In fact, we're going
back in time in general,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.770 align:middle line:10%
kind of looking at what set the
stage for this absolute melee

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.510 align:middle line:10%
that we're
experiencing right now.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.590 align:middle line:10%
It's a freak show.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.423 align:middle line:10%
>>GREG BISHOP: Yeah.

00:01:04.423 --> 00:01:06.054 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's always been.

00:01:06.054 --> 00:01:07.720 align:middle line:10%
It's just a different
format with it now

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.370 align:middle line:10%
and information flies
so fast, so these things

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.100 align:middle line:10%
can develop-- instead
of over years,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.640 align:middle line:10%
they'll develop
over days, you know.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.681 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, what got
you kind of down that path

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:90%
with this phenomenon?

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.550 align:middle line:84%
What intrigued you and really
took you down the rabbit hole?

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Usually that question
I answer by saying my father

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.487 align:middle line:84%
used to take us to the
library when I was a kid--

00:01:26.487 --> 00:01:27.570 align:middle line:90%
my sister and I were kids.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's like, what?

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:90%
The library?

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.000 align:middle line:10%
He said, "Pick up
two or three books

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.624 align:middle line:10%
and we will bring them back next
week after you have read them,

00:01:34.624 --> 00:01:36.860 align:middle line:10%
so you will be reading them."

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.030 align:middle line:10%
I don't know why--

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.130 align:middle line:10%
I went to the first section
of the library, which

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.505 align:middle line:10%
is all the UFO books,
when I was six--

00:01:42.505 --> 00:01:43.305 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Really?

00:01:43.305 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: --five years old.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And from five years old
probably up to about 10,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:84%
I read every single UFO,
Bigfoot, and ghost book

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:90%
in the library.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.000 align:middle line:10%
And then we went to--

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.710 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: I mean,
that's interesting.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.120 align:middle line:10%
We went to another library
and I found the books

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.280 align:middle line:10%
that I hadn't read in that
one, and I read those, too.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: And I don't know
why I was interested in that.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.378 align:middle line:84%
I read other things,
too, you know.

00:01:59.378 --> 00:02:02.030 align:middle line:10%
I read fiction and I read other
children's books and all that,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.660 align:middle line:10%
but I'm reading Jacques Vallee
when I'm eight years old.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.460 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Oh, boy.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.412 align:middle line:10%
That's precocious.

00:02:06.412 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:10%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.320 align:middle line:10%
I love it.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: And I
don't even know if I

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.150 align:middle line:84%
understood what I was reading,
but it was intriguing to me.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: And then
that continued in life.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I forgot about it
until after I left college.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.960 align:middle line:84%
After I finished
college and I had

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:84%
a period of deep depression--
like suicidal depression--

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and somehow the
subject came back,

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:84%
and it might have saved
my life, because I

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.250 align:middle line:90%
started writing about it.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Why
were you depressed?

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.694 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:02:27.694 --> 00:02:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: A girlfriend
left me and a guy

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.172 align:middle line:84%
I was working with who
was a friend of mine

00:02:31.172 --> 00:02:33.380 align:middle line:84%
kicked me out of his office
for no discernible reason

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.540 align:middle line:90%
and locked all the doors.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, and
you're a young guy,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.170 align:middle line:90%
and that stuff gets hard.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, I was
20 when that happened.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: So it was--

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The girlfriend
leaving you is enough to--

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --for suicidal
tendencies and that age.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.324 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:02:43.324 --> 00:02:44.625 align:middle line:84%
Well, she cheated on me
and left, and then I--

00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, god.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Love, betrayal.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.180 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: But of course,
it never happens to me.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I was a
depressive type anyway.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.289 align:middle line:84%
You know, I had to work
myself out of that, too, but--

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Then you rediscovered
your passion for these

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.760 align:middle line:90%
subjects.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Exactly.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I started writing
about it, so I wrote an article

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and a little magazine
published it,

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.390 align:middle line:90%
and then I went on from there.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So was it just a
matter of raw intrigue for you,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:84%
or was it-- were you really
attempting to find some kind

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:90%
of truth amidst it?

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: I think if you
try to find some truth in it

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.510 align:middle line:90%
and this--

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.060 align:middle line:90%
I didn't realize that then.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.180 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of a
losing proposition.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.010 align:middle line:90%
What you try to do is--

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.010 align:middle line:84%
what I've done is
look for understanding

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:84%
more than an answer,
and even more valuable

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.460 align:middle line:84%
is I've met so many cool
people and nice people

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:84%
and intelligent people that
just have floated me up

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.399 align:middle line:84%
to their level, and that
is what is amazing to me.

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:39.440 align:middle line:10%
That's the most amazing
thing about the subject--

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:10%
not what the answer might be.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.702 align:middle line:84%
Just the experience of
being involved with it.

00:03:44.702 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I'm not writing
books on all this stuff

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:84%
because I want to be famous
or get on TV or you know--

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.436 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: That's kind of--
it's like window dressing

00:03:52.436 --> 00:03:55.190 align:middle line:84%
to the main thing, which
is connection with people

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and learning about things that
most people don't know too much

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.410 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: True, and the
common perception, at large,

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.504 align:middle line:84%
is that people that are into
this wear tinfoil hats and are

00:04:06.504 --> 00:04:08.420 align:middle line:84%
fruits-- all the fruits
and nuts, as they say,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.610 align:middle line:84%
roll to California in
the UFO community, right?

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Mm-hmm.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.578 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And in fact, you're
talking about a lot of very,

00:04:13.578 --> 00:04:15.821 align:middle line:10%
very highly-educated,
highly-placed individuals

00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:17.779 align:middle line:10%
around the planet that
are involved with this--

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.230 align:middle line:10%
certainly where the intelligence
agencies come in, and I really

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.270 align:middle line:10%
want to get into that.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: OK.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That part of it.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, and a
lot of those people,

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.840 align:middle line:90%
rightly so, just keep--

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.500 align:middle line:84%
they keep their
interest very quiet.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.008 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: I'm trying
to do that more now.

00:04:31.008 --> 00:04:33.560 align:middle line:84%
I-- like a lot of people
that are into this,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.160 align:middle line:84%
I know far more people than I
ever talk about or say, look,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:90%
I know this person, or--

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.665 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:04:38.665 --> 00:04:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: It's-- you're
doing all this quiet research

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.300 align:middle line:84%
and making these personal
contacts with people,

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:84%
and you're giving them
information they may not

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.330 align:middle line:84%
necessarily know, they're giving
you information you may not

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.056 align:middle line:84%
necessarily know, and neither
of us are using it to get rich

00:04:52.056 --> 00:04:53.930 align:middle line:84%
or famous or to cheat
the other, or whatever.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.030 align:middle line:84%
We're just trying to learn
things from each other,

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.029 align:middle line:84%
and that to me, is another
valuable part of it--

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:03.435 align:middle line:84%
just the access to somebody you
can ask a question directly.

00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:05.560 align:middle line:84%
That's why I started the
magazine with my friends--

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.920 align:middle line:90%
"Excluded Middle."

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever said no
to an interview, which

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I was completely surprised by
that, and some of these people

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.090 align:middle line:90%
became friends.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really,
really smart people

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.530 align:middle line:84%
who I couldn't understand
why they were even

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.010 align:middle line:90%
giving me the time of day.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.340 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, what is
the common bond between you?

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.693 align:middle line:84%
Between-- because I have
friends in that community

00:05:24.693 --> 00:05:28.000 align:middle line:84%
as well, and for you,
what is the common bond

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.650 align:middle line:90%
that you all share?

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Curiosity,
mistrust of authority,

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:84%
not liking being told
what to think or do.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.630 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.600 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: I think
that's a big part of it.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I think so, too.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those are my
personality traits as well,

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.220 align:middle line:84%
so maybe that's why I have
friends in the community

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.700 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.575 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:45.575 --> 00:05:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this whole thing
about having the right to be

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.000 align:middle line:84%
able to freely examine
all information--

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You know, and
make your own mind up--

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.940 align:middle line:90%
sovereignty is huge in this.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Right.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.950 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I believe
very little of it.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
I take stock in
very little of it,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.575 align:middle line:84%
but I'm interested in
just about all of it.

00:06:03.575 --> 00:06:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you're not
saying that you're really along

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.079 align:middle line:90%
the line of the skeptics.

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
well-known TV skeptics.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: I am
skeptical, but I'm not

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.950 align:middle line:90%
a fundamentalist skeptic.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Skeptical means you don't make
a conclusion about something

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.710 align:middle line:84%
until you have enough of
the facts in front of you

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:90%
to make an informed decision.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: And as you
know and a lot of people

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.640 align:middle line:84%
probably know, a
lot of this stuff,

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:84%
you can't make a
determination about it.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.161 align:middle line:10%
You just have to
remain interested.

00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:10%
There's something
in the latest book

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.118 align:middle line:10%
I wrote where I said I think
a really good attitude for UFO

00:06:32.118 --> 00:06:35.900 align:middle line:10%
study is total interest
and total agnosticism.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.190 align:middle line:84%
No, that makes sense,
because it requires

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.773 align:middle line:84%
that degree of
commitment just for you

00:06:40.773 --> 00:06:43.690 align:middle line:84%
to be able to dig down and
ferret out these little pieces

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.400 align:middle line:90%
from obscure or secret sources.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Right.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You know.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.678 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: I don't
get a hold of one

00:06:47.678 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:90%
and say, this is what it is.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I tell people that.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.626 align:middle line:84%
It's like, as soon
as somebody tells you

00:06:51.626 --> 00:06:53.980 align:middle line:84%
they know what's going on,
run away from them very fast.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.280 align:middle line:84%
I totally-- any kind
of proclamations--

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
this is the way, this is
what's going to happen next--

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.790 align:middle line:90%
run like heck.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.088 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: OK, let's talk about
what happened the beginning

00:07:04.088 --> 00:07:06.970 align:middle line:10%
of-- this particular book,
you did an essay on Bill Moore

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.010 align:middle line:10%
and the infamous speech
he made at MUFON.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.810 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:11.470 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about it.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.480 align:middle line:10%
It's a good place to dive
into the Intelligence,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:19.120 align:middle line:10%
and because they figure
prominently in both information

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.590 align:middle line:10%
and disinformation.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.060 align:middle line:84%
I get asked lots of
questions about Bill Moore.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.700 align:middle line:10%
I met him very soon after--

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.520 align:middle line:10%
while I was working
at that friend's place

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:10%
that he kicked me out of--

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.720 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.292 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: That office was a
block from Bill Moore's office.

00:07:33.292 --> 00:07:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: In 1987--

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.337 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk
about who he is-- yeah, '87.

00:07:37.337 --> 00:07:38.170 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.215 align:middle line:90%
Don't be vain.

00:07:39.215 --> 00:07:42.737 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about who he is and
what the speech was-- what--

00:07:42.737 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: All right.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The contents of
the speech and why this was

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.780 align:middle line:90%
so fundamental.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Right.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.090 align:middle line:90%
He was a UFO researcher.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.050 align:middle line:90%
I knew him as that.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.030 align:middle line:90%
I contacted him.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.120 align:middle line:84%
My perspective of
it was a couple

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.470 align:middle line:84%
of months before the talk, which
was 1989, MUFON, Las Vegas,

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.799 align:middle line:84%
was that he said-- all
he told me is, "I'm

00:08:01.799 --> 00:08:03.090 align:middle line:90%
going to blow their socks off."

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.120 align:middle line:84%
"Well, what are you
going to say, Bill?"

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.140 align:middle line:90%
"Ah, I can't tell you.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm still
working on the talk."

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.400 align:middle line:84%
So we get to this--
get to MUFON.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.150 align:middle line:84%
He actually asked me if
I could please take over

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.280 align:middle line:90%
and help at his book table.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.880 align:middle line:84%
But during the talk,
I went in and watched.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:84%
That speech was the
best public speech

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.864 align:middle line:84%
I've ever seen on anything--
not even just UFOs.

00:08:22.864 --> 00:08:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, enlighten us.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Because of the--

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.760 align:middle line:90%
because of the reaction.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.562 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:26.562 --> 00:08:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: There were
rumors flying around

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.020 align:middle line:84%
that he was involved with
Intelligence, which he was.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:37.419 align:middle line:84%
That he was involved in trying
to discredit Paul Bennewitz,

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:39.250 align:middle line:90%
which he wasn't--

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.559 align:middle line:84%
at least, not from
his point of view.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:84%
The rumors were so bad
that half the people

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:84%
at the convention
that were speakers

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.330 align:middle line:84%
broke off and had
their own convention.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.370 align:middle line:90%
John Lear, Bill Cooper--

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.560 align:middle line:90%
people like that.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What did
that convention become?

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.896 align:middle line:84%
What was the name of
the other convention?

00:08:57.896 --> 00:08:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: I don't remember.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:08:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And where
did the International--

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: It was the Alternate
New MUFON Convention.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Where did the
International UFO Congress come

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:04.300 align:middle line:90%
into this?

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: They weren't that--
it wasn't at the UFO Congress.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Those people have all spoken at
the International UFO Congress,

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.900 align:middle line:84%
with the exception
possibly of Bill Moore.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.260 align:middle line:90%
So let's go ahead.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's figure-- let's
continue on with his story.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: So he comes up with
all this anticipation about

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.170 align:middle line:90%
what he's going to say, and--

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.802 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What was the crowd
expecting he would talk about?

00:09:22.802 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: They were
expecting that he was going

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.260 align:middle line:90%
to talk about his involvement.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Not only did he talk
about his involvement,

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.300 align:middle line:84%
he talked about other things
that they did not expect,

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.700 align:middle line:84%
didn't know about, and
when I talked to him later,

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.560 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Would you
have changed any way

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.065 align:middle line:84%
about how you presented
that information, given

00:09:38.065 --> 00:09:40.284 align:middle line:90%
the-- you know, in hindsight?"

00:09:40.284 --> 00:09:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Yeah,
I think I would have

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:42.895 align:middle line:90%
been a little less arrogant."

00:09:42.895 --> 00:09:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: And the
reason he was is

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.020 align:middle line:84%
because he had so many
accusations thrown at him.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.060 align:middle line:84%
People didn't know what
they were talking about,

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.867 align:middle line:84%
had no idea what was
going on with him,

00:09:50.867 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and were making things up and
accusing him of the things

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.520 align:middle line:90%
that they'd made up.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.687 align:middle line:90%
That's why he was irritated.

00:09:55.687 --> 00:09:57.436 align:middle line:84%
And I must say that
he's a friend of mine.

00:09:57.436 --> 00:09:59.680 align:middle line:84%
He's been a friend of
mine since the late '80s.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.271 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: People say,
why do you trust him?

00:10:02.271 --> 00:10:04.030 align:middle line:84%
He's a disinformation--
this and that.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.770 align:middle line:84%
I trust him because
he's a friend,

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.195 align:middle line:84%
and I've never
caught him in a lie

00:10:07.195 --> 00:10:10.960 align:middle line:84%
or telling me anything
that he shouldn't or that

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.130 align:middle line:90%
was inaccurate.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.714 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you trust
your friends, right?

00:10:13.714 --> 00:10:14.513 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: And he's
not a monster.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.470 align:middle line:90%
He's just a UFO researcher.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:18.730 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: But what
he did say is, "Look.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:21.696 align:middle line:84%
I was involved with
Paul Bennewitz.

00:10:21.696 --> 00:10:23.695 align:middle line:84%
You know I was, but this
is how I was involved."

00:10:23.695 --> 00:10:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But we're going
to get into his story too.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Right.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The
revelations in this--

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:32.030 align:middle line:84%
what would've been the
outcome of his participation

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.510 align:middle line:84%
with the Intelligence
community and the UFO field?

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:90%
What did he contribute?

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Oh, well, what
he contributed, I think,

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.167 align:middle line:84%
was that he told everybody,
look don't trust people

00:10:43.167 --> 00:10:44.750 align:middle line:84%
from the government
when they tell you

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.140 align:middle line:84%
they're telling you secrets
that they're only telling you.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.550 align:middle line:90%
You're not special.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.180 align:middle line:84%
It's for a completely
different set of circumstances

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.915 align:middle line:84%
than you even think
that it's for.

00:10:54.915 --> 00:10:57.290 align:middle line:84%
It's basically just to steer
you in a direction-- a group

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.390 align:middle line:84%
of people in a direction--
and to cover up

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:03.590 align:middle line:84%
basically national security
issues, exotic technology,

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:04.610 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily having
to do with aliens,

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:84%
deals with aliens for
technology in exchange

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.440 align:middle line:84%
for abductions--
anything like that.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's just a sideshow
distraction for anything that

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.840 align:middle line:84%
the government wishes or
military wishes to cover up

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.640 align:middle line:90%
at that time?

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yes.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.691 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: And having to do with
their projects, not because--

00:11:22.691 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the military is
out to say that they know what

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:84%
the UFO subject is and they know
what extra human consciousness

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.260 align:middle line:90%
is or anything like that.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.810 align:middle line:90%
I think they probably do.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.862 align:middle line:84%
I also think they're
extremely confused about it,

00:11:34.862 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and they can't do
anything about it

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.903 align:middle line:84%
and they don't know
how to explain it.

00:11:37.903 --> 00:11:40.670 align:middle line:84%
That's the cover-up, not that
they know what's going on.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.152 align:middle line:84%
You know, that was one
of the lessons I think

00:11:43.152 --> 00:11:44.360 align:middle line:90%
that came out of that speech.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And people were
yelling at him, people

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.530 align:middle line:90%
ran out of the room crying--

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because they thought
they were in the know about

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:51.140 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.990 align:middle line:84%
They just said that they
felt they had been duped.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:55.474 align:middle line:84%
They felt they
had been betrayed,

00:11:55.474 --> 00:11:57.640 align:middle line:84%
because basically he said,
"Look, I-- they told me--

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.181 align:middle line:84%
they asked me about
other researchers

00:11:59.181 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:84%
and what they were doing and
what they were thinking."

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "And
I didn't tell you

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.700 align:middle line:84%
anything about this because
I was part of my deal.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:05.824 align:middle line:90%
I was getting information."

00:12:05.824 --> 00:12:07.550 align:middle line:10%
He broke the MJ-12 documents.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:08.360 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.735 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: Which he now believes
are complete fabrication.

00:12:10.735 --> 00:12:11.899 align:middle line:90%
At that time, he didn't.

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, tell me
what the implication was

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.890 align:middle line:90%
of introducing the MK Ultra--

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:16.690 align:middle line:90%
MJ--

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: MJ-12.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --MJ-12
documents to--

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Well, the implication
was that the government knew

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.938 align:middle line:84%
what the UFO subject
was about, had known

00:12:22.938 --> 00:12:24.410 align:middle line:84%
about it since
the Roswell crash,

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and there was a group in the
government that controlled

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.025 align:middle line:90%
all this information.

00:12:27.025 --> 00:12:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: There may be--

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's MJ-12.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But why did he
believe then over time that

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.571 align:middle line:84%
they were giving him
this information?

00:12:36.571 --> 00:12:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: He knew that there--

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.295 align:middle line:84%
he was getting disinformation
right from the beginning.

00:12:41.295 --> 00:12:42.095 align:middle line:90%
He knew that.

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But he
spread it anyway?

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Was it a deal he
made or something?

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: No, he actually
put out a book set

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:47.720 align:middle line:90%
called "The MJ-12 Documents."

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Examined each document
and said, is this true?

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.260 align:middle line:90%
Is it false?

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.321 align:middle line:84%
What is the evidence
we have for this?

00:12:54.321 --> 00:12:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And something like a third
to a half of the documents,

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.220 align:middle line:84%
he said either false
or inconclusive.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: So he tried
to be honest about it.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:00.950 align:middle line:90%
He didn't--

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:02.533 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How did
he work both sides?

00:13:02.533 --> 00:13:04.700 align:middle line:84%
If he's with-- if he's
playing with and receiving

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.780 align:middle line:90%
information--

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:84%
disinformation from the
intelligence community

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.357 align:middle line:84%
and yet ratting
it out, how did he

00:13:09.357 --> 00:13:10.773 align:middle line:84%
continue any kind
of relationship?

00:13:10.773 --> 00:13:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: He ratted it out--

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.830 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.460 align:middle line:84%
He ratted it out, as
you say, after his--

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.390 align:middle line:84%
basically he found out
all he could by 1989.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: He wasn't
finding out anything new

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:84%
so he said-- and then he went to
the people he was working with

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and said, "Look, I'm going
to give a speech about this

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:25.640 align:middle line:90%
and what happened."

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.270 align:middle line:90%
And they said, "Sure.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.070 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead."

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it was with the
OK of the people he was working

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.590 align:middle line:84%
with, because they
just said look,

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:84%
this operation is
finished, we don't really

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.790 align:middle line:84%
care what people think about
it, and we're moving on.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So Bill was able to talk
about it at that point.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I think he was
trying to do everybody a favor,

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.880 align:middle line:84%
even though it was a backhanded
favor, by saying look,

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:90%
this is what happens.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I know because I was
in the middle of it.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.006 align:middle line:84%
Other people are
involved with it.

00:13:50.006 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Researchers are
involved with it,

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.171 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not at liberty
to say who they are,

00:13:53.171 --> 00:13:57.605 align:middle line:84%
because it's their business, and
you should watch out for this.

00:13:57.605 --> 00:14:00.630 align:middle line:84%
This is prevalent, or at
least it was back then.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.439 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I
observe repeatedly-- now,

00:14:03.439 --> 00:14:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been in this
as long as you have.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I started maybe 20
years ago just--

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.810 align:middle line:84%
19 to 20 years ago going
to all the conferences

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and meeting with them, because
I was a journalist then, too,

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and talking about
this and so forth.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.050 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that
comes up a lot--

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:20.330 align:middle line:84%
not that different
from society at large,

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.590 align:middle line:84%
but maybe more prominently
by a bit, is ego--

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.300 align:middle line:84%
the need for the
people in the industry

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.619 align:middle line:84%
to feel like they're gods
dispensing godly information,

00:14:30.619 --> 00:14:31.910 align:middle line:90%
and they'll almost sell their--

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Which industry?

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:90%
You mean the Intelligence?

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Ufology.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Oh, yeah, ufology.

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Ufology.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: That's a
huge problem, is ego.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that's why
I want to bring that up,

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.245 align:middle line:84%
because there are other people
who are more modest that--

00:14:42.245 --> 00:14:44.330 align:middle line:84%
well, like John Mack
was pretty modest man--

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.300 align:middle line:84%
he was a good man who took it
on as a project at Harvard--

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.450 align:middle line:90%
you know, clinical research--

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:84%
to find out about the
abductee phenomena.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:53.600 align:middle line:90%
Was there any truth?

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Was there commonality
to these experiences?

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.590 align:middle line:10%
Which he found there was.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.084 align:middle line:10%
And then what happened to
his life, trying to be--

00:15:00.084 --> 00:15:01.500 align:middle line:10%
they tried to strip
him of tenure.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.440 align:middle line:10%
Danny Sheehan came in and shook
things up and kept him in place

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.240 align:middle line:10%
at Harvard.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.860 align:middle line:10%
Head of Clinical
Psychology-- that's

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.384 align:middle line:10%
crazy that they would go
that far, because he dared

00:15:10.384 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:10%
have an open enough mind to
go into that area of research,

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.220 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:13.520 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.635 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: But he's rare.

00:15:14.635 --> 00:15:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.865 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: He's rare.

00:15:15.865 --> 00:15:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
norm in that field.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Mm, I think the
norm is people getting

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:25.460 align:middle line:84%
into it because they think they
can get people to pay attention

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.995 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:15:26.995 --> 00:15:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I'd agree.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: And the
problem becomes, even

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:34.155 align:middle line:84%
subconsciously, what can I get
into that gets the most people

00:15:34.155 --> 00:15:36.530 align:middle line:84%
to pay attention to me, and
gets me on the most TV shows,

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and gets me in the most news
interviews and all that?

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Not what I think is
the most important,

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.150 align:middle line:84%
or what might contribute
to understanding.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:middle line:84%
All it is is how do you
get people to pay attention

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:50.960 align:middle line:90%
to yourself.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.330 align:middle line:90%
And I was at Roswell this last--

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.280 align:middle line:84%
about two weeks ago for
the 70th anniversary.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:84%
I was giving a talk,
and I keep seeing

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:84%
at every conference I
go to, if I'm speaking,

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.892 align:middle line:84%
I can see those people, and I
don't pay any attention to them

00:16:01.892 --> 00:16:03.350 align:middle line:84%
and I don't talk
to them, because I

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.620 align:middle line:90%
get nothing out of them.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go out
and start telling people,

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.711 align:middle line:84%
I don't think this
person-- you know.

00:16:07.711 --> 00:16:10.240 align:middle line:84%
It's-- my job is not the
whistleblower or cutting people

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.040 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The whistleblower
on the whistleblower.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.760 align:middle line:90%
Cutting people down, all that's.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.560 align:middle line:90%
So you know what?

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.370 align:middle line:84%
If that person's going
to do their thing,

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.840 align:middle line:84%
there is no way for me to
really make any dent in that,

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:90%
because people--

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.521 align:middle line:84%
once you start telling people,
this person is probably not

00:16:22.521 --> 00:16:24.770 align:middle line:84%
really-- have-- doesn't have
all their ducks in a row,

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:25.430 align:middle line:90%
and they're like--

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.830 align:middle line:84%
that just makes people more--
their belief gets strengthened.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They're entrenched.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Yeah,
they get entrenched,

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.130 align:middle line:84%
so it's kind of
like, you know what?

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.490 align:middle line:90%
They're going to do their thing.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So I pay attention
to people that I

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.340 align:middle line:84%
like, people that I think that
have good thought process,

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.770 align:middle line:84%
have-- and are
not too ego-based.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:41.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the less
ego, the better.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I try to
do the same thing.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:90%
If you could get ego out of--

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.300 align:middle line:84%
if you could get
ego out of life--

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: --out of
ufology, I think

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:52.320 align:middle line:84%
a lot more useful
information would come--

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.404 align:middle line:90%
would rise to the surface.

00:16:53.404 --> 00:16:54.203 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:16:54.203 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So how does the
Intelligence community,

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.190 align:middle line:84%
from your understanding, because
you've known some spooks, too,

00:16:59.190 --> 00:16:59.990 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:05.599 align:middle line:84%
And how do they go
about using the egotists

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:08.317 align:middle line:90%
in this field as tools?

00:17:08.317 --> 00:17:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: You almost answered
the question by saying it.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:14.060 align:middle line:84%
You use somebody's ego and
their sense of self-importance

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.089 align:middle line:84%
to pass some information
or disinformation,

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:19.520 align:middle line:84%
or-- well, disinformation
is information

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.067 align:middle line:84%
that seems to make sense
that has mostly BS in it,

00:17:22.067 --> 00:17:23.150 align:middle line:90%
but a little bit of truth.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.849 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:24.829 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: So if you
check up on the truth,

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:26.245 align:middle line:84%
you're like, oh,
because then they

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:28.760 align:middle line:84%
can hang the whole rest of the
thing on that one little bit

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.560 align:middle line:90%
of truth.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
particle of truth.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.609 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: And if a
government insider,

00:17:33.609 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:84%
or somebody that says they
are and can prove it to you,

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.024 align:middle line:84%
because they'll tell you
something that most people

00:17:38.024 --> 00:17:40.465 align:middle line:84%
don't know and you can
check it out yourself--

00:17:40.465 --> 00:17:41.840 align:middle line:84%
if they come to
you and they say,

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
something about the UFO field

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.130 align:middle line:84%
or about UFOs that
nobody else knows,

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.950 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
having exclusive access

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:49.980 align:middle line:90%
to this information.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be your conduit
for this information-- me

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.480 align:middle line:90%
and maybe a group of people.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Huge ego flattering,
and then it doesn't even

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:84%
matter what they say anymore,
because that person feels

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:90%
like, hey I'm special.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you can feel-- if that
person can keep you on the

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.730 align:middle line:84%
"I feel like I'm special
and I'm getting information

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.400 align:middle line:84%
that nobody else is,"
it doesn't matter

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.880 align:middle line:84%
if it's true or false-- they're
going to keep spreading it.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's the
first thing I warn people.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who says they're the
only one in the know, run.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.030 align:middle line:90%
Don't listen.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's BS.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, exactly.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.490 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I'm more
interested in people

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.810 align:middle line:90%
that quietly tell me things.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.140 align:middle line:90%
It's like, did you hear this?

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.241 align:middle line:90%
Did you have any--

00:18:23.241 --> 00:18:25.240 align:middle line:84%
some-- a friend of mine
will come to me and say,

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.280 align:middle line:90%
have you heard about this?

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.110 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of it?

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: And it's not on the
shows, it's not in the news.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's written
articles about it,

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:90%
but we'll check with each other.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:34.490 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:35.780 align:middle line:90%
90% of that stuff--

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:36.580 align:middle line:90%
more than that.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.740 align:middle line:84%
95% of that stuff turns
out to be nothing.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.540 align:middle line:84%
But these interactions
with people--

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.420 align:middle line:84%
you know, with these people--
these sub rosa interactions,

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.836 align:middle line:84%
it adds to my understanding
personally, which as like I

00:18:46.836 --> 00:18:48.710 align:middle line:84%
said earlier, that's
kind of why I'm into it.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to get
some understanding.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.649 align:middle line:84%
And if I frame as
understanding and not answers,

00:18:53.649 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:84%
I think you learn a lot more,
because if you're looking

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.106 align:middle line:90%
for an answer, what happens?

00:18:57.106 --> 00:19:00.919 align:middle line:84%
You start narrowing down to,
what answers my question?

00:19:00.919 --> 00:19:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're looking
for evidence to support

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.340 align:middle line:90%
your belief.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: No, I'm looking
for understanding--

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, I'm saying
when you're doing that.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Oh, exactly.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're looking for
evidence to support what you

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:10.300 align:middle line:90%
believe to be true.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.545 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, and
you get blinders.

00:19:11.545 --> 00:19:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: And you don't--
you might miss something very

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:84%
important, because you
just filtered that out,

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.110 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't answer this
question that you have that

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.400 align:middle line:90%
the answer is encoded within.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, this brings up
just so many questions.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.920 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.802 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have a
script here and we've

00:19:25.802 --> 00:19:27.260 align:middle line:84%
got to get around
to Paul Bennewitz

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and what happened there,
because that actually

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:29.790 align:middle line:90%
flows into something else.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:30.560 align:middle line:90%
But I can't help asking--

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Ready for anything.

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.915 align:middle line:84%
So your perspective--
Project Serpo.

00:19:34.915 --> 00:19:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: I can't even
remember what year that was.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Early 2000s, I think.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: 2005,
2004, something--

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.119 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Yeah,
something like that.

00:19:41.119 --> 00:19:45.320 align:middle line:84%
A story came out
and this eventually

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle line:84%
ended up on "Coast to Coast" and
all of the shows and all that--

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:52.670 align:middle line:84%
was that there was an exchange
program sometime in the 1970s,

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:56.330 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was, where
aliens left a few aliens here

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and some astronauts went to
another planet in an exchange

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.360 align:middle line:84%
program, a la
"Close Encounters,"

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.950 align:middle line:84%
like the end of
"Close Encounters."

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Zeta
Reticuli, I think.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.570 align:middle line:10%
And that Zeta
Reticuli thing started

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:11.270 align:middle line:10%
because of the Barney and Betty
Hill thing and the Marjorie

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.910 align:middle line:10%
Fish star map where she said,
"I think it's Zeta Reticuli."

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.770 align:middle line:10%
So all the-- a
lot of the stories

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.080 align:middle line:10%
got pointed towards
Zeta Reticuli.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.840 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, the gist of it
was these two astronauts

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.320 align:middle line:10%
went to the planet Serpo
for nine years or something

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.834 align:middle line:10%
and returned--

00:20:25.834 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:10%
some of them returned.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.020 align:middle line:90%
A couple of them stayed there.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.390 align:middle line:84%
I think one of them
died on the planet,

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and then the aliens
went back to--

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: One died
in space [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.745 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, or
something like that.

00:20:33.745 --> 00:20:35.850 align:middle line:84%
One of them went
back to our planet.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.930 align:middle line:84%
One, it sounds totally
ridiculous to me.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Two, and even more important,
there's absolutely zero way

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:90%
to prove this happened.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And three, why would
they even-- why

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.170 align:middle line:90%
would somebody be saying this?

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:84%
I talked to a few
people that I knew,

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and they said, well this has
basically all the earmarks

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.820 align:middle line:90%
of an intel operation--

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.034 align:middle line:84%
basically to pass
messages back and forth.

00:20:58.034 --> 00:20:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And this was proven
to me, really,

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:01.605 align:middle line:84%
because the guy that
they had at first doing--

00:21:01.605 --> 00:21:04.220 align:middle line:84%
in the email list,
spreading these stories--

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.832 align:middle line:84%
Victor Martinez-- he
was an English teacher.

00:21:06.832 --> 00:21:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was going
to say, a schoolteacher.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: And I think he
was an English teacher,

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.000 align:middle line:84%
but anyway, they would send
him these things, that-- you

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:90%
know, like, you're the guy.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have you
spread this incredible story.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.990 align:middle line:84%
But the messages went out
and he started editing

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.500 align:middle line:90%
them, because they--

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:84%
the punctuation was wrong,
they had some wrong spellings,

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:26.300 align:middle line:90%
the grammar, and all that--

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And they told him please
do not change any of this.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.240 align:middle line:84%
We do not want you to change
any of what we've written.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.580 align:middle line:84%
We don't care if it sounds
better the way you wrote it

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:35.695 align:middle line:90%
or if there is--

00:21:35.695 --> 00:21:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and the only reason
I could think

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.430 align:middle line:84%
of after talking to people
about this a little bit was--

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:41.780 align:middle line:90%
some people in the know--

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.990 align:middle line:84%
was that if you're trying to
send a message to somebody

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.750 align:middle line:84%
in some coded way,
everything in that message

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:50.060 align:middle line:84%
is very important, or at
least certain parts of it

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.120 align:middle line:90%
are, to decode the message.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Somebody was trying to
communicate something

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.434 align:middle line:84%
through the UFO community, find
out who was interested in it,

00:21:58.434 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and find out if they
were trying to decode it.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.266 align:middle line:84%
And if they did decode
it, they could find out

00:22:02.266 --> 00:22:04.400 align:middle line:84%
who had decoded it,
because they'd find it

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.850 align:middle line:90%
in their intel traffic--

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:06.650 align:middle line:90%
you know, in--

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the story was
released with an intended kind

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:12.371 align:middle line:90%
of recipient on the other end.

00:22:12.371 --> 00:22:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, I think.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.980 align:middle line:84%
It was either released as--
with a recipient on the end,

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.740 align:middle line:84%
or as an attempt to
see who was interested,

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:84%
and if they could figure out
the code, who those people were,

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.490 align:middle line:84%
because they most certainly
weren't UFO researchers.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Hmm.

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: You know.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that's
interesting because again,

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:90%
it seems that Intelligence--

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:35.160 align:middle line:84%
if you go to the
Stephenville event, right?

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Mm-hmm.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what Ken Cherry
is saying is that Intelligence

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:84%
is really more interested in
the people that are interested

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:90%
in this phenomena--

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Exactly.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --and
how to manipulate--

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: And who they know.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Who knows who and how
you manipulate perception, too.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, exactly.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And manipulating
perception away from what

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.090 align:middle line:84%
they don't want people to look
at, which is probably some--

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.640 align:middle line:84%
again, a-- either
an intel operation,

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.480 align:middle line:84%
some kind of exotic technology,
or like aircraft or something

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.280 align:middle line:90%
like that--

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.380 align:middle line:84%
just something
you're working on.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Some people know about it, some
foreign powers know about it,

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.950 align:middle line:84%
but you want to know which
foreign powers and who

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:14.870 align:middle line:84%
in that chain is
sending that information

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.570 align:middle line:84%
to the foreign powers, because
then you can find those people,

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:18.870 align:middle line:90%
grab them and arrest them.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: And shut off
that information conduit

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.890 align:middle line:90%
to a hostile foreign power.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:28.340 align:middle line:84%
That makes sense, and certainly
the public perception part

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.420 align:middle line:90%
makes sense--

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.870 align:middle line:84%
is they can either participate
in an event with exotic

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:36.680 align:middle line:84%
technologies and then plant
information that this was

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.110 align:middle line:84%
an actual visitation
from elsewhere,

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.450 align:middle line:84%
just to see how the public's--
and that was what I found

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:43.820 align:middle line:84%
interesting about Stephenville,
to watch how the public would

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.070 align:middle line:84%
respond, because they went
in and immediately started

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.820 align:middle line:90%
investigating the people.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Right.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now-- and it was
a psychological profiling

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:53.800 align:middle line:90%
of the person.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's fascinating.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So in your opinion, if it's
being used in this way--

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.780 align:middle line:84%
if events, you know, are
being used in this way,

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.900 align:middle line:84%
what would you guess to
be perhaps one or more

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.700 align:middle line:90%
of the agendas involved?

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: My only thinking
on the agenda is, one,

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.489 align:middle line:90%
like I said, to--

00:24:13.489 --> 00:24:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Besides fleshing
people out that may be able

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:16.090 align:middle line:90%
to discern--

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:17.048 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Right, right.

00:24:17.048 --> 00:24:18.695 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The average person.

00:24:18.695 --> 00:24:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: From my
perspective, I don't really

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.310 align:middle line:84%
think that most people
in government care

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:84%
what the average person
thinks, unless it has something

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:30.920 align:middle line:84%
to do with the power structure
or Defense, or Intelligence.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, I don't really
think the people in power

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.390 align:middle line:90%
really--

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:37.848 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Then why would they
go to the trouble to analyze

00:24:37.848 --> 00:24:42.140 align:middle line:84%
and collect data on the
way people felt when they

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.165 align:middle line:90%
experience this?

00:24:43.165 --> 00:24:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Because it's
useful data that can be used

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:46.200 align:middle line:84%
for something else,
whether it be for--

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I'm asking.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.022 align:middle line:90%
It can be used for--

00:24:49.022 --> 00:24:50.480 align:middle line:84%
what happens to
people when they're

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.460 align:middle line:84%
faced with something
that is either unknown

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.380 align:middle line:84%
or there's a belief
system already in place?

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.830 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:57.288 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: And let's find out
what happens in real time with

00:24:57.288 --> 00:25:00.350 align:middle line:10%
this, and we can use it either
for another operation or if you

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:01.850 align:middle line:10%
really want it to
be conspiratorial,

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.940 align:middle line:10%
if they have to reveal
something that's--

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.672 align:middle line:10%
that they have no control over
that's not human, which I think

00:25:06.672 --> 00:25:07.880 align:middle line:10%
there is something like that.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.160 align:middle line:10%
I just don't know
what form it takes.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And we can get into
that later, but it's a--

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.666 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, go ahead, because
that makes perfect sense to me.

00:25:14.666 --> 00:25:17.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm more interested
in human sovereignty.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:20.580 align:middle line:84%
I do not like agendas being
perpetuated against humanity.

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.610 align:middle line:84%
I do not like mass
manipulation of humanity.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Right.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So I'm interested
at that higher level,

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and so I'm interested to
know what you have to say.

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Well, my idea
is what's going on is that

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:35.109 align:middle line:84%
the government, or whatever
the power structure is--

00:25:35.109 --> 00:25:36.650 align:middle line:84%
maybe not invested
in the government,

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:40.200 align:middle line:84%
but most people watching this
already believe that or realize

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.870 align:middle line:90%
it--

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:44.379 align:middle line:84%
I think that they
know that there

00:25:44.379 --> 00:25:46.920 align:middle line:84%
is something going on that's
not human that interacts with us

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.760 align:middle line:90%
occasionally.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.500 align:middle line:10%
I'm pretty sure
that's happening.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.482 align:middle line:10%
I could be wrong, but all
evidence and everybody I've

00:25:52.482 --> 00:25:54.690 align:middle line:10%
talked to, and all the
literature and all that points

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:56.231 align:middle line:10%
to there's something
that's not human

00:25:56.231 --> 00:25:59.270 align:middle line:10%
that's doing stuff
with us occasionally.

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think our audience
that's watching right now is

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:02.580 align:middle line:90%
comfortable with that.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean,
they might not like it.

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:04.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying they're comfortable
with that assumption.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going--

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't really go any further
than that because then I

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.660 align:middle line:90%
start making assumptions.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: But I think that the
power structure knows this.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.980 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
what to do about it,

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.840 align:middle line:84%
they don't know
how to control it,

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:84%
but they do know how to control
people's perception of it.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:24.930 align:middle line:10%
There's not too many--

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:27.360 align:middle line:10%
I don't think a majority of
the population, or at least

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.440 align:middle line:10%
the people that have any
kind of say in anything--

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.740 align:middle line:10%
I don't think that they're
on board with that idea.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Like if you're a scientist
or an academician,

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.572 align:middle line:84%
or just people who determine
what we think is real--

00:26:41.572 --> 00:26:43.030 align:middle line:84%
they're not on
board with that yet.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.420 align:middle line:84%
There's probably far more
people in the population that

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.100 align:middle line:84%
are on board with it than
the people that are probably

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.530 align:middle line:90%
telling us what we should think.

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.130 align:middle line:90%
The quote "authorities."

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.220 align:middle line:84%
So as long as those
people who are

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.860 align:middle line:90%
in charge of making sure that--

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.780 align:middle line:84%
what our reality
is supposed to be--

00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:84%
as long as those
people don't really

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:02.229 align:middle line:84%
think there's anything to the
subject, there's no problem.

00:27:02.229 --> 00:27:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, I'm always
interested in, why do they want

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:05.570 align:middle line:90%
to know that?

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:08.040 align:middle line:84%
What is it they're going to
try to manipulate with that?

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.721 align:middle line:90%
That's always a concern.

00:27:09.721 --> 00:27:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the
right hand often

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.928 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know what the
left hand is doing,

00:27:12.928 --> 00:27:14.960 align:middle line:84%
but there are specific
projects where

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.510 align:middle line:84%
a plan is rolled out from
manipulations-- you know,

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:18.590 align:middle line:90%
perception.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, and
I think it's usually

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:middle line:84%
having to do with
normal, mundane things

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:90%
that we all know about.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: But for not normal,
non-mundane things that we

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:30.780 align:middle line:84%
don't know about, I think if
it becomes obvious to people

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.187 align:middle line:84%
that something's going
on, which with the way

00:27:33.187 --> 00:27:34.770 align:middle line:84%
our brains are made
up now and the way

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:36.600 align:middle line:84%
we deal with things,
the way our lives are,

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we can perceive
this weirdness in the way that

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:42.150 align:middle line:90%
is close to what it is.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:46.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know what it
is, but I think it's low

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.860 align:middle line:84%
on the agenda because it's just
not something that's-- it might

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:50.831 align:middle line:90%
be on the horizon--

00:27:50.831 --> 00:27:52.330 align:middle line:84%
where somebody has
to say something.

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:53.664 align:middle line:90%
Say look, this is what this is.

00:27:53.664 --> 00:27:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what is your
perception of disclosure?

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:58.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to Steven Greer.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:01.070 align:middle line:84%
As to begin, because he
did the first disclosure.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.440 align:middle line:84%
My perception of at
least the concept

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.930 align:middle line:84%
that people like Steven
Greer and Steve Bassett

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:12.630 align:middle line:84%
have as disclosure is, you
are asking for something

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:84%
that if you get the answer and
it's not the answer you want,

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.250 align:middle line:90%
you're going to cry cover up.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:18.050 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:19.689 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's
a no-win situation.

00:28:19.689 --> 00:28:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: It's a no-win
situation for them.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.896 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like,
I'm going to go

00:28:22.896 --> 00:28:24.770 align:middle line:84%
to Dad, who I don't
trust with anything else

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and ask him to tell me
the truth about something.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.030 align:middle line:84%
That-- it's
cognitively dissonant,

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.259 align:middle line:84%
saying something
like that-- to me.

00:28:31.259 --> 00:28:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And yet at the
same time, I was also--

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I was present for
Disclosure in D.C. that day,

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and was behind the
scenes with them,

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and I did see these little
old men with their medals

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.766 align:middle line:84%
and epaulettes,
in tears-- shaking

00:28:45.766 --> 00:28:48.140 align:middle line:84%
because they were breaking
their National Security oaths.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Right.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.198 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: They
did know something,

00:28:50.198 --> 00:28:53.435 align:middle line:10%
and I believe they were telling
what they knew to be true.

00:28:53.435 --> 00:28:54.235 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Right.

00:28:54.235 --> 00:28:54.755 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And so--

00:28:54.755 --> 00:28:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: I don't know.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.495 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I trust them,
but I wasn't there,

00:28:57.495 --> 00:28:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and there's no way for me to
confirm what they're saying,

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:01.565 align:middle line:90%
except that they're--

00:29:01.565 --> 00:29:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: But I'm saying--

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: They're supposedly
trustworthy people.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, let's say
most of these witnesses,

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.190 align:middle line:90%
which that--

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:09.860 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot done
to really ferret out

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.390 align:middle line:90%
those particular witnesses.

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Again, Danny Sheehan's
name comes up

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:14.765 align:middle line:84%
because he was part of
the ferreting process.

00:29:14.765 --> 00:29:15.689 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:29:15.689 --> 00:29:18.230 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So what happens when
you have a collective of them

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:22.640 align:middle line:10%
that come up and they have 10 to
15 minutes to tell their truth

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:27.050 align:middle line:10%
in front of this audience--
a roomful of reporters?

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:32.540 align:middle line:84%
What is, in the highest sense,
the best that can come of that?

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.460 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: Opening
the door another 1/16

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.410 align:middle line:10%
of an inch of a
crack with people

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:37.950 align:middle line:10%
who are on the fence about it.

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:40.940 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: That's kind of what
I think Danny Sheehan would say

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:41.840 align:middle line:10%
also on that.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, and--

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
really not-- there--

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:47.630 align:middle line:84%
everyone's so hopeful that
the day of disclosure--

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:48.920 align:middle line:90%
that was disclosure.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:49.235 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:29:49.235 --> 00:29:50.966 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: That was a
huge disclosure by a lot

00:29:50.966 --> 00:29:50.990 align:middle line:10%
of military--

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:52.220 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, well,
it's already happened,

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:52.800 align:middle line:10%
and it's really not
affected anything.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.360 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: It's
already happened.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.212 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing--

00:29:54.212 --> 00:29:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: I
interviewed-- no matter

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:58.211 align:middle line:84%
what you think of Grant Cameron,
I interviewed him on my show

00:29:58.211 --> 00:30:01.280 align:middle line:84%
once about four or five years
ago, and the title of the show

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.210 align:middle line:84%
was "Disclosures
Happened Already."

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I keep saying.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:04.610 align:middle line:90%
It's already-- it's done.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:04.700 align:middle line:90%
It's happened.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.783 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: So it doesn't
really-- it doesn't really

00:30:06.783 --> 00:30:10.430 align:middle line:84%
matter to a lot of people,
and you know, at this point

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:14.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking the only way to get
more people thinking that this

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:16.790 align:middle line:84%
is a real thing, or at
least it is something

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:20.090 align:middle line:84%
that we shouldn't ignore,
or think that it's not real,

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:24.499 align:middle line:84%
is to get people to
experience it individually.

00:30:24.499 --> 00:30:26.290 align:middle line:84%
But that's a tough one
too, because there's

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:27.490 align:middle line:90%
so much cultural baggage.

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:28.990 align:middle line:10%
If somebody has a
weird experience,

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.210 align:middle line:10%
what basket do you think
they're going to put it in?

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:31.570 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:33.736 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: Oh, it's aliens
coming from other planets.

00:30:33.736 --> 00:30:34.537 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:30:34.537 --> 00:30:37.077 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: And that's hard to--
it's hard to get that idea out

00:30:37.077 --> 00:30:38.110 align:middle line:10%
of people's mind.

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I had a guy in my show,
Jeff Ritzmann and he said,

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.790 align:middle line:84%
there is a way to have-- and
this is separate from the CE-5

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:45.139 align:middle line:90%
Steven Greer stuff--

00:30:45.139 --> 00:30:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Explain what
CE-5 protocols are.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: It is a
way that they say

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:53.500 align:middle line:84%
that they can call
in UFOs and ETs

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.920 align:middle line:84%
to come and make an
appearance on command.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.721 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:30:57.721 --> 00:30:59.345 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: And I've
heard people tell me

00:30:59.345 --> 00:31:00.405 align:middle line:90%
that stuff has happened.

00:31:00.405 --> 00:31:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Like they get
lights and things like that.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:02.655 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They do.

00:31:02.655 --> 00:31:02.930 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: I would
love to see that.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:05.420 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
see it for myself.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Truly not as
dramatic as you expect it to be,

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.410 align:middle line:90%
but there'll be--

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.076 align:middle line:84%
there often is a
little something, yeah.

00:31:10.076 --> 00:31:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, I mean, I would
love to see it for myself.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.119 align:middle line:84%
And if I did, I'm sure I'd say
that was interesting and wow,

00:31:16.119 --> 00:31:18.160 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to take this
further, but not in the way

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.510 align:middle line:90%
they're telling me.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:23.230 align:middle line:84%
This-- my friend Jeff Ritzmann
on my show, and I said,

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.930 align:middle line:84%
"So if you think we should
be doing this ourselves,

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:30.269 align:middle line:84%
which I think, on a
very democratic level--"

00:31:30.269 --> 00:31:32.560 align:middle line:84%
there was a story in a Whitley
Strieber book, he said--

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.150 align:middle line:84%
in the 1950s, they
were saying that--

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:35.950 align:middle line:90%
oh, no, no.

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:36.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:39.070 align:middle line:84%
His visitors told him--
whatever you think of Strieber.

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.640 align:middle line:90%
I like him.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.440 align:middle line:90%
I like his ideas.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like being an artist
and playing with ideas,

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.920 align:middle line:84%
because he is an
artist, as a writer.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.900 align:middle line:90%
But he said that the idea was--

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.080 align:middle line:84%
from his visitors, he said,
the most democratic way

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.870 align:middle line:84%
possible-- contact people
individually and have

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:57.220 align:middle line:84%
their individual reactions be
the disclosure or the contact,

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.630 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to call it.

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:00.430 align:middle line:90%
So I went--

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:01.570 align:middle line:90%
I was asking Jeff this.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.490 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Well, what do you do?"

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Well, I
do have a method,

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:06.520 align:middle line:84%
I probably shouldn't
talk about it."

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.212 align:middle line:90%
"Well, why not, Jeff?"

00:32:08.212 --> 00:32:10.420 align:middle line:84%
"Well, it might-- something--
something wrong might--

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.253 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like playing
with a Ouija board.

00:32:12.253 --> 00:32:15.450 align:middle line:84%
People say calling in things
you don't understand."

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "We're
adults here, Jeff.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.450 align:middle line:84%
If somebody has a problem and
they come back and blame us

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:23.977 align:middle line:84%
for it, what are
they, five years old?

00:32:23.977 --> 00:32:25.310 align:middle line:90%
You can make your own decision."

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: So I said, "So spill.

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:29.550 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?"

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:32.670 align:middle line:90%
He said, "Go out to a place--

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.820 align:middle line:84%
a dark place in the country at
the same time every evening--

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.530 align:middle line:90%
maybe not too late.

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Set aside time for
this and imagine

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:43.620 align:middle line:84%
what might-- what you
might want to see.

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:44.790 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it might be.

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself why
you're out there.

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:49.665 align:middle line:84%
Very, very-- ask--
your own motivations--

00:32:49.665 --> 00:32:51.380 align:middle line:84%
you just have to be
aware of that, too."

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
very intelligent.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- I said,
"So what happens?"

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:58.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, "About 40%
to 60% of the time,

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:01.950 align:middle line:84%
whoever I'm talking
to, something happens.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:04.444 align:middle line:84%
And it's never what they
expect, and it's never--

00:33:04.444 --> 00:33:06.610 align:middle line:84%
never happens when they
think it's going to happen."

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:07.500 align:middle line:90%
It's like hauntings, you know.

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.340 align:middle line:84%
If you're sitting there waiting
for something to happen,

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:09.660 align:middle line:90%
doesn't happen.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.700 align:middle line:84%
When you're walking
down the hall,

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.222 align:middle line:84%
then a glass flies
in front of you.

00:33:12.222 --> 00:33:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: So I said, "Well,
so what, for example?"

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:15.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Well,
somebody was saying

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I want to see a big ship
come with all these lights."

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.770 align:middle line:84%
They do that for four,
five, six, eight, 10 nights.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And then on the
11th night, he says

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.350 align:middle line:84%
a big black shape goes
across their field of vision,

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.530 align:middle line:90%
and they go, whoa.

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said that's the
kind of stuff that happens.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And at this
conference in Roswell,

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:35.970 align:middle line:84%
I was with a group of
people who were saying,

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:38.220 align:middle line:84%
no, well this-- you don't
know what you're calling up.

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.595 align:middle line:84%
It could be demonic
and all this.

00:33:39.595 --> 00:33:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, I'm going
to quote Jacques Vallee.

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:45.570 align:middle line:84%
He was speaking to Jerome
Clark many years ago--

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:47.330 align:middle line:84%
I think in the '90s
in an interview,

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and he said, "You
can study volcanoes

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.130 align:middle line:84%
all you want from 10 miles
away, but you're never

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:53.549 align:middle line:84%
going to learn
everything there is

00:33:53.549 --> 00:33:56.090 align:middle line:84%
to know about volcanoes unless
you go up and stand next to it

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.750 align:middle line:90%
once in a while."

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:57.551 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:33:57.551 --> 00:33:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: So-- and then I
get the further argument

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.370 align:middle line:90%
from people.

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:03.890 align:middle line:84%
"Well, aren't you opening
the door to something

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:04.940 align:middle line:90%
that might harm people?"

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:05.740 align:middle line:90%
And all this.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:06.590 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you--

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:09.150 align:middle line:84%
I said, only certain people
should probably be doing this,

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:11.090 align:middle line:84%
and I think they probably
know who they are.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:14.880 align:middle line:84%
For an example, you wouldn't
send just anybody to the moon,

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.350 align:middle line:84%
but you would send
Neil Armstrong,

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:18.600 align:middle line:84%
because he has the training,
he knows what he's doing,

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:23.090 align:middle line:84%
he can handle the pressure,
and he's uniquely qualified

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:24.484 align:middle line:90%
to do something like that.

00:34:24.484 --> 00:34:26.150 align:middle line:84%
That's what I think
should be happening,

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and if you can get to that
point and spread this to people

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and get them to experience
something for themselves

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.750 align:middle line:84%
without putting a
meaning on it, I

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:39.830 align:middle line:84%
think that will start to
grow some sort of awareness.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And then no matter what
the news says, or no matter

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.280 align:middle line:84%
what a skeptic
says, or no matter

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.139 align:middle line:84%
what a scientist who thinks they
know without looking into it

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:51.650 align:middle line:84%
themselves that, it doesn't
make any difference anymore,

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:53.659 align:middle line:84%
because people that have had
the thing happen to them,

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:55.533 align:middle line:84%
you can't tell them it
didn't happen to them.

00:34:55.533 --> 00:34:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Something happened, definitely,
that doesn't make any sense

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.082 align:middle line:84%
and they have to make
sense of it in their lives.

00:35:00.082 --> 00:35:02.498 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That makes sense,
and that's really what's kind

00:35:02.498 --> 00:35:04.490 align:middle line:84%
of fun about James
Gilliland's place--

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:07.832 align:middle line:84%
every now and then in the summer
when he has a group together,

00:35:07.832 --> 00:35:10.040 align:middle line:84%
people get together and they
put their intention out,

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and some pretty
crazy stuff happens.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:11.890 align:middle line:90%
And they capture it on camera.

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Yeah, I talked
to somebody that just went.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:16.066 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and it's
always fun because it seems that

00:35:16.066 --> 00:35:18.570 align:middle line:84%
it's almost a
festive atmosphere.

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not terribly serious.

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:21.600 align:middle line:90%
You just-- you're out there.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.699 align:middle line:84%
You've already done your
marshmallow roasting

00:35:23.699 --> 00:35:24.990 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you're going to do.

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.260 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And you
have kids and families,

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:32.270 align:middle line:10%
and it seems like he does end
up kind of attracting a certain

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:35.820 align:middle line:10%
amount of kind of almost happy--

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:38.200 align:middle line:10%
kind of happy observations
where flashing lights

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:38.420 align:middle line:10%
and coming in close.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: I want to go there.

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:40.340 align:middle line:90%
I want to see that.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I think he's probably built too
much of his ego up around it,

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:46.090 align:middle line:90%
although that doesn't--

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:48.550 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't cover up the fact
that people see things there.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: I talked to a
MUFON representative who

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:53.880 align:middle line:84%
recently resigned
from MUFON, and he

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.130 align:middle line:90%
says, "I've been there before.

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:57.050 align:middle line:10%
There have been lights there
since before he was even

00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.380 align:middle line:10%
there."

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: That is-- it's a
place like the Marfa lights are

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:00.540 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, as--

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Mt.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:01.280 align:middle line:90%
Adams.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And he says he's there
because it is Mt.

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Adams, that it seems
to be attracting

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:09.230 align:middle line:84%
these particular vehicles
and entities, whatever.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:11.000 align:middle line:90%
And so yeah, I'd encourage it.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a fun experience.

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.961 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: I also like to
talk to different people.

00:36:14.961 --> 00:36:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I like to talk to a
very skeptical person.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I like to talk to somebody who
totally believes that there's

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:19.300 align:middle line:90%
aliens coming here.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.327 align:middle line:84%
I like to talk to somebody
that has no idea, just to see--

00:36:22.327 --> 00:36:23.660 align:middle line:90%
and they all see the same thing.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.090 align:middle line:84%
I want to see what their
descriptions of it are.

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:27.650 align:middle line:10%
Because I think
it really depends

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:30.347 align:middle line:10%
on psychedelic set and setting.

00:36:30.347 --> 00:36:31.805 align:middle line:10%
What do you bring
to the experience

00:36:31.805 --> 00:36:36.650 align:middle line:10%
and how does that affect what
you see and what you remember?

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.766 align:middle line:10%
And what what's happening when
the experience is going on?

00:36:39.766 --> 00:36:41.390 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Spoken as
a true researcher.

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What about the
whole thing with night goggles?

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Night vision goggles, military?

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Where people see incredibly
strange things through those?

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I've never had the
chance to do that.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:54.870 align:middle line:90%
But I've seen the images.

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:55.670 align:middle line:90%
I've seen pictures.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:59.690 align:middle line:90%
And weird things show up.

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:01.005 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what they are.

00:37:01.005 --> 00:37:03.380 align:middle line:84%
They might have to do with
the secret space program thing

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.736 align:middle line:84%
that I think is blown
way out of proportion.

00:37:05.736 --> 00:37:07.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there's
things in space.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.390 align:middle line:84%
We don't know about
that the government

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and other governments
have launched.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.240 align:middle line:10%
There's got to be.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.997 align:middle line:10%
I mean, if you could do that
and you could have an advantage

00:37:13.997 --> 00:37:15.830 align:middle line:10%
and not tell anybody,
of course you'd do it.

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:18.290 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that too
many assumptions, I think,

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:19.440 align:middle line:90%
are made about that.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think some of what these
people are seeing, obviously,

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:24.060 align:middle line:84%
are these things that they don't
normally want people to see.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.600 align:middle line:84%
But they were launching them
before people had night vision

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and were able to
see these things.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And they're just going
to be silent about it.

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
have to figure out

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.720 align:middle line:84%
a way to cover them up
now people can see them

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.520 align:middle line:90%
with night vision.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.985 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was going to say,
that's what's interesting is

00:37:34.985 --> 00:37:35.660 align:middle line:90%
the lid's kind of blown off.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:38.034 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Or it's important
that some people do see them.

00:37:38.034 --> 00:37:39.290 align:middle line:90%
That might be part of--

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.730 align:middle line:90%
that might be useful as well.

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:43.063 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Because there will
be certain inquiring minds

00:37:43.063 --> 00:37:45.541 align:middle line:10%
and minds that know how to
interpret that can start

00:37:45.541 --> 00:37:47.290 align:middle line:10%
bringing a new part
of the story together.

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:47.700 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:48.908 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Well, you're right.

00:37:48.908 --> 00:37:51.730 align:middle line:84%
But I was saying from the
government's point of view,

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:53.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, let some of
this stuff get out.

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what
they say about it.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what the person
from another government says.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:57.966 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what China says.

00:37:57.966 --> 00:37:59.090 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what Russia says.

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what they're-- now
that it's kind of an open

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:04.700 align:middle line:84%
secret, let's use
that to our advantage.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:07.010 align:middle line:90%
Night goggles.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:10.910 align:middle line:84%
I live in Sedona, so UFO
viewing is part of the culture.

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:14.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a nighttime
activity option.

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:16.462 align:middle line:10%
There was one film
I saw years ago

00:38:16.462 --> 00:38:18.170 align:middle line:10%
that you may have
seen, "The Secret Space

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:19.162 align:middle line:10%
Transmissions" with--

00:38:19.162 --> 00:38:20.120 align:middle line:10%
I think it was Martyn--

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.080 align:middle line:10%
Martyn Stubbs.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Really?

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:22.220 align:middle line:90%
Never seen it.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh it is--

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Great.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:24.810 align:middle line:90%
Now I've got to watch that.

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now you
have to watch it.

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:28.520 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating
if you can find it.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.900 align:middle line:90%
The quality's not that great.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.560 align:middle line:90%
But during one of the missions--

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember which
mission it was, honestly,

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:37.100 align:middle line:90%
space mission.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:42.680 align:middle line:10%
He was working at a
public access TV station,

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:43.710 align:middle line:10%
I believe in Vancouver.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:45.500 align:middle line:10%
It was in BC, Canada.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And he started pulling in the
signal from NASA accidentally.

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And he started
recording everything.

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:53.434 align:middle line:10%
And when you look at
that, I mean, to me,

00:38:53.434 --> 00:38:54.850 align:middle line:10%
I think everybody
should watch it.

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:57.110 align:middle line:84%
It's really fun and
fascinating when

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:01.160 align:middle line:84%
you see just the bizarre-looking
stuff that was shown.

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.590 align:middle line:84%
All of it then, anything
that was shown to the public,

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:06.010 align:middle line:84%
of course, as other
testimony, disclosure,

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:07.220 align:middle line:90%
that stuff's scrubbed.

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.300 align:middle line:90%
Images are scrubbed.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And there are teams of people
that are there to do that.

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:13.580 align:middle line:84%
So you would never
see these odd shapes,

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.550 align:middle line:84%
massive cigars
floating through space,

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:17.610 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of weird stuff.

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: I'd like to see it.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:21.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've seen a lot of these
videos and, to me, most of it

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.990 align:middle line:84%
can be put down to stuff
floating close of the camera.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:25.970 align:middle line:84%
But there's other things,
like the thing that

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:26.900 align:middle line:90%
comes up through the clouds.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.250 align:middle line:84%
It's the launch from
wherever it was,

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:29.970 align:middle line:84%
South America, then it
shoots off into space.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:30.771 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:39:30.771 --> 00:39:32.353 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: I don't
know about that one.

00:39:32.353 --> 00:39:33.650 align:middle line:90%
That one's very strange to me.

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:36.625 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's aliens or
a secret space program or what.

00:39:36.625 --> 00:39:38.937 align:middle line:84%
But it's anomalous and very
strange and interesting.

00:39:38.937 --> 00:39:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so I mean, I
think it's wonderful to have

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:45.480 align:middle line:84%
a childlike curiosity and be
open to all of these things.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:50.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't like the implications of
manipulating human perception.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.800 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
I'm interested.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.344 align:middle line:10%
So this is a good time to
get into Paul Bennewitz now,

00:39:54.344 --> 00:39:55.760 align:middle line:10%
kind of backtracking
a little bit.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And you already talked
about him with Moore.

00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:01.040 align:middle line:84%
The book project beta
was about Paul Bennewitz.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And the upshot of it was that he
was encouraged in his delusions

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:09.800 align:middle line:84%
about what he was seeing
near a military base

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and secret projects, to
the point where he ended up

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.110 align:middle line:84%
in his family put him
in a mental health

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:17.630 align:middle line:84%
facility for a while,
for about three months.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:20.150 align:middle line:90%


00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:22.820 align:middle line:10%
What it was was he was
basically seeing things

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:26.387 align:middle line:10%
at Kirtland Air Force Base,
where secret things were

00:40:26.387 --> 00:40:27.470 align:middle line:10%
being tested all the time.

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:29.240 align:middle line:10%
I think they still are.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.500 align:middle line:90%
Reported it to the Air Force.

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.990 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force was very
interested because, well,

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.950 align:middle line:90%
what's he looking at?

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:36.080 align:middle line:84%
What's he telling--
who is he talking to?

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.900 align:middle line:90%
That was a very important one.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:43.367 align:middle line:10%
And let's start in
relationship with him,

00:40:43.367 --> 00:40:45.200 align:middle line:10%
keep him in our confidence
so he can tell us

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.660 align:middle line:10%
exactly what he's doing,
exactly what he's saying.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.700 align:middle line:10%
And we can keep track
on who he's talking to

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.800 align:middle line:10%
and what they're saying.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.627 align:middle line:84%
What happened was he kept
saying, I think this is aliens,

00:40:55.627 --> 00:40:57.210 align:middle line:84%
and getting a little
bit more and more

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:00.210 align:middle line:84%
ridiculous with the
stories, more outlandish.

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And the Air Force never
told him to back off.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:05.070 align:middle line:84%
They just kept encouraging
him because they

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:07.530 align:middle line:84%
didn't want anybody to
really take him seriously.

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.081 align:middle line:10%
However, the people that
did take him seriously, they

00:41:10.081 --> 00:41:12.330 align:middle line:10%
really wanted to know about
because they were probably

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:13.470 align:middle line:10%
people that we're
trying to figure out

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:15.960 align:middle line:10%
what was going on at the
base, like foreign nationals

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.800 align:middle line:10%
and spies.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.716 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:41:17.716 --> 00:41:19.140 align:middle line:90%
And also it's kind of--

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and it is one thought, and I
think a legitimate thought,

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:24.090 align:middle line:84%
that if you're going
to have UFO activity,

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:26.010 align:middle line:84%
the greatest saturation
would and should

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:27.550 align:middle line:90%
be around military bases.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:29.975 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: As a matter
of nothing else,

00:41:29.975 --> 00:41:33.240 align:middle line:84%
of curiosity as to what's going
on and what the implications

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.904 align:middle line:84%
are, especially since
we're rather aggressive.

00:41:35.904 --> 00:41:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Oh, I
see what you mean.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:40.770 align:middle line:84%
The high incidence
of UFO sightings

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:42.366 align:middle line:90%
around military bases.

00:41:42.366 --> 00:41:44.490 align:middle line:84%
You can go a couple of ways
with that-- either one,

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:47.100 align:middle line:84%
what you just said, or two,
there's a lot of weird stuff we

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:48.550 align:middle line:84%
don't know that's being
developed and they're--

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And they're
generating both.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.609 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Perfectly
happy to let everybody

00:41:51.609 --> 00:41:53.590 align:middle line:84%
think that it's aliens
from other planets.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I think it's
probably a combination of both.

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:58.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it
probably is too.

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Although I will reiterate
that I do not know what

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:02.820 align:middle line:84%
UFOs are and I do not
know what controls them

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:05.360 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And I actively fight
any belief system

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:08.995 align:middle line:84%
that I might have
that creeps in.

00:42:08.995 --> 00:42:09.795 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:09.795 --> 00:42:10.650 align:middle line:90%
OK, there you go.

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: I have militant
agnosticism about it.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.195 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Keep it pure.

00:42:15.195 --> 00:42:17.280 align:middle line:84%
So Bennewitz was kind
of going off the rails.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.835 align:middle line:84%
And what was he known for
in terms of his revelations

00:42:19.835 --> 00:42:21.866 align:middle line:90%
to the public?

00:42:21.866 --> 00:42:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: A lot of the--

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.110 align:middle line:84%
the book, the
subtitle of the book

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:31.047 align:middle line:84%
was "The Creation of
a Modern UFO Myth."

00:42:31.047 --> 00:42:32.880 align:middle line:84%
People will often say
the creation of "the."

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:33.600 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what are you saying?

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:34.660 align:middle line:90%
All UFOs are myths?

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:35.460 align:middle line:90%
I was like, no.

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.770 align:middle line:90%
It says "a"," not "the."

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:39.780 align:middle line:84%
The point was that
a lot of the stories

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:43.500 align:middle line:84%
about underground bases,
about abductions in exchange

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:50.070 align:middle line:84%
for technology, partially the
cattle mutilation mystery, all

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:56.010 align:middle line:84%
began with operations with
and against and involving

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Paul Bennewitz.

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:58.977 align:middle line:84%
And this was in the
late '70s, early '80s.

00:42:58.977 --> 00:43:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He was
disseminating all of that.

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And he was being
given that by intelligence

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:04.010 align:middle line:90%
as disinformation?

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Mostly his ideas,
some of it was either supported,

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.190 align:middle line:84%
and a very small
amount, I, think

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:15.770 align:middle line:84%
was given to him, especially
a computer that he had.

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:17.911 align:middle line:84%
And this was in the
late '70s, early '80s.

00:43:17.911 --> 00:43:18.910 align:middle line:90%
There were no computers.

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, not
personal, anyhow.

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: He was an
electrical engineer.

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:22.230 align:middle line:90%
He built his computers.

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:24.249 align:middle line:84%
He built the software
into the computers

00:43:24.249 --> 00:43:26.290 align:middle line:84%
because you couldn't load
software on a computer.

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:28.910 align:middle line:84%
The computer was made
for one task only.

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And you had to build
that task into it.

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:33.330 align:middle line:10%
A lot of the stories
that are still prevalent

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:37.320 align:middle line:10%
now about underground bases,
about abductions in exchange

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:41.190 align:middle line:10%
for technology, even some of
the cattle mutilation stuff

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:44.430 align:middle line:10%
had its genesis during
the Paul Bennewitz events

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:45.959 align:middle line:10%
in the late '70s, early '80s.

00:43:45.959 --> 00:43:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how much of
that was, do you think,

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.480 align:middle line:84%
planted information for him
to disinform from the public

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.140 align:middle line:90%
versus real?

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: It wasn't to
disinform the public.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.940 align:middle line:84%
It was to disinform
Paul Bennewitz,

00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:00.726 align:middle line:84%
so that he can remain
confused yet still interested

00:44:00.726 --> 00:44:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and tell them what
he was seeing.

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I see.

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:04.039 align:middle line:10%
But it caught hold.

00:44:04.039 --> 00:44:05.580 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: It did
catch hold, but they

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:08.197 align:middle line:10%
didn't expect that to happen.

00:44:08.197 --> 00:44:10.530 align:middle line:84%
They were just doing it for
Paul Bennewitz and everybody

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:10.620 align:middle line:90%
who knew.

00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To make
him sound nutty.

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.030 align:middle line:10%
Well, he was nutty
to begin with.

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:17.340 align:middle line:10%
But they just encouraged it.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.664 align:middle line:10%
And like I said, this was
an unethical thing to do.

00:44:19.664 --> 00:44:20.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't agree with it.

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And just because
I reported on it

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.510 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean I
think it was right.

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Even Bill Moore
admits at this point,

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and Richard Doughty, who was one
of the people at the Air Force,

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:32.640 align:middle line:84%
also says he feels
really bad about what

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.260 align:middle line:90%
happened to Bennewitz.

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And that they were
doing this to protect

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:40.840 align:middle line:90%
secret programs at the base.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Me, them, and everybody else
thinks they went probably

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:45.060 align:middle line:90%
a little bit too far with that.

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:47.771 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: They even
went to the point

00:44:47.771 --> 00:44:51.150 align:middle line:10%
of, when they really wanted
to take his attention away

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:55.080 align:middle line:10%
from the base, they flew
him up to near Dulce, which

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.260 align:middle line:10%
is a famous area, to look at
some stuff they had placed up

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.414 align:middle line:10%
on a hill to just basically
draw his attention away

00:45:00.414 --> 00:45:01.830 align:middle line:10%
from the base,
saying, look, Paul.

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:03.830 align:middle line:84%
I think there's something
very interesting here.

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:06.270 align:middle line:10%
And this actually did
happen because Bennewitz

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:09.570 align:middle line:10%
came back and told people,
researchers that were not

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:12.900 align:middle line:10%
in the Air Force or intel, such
as Gabe Valdez, the New Mexico

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.170 align:middle line:10%
State policeman, the
late Gabe Valdez,

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:19.444 align:middle line:10%
just encouraging his
attention away from the base.

00:45:19.444 --> 00:45:21.360 align:middle line:10%
The funny thing is when
he was up there flying

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.770 align:middle line:10%
around looking at
it one time, he

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:25.700 align:middle line:10%
saw something that
had crashed there.

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.824 align:middle line:10%
And it just happened to
crash right in that area

00:45:27.824 --> 00:45:28.740 align:middle line:10%
where they showed him.

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.240 align:middle line:10%
And he was a pilot,
a private pilot,

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.580 align:middle line:10%
so he was out there taking
pictures with a nice, very

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:34.950 align:middle line:10%
big, very clear picture camera.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:36.649 align:middle line:84%
And none of those
pictures survived

00:45:36.649 --> 00:45:38.940 align:middle line:84%
because somebody came into
his house and took them all.

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.398 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
always the story.

00:45:40.398 --> 00:45:42.420 align:middle line:84%
That always seems
to be the story.

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:45.220 align:middle line:84%
What about, though-- let's go to
underground bases for a moment.

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:46.470 align:middle line:90%
We have about 10 minutes left.

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:48.090 align:middle line:84%
I'll ask you a few
more questions.

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:51.570 align:middle line:10%
But the whole Phil Schneider
story, for example, and I

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:53.710 align:middle line:10%
remember going to one--

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:55.780 align:middle line:10%
I don't even remember
which conference it was.

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:58.080 align:middle line:10%
And there was an
engineer there, who

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.650 align:middle line:10%
was just kind of dry in his
presentation with his slide

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:03.479 align:middle line:10%
show about how this tunneling
technology works and how--

00:46:03.479 --> 00:46:04.520 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: Richard Sauder?

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:05.640 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Was it
Richard Sauder?

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.330 align:middle line:10%
It may have been.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.660 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: He wrote a book
called "Underground Bases

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:09.201 align:middle line:10%
and Tunnels," and
wrote a second one.

00:46:09.201 --> 00:46:10.234 align:middle line:10%
I used it as a source.

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:12.150 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: It must be
him because I remember--

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:13.170 align:middle line:10%
that name sounds familiar.

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:15.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm terrible with names,
but that sounds familiar.

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:16.256 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: S-A-U-D-E-R, yeah.

00:46:16.256 --> 00:46:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Just an engineer, just
explained this is how we do it,

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:21.120 align:middle line:84%
this is the
technology used, this

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.581 align:middle line:90%
is how far we can tell each day.

00:46:22.581 --> 00:46:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And he was just
explaining how they do it.

00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: These are
all open sources, too.

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.285 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: And these were
open sources 20 years ago.

00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:31.120 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And we know Jesse
Ventura in "Conspiracy Theory,"

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:31.920 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.386 align:middle line:10%
Going to the underground
base under the Denver airport

00:46:34.386 --> 00:46:35.760 align:middle line:10%
and all of that,
with the guards.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.110 align:middle line:10%
And so I think it's--

00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:39.949 align:middle line:10%
I mean, to me it certainly
seems whatever the agenda is

00:46:39.949 --> 00:46:41.490 align:middle line:10%
and what's going on
under there, they

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:43.620 align:middle line:10%
seem to exist, just by
open-- like you say,

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:44.970 align:middle line:10%
open source information.

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:46.590 align:middle line:10%
But what about Phil
Schneider, where

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:50.880 align:middle line:10%
there's an alien interface
with these bases?

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.130 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: I don't know what
to make of Phil Schneider.

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:56.130 align:middle line:10%
I talked to some people that--

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:59.680 align:middle line:10%
law enforcement people that
were contacted after he died.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.710 align:middle line:84%
His girlfriend or his
wife or whoever it was--

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: She wanted an
investigation into his death.

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And she sent a bunch
of information to him.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And he said none
of it checked out.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And he went to law enforcement,
other law enforcement,

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:14.480 align:middle line:84%
said here's what
she's telling me.

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Can you send me these
records or show them to me?

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, because he
claimed that he was involved

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:23.750 align:middle line:84%
in the field of explosives,
in the foundational work

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:26.210 align:middle line:84%
of the creation of I
don't know, however many--

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.270 align:middle line:90%
a lot of these bases.

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:29.450 align:middle line:10%
And he said at the
time, which was--

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:31.577 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: He very
well may have been.

00:47:31.577 --> 00:47:34.035 align:middle line:10%
The stuff that was questionable
was about the circumstances

00:47:34.035 --> 00:47:35.020 align:middle line:10%
of his death.

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:35.820 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:38.450 align:middle line:10%
Well, about the tubing being
wrapped around his neck

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:40.850 align:middle line:10%
as a suicide, when he was
trying to get out and tell

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:42.200 align:middle line:10%
this story every day.

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:42.320 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.986 align:middle line:10%
He said that that
stuff didn't check out

00:47:43.986 --> 00:47:46.610 align:middle line:10%
and it was basically,
definitely a suicide.

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:50.700 align:middle line:10%
And it didn't look to him like
somebody else had done it.

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And then the other thing
is, on top of that,

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:56.415 align:middle line:84%
what he's talking
about, there's--

00:47:56.415 --> 00:47:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He was
talking about aliens,

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.277 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] in military,
firefights at Dulce

00:48:00.277 --> 00:48:01.360 align:middle line:90%
underground, and so forth.

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Exactly.

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He's not
the only person.

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: There is no way
to prove that happened

00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:07.270 align:middle line:90%
except for that he said it.

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:10.690 align:middle line:84%
It very well may have, and
maybe he knew about this.

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:16.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's so covered up
with other people's stories

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and rumors and all
that, that I think--

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this
is the case a lot.

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.596 align:middle line:84%
At this point, I
think it's whoever,

00:48:22.596 --> 00:48:25.220 align:middle line:84%
wherever that story came from,
I think it was just planted just

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:27.178 align:middle line:84%
for the same way Bennewitz's
story was planted,

00:48:27.178 --> 00:48:30.490 align:middle line:84%
just to get people interested
in a way that made no sense.

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:32.500 align:middle line:10%
So the only people that
would be interested

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:35.920 align:middle line:10%
were either UFO researchers
or foreign nationals

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:38.170 align:middle line:10%
that we're trying to find
out about underground bases.

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And there certainly are
underground facilities

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:43.720 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, maybe even
near Dulce, New Mexico.

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.454 align:middle line:90%
Before he died, Gabe told me--

00:48:45.454 --> 00:48:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Gabe Valdez said, I'll take
you to where that entrance is.

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:49.810 align:middle line:10%
I said, I would
really like to see it.

00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:52.570 align:middle line:10%
He said it's dynamited and it's
covered with rocks and stuff

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:53.370 align:middle line:10%
now.

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:56.380 align:middle line:10%
But you could really tell that
there was something there,

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:57.640 align:middle line:10%
not operational anymore.

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.400 align:middle line:10%
And he thought it was--
and this is totally insane,

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.590 align:middle line:10%
but it sounds James Bond-ish.

00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:04.630 align:middle line:84%
He said the best thing
he could think of

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:07.300 align:middle line:84%
was that it was an
aircraft testing

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.727 align:middle line:90%
facility inside a mountain.

00:49:09.727 --> 00:49:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the
last place you expect

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:12.726 align:middle line:84%
to see aircraft
coming in and out.

00:49:12.726 --> 00:49:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And Bennewitz said
he saw aircraft

00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:15.070 align:middle line:90%
coming in out of the mountain.

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:16.230 align:middle line:84%
It would disappear
into the mountain.

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like, how did
it fly into the mountain?

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:20.998 align:middle line:10%
He thought there might have
been some kind of opening there

00:49:20.998 --> 00:49:23.190 align:middle line:10%
and things would fly into it.

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:24.732 align:middle line:10%
Because it makes no
sense whatsoever.

00:49:24.732 --> 00:49:26.731 align:middle line:10%
Usually you're going have
a runway or something.

00:49:26.731 --> 00:49:27.580 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:28.440 align:middle line:90%
He flew inside the mountain.

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Not with exotic
technologies, anyway.

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: So I don't have
any way to prove that either,

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:33.660 align:middle line:84%
but it seems more
likely to me than there

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.160 align:middle line:84%
was an underground
base with aliens.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.076 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Well, thanks
for yet another rumor.

00:49:37.076 --> 00:49:38.300 align:middle line:10%
Appreciate it.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:38.660 align:middle line:10%
Also--

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:39.960 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: It's always
what's more likely to me.

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.460 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: It was
more-- it's logic.

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:42.360 align:middle line:10%
I get that.

00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:43.980 align:middle line:10%
But let's talk,
before we wrap it up,

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.660 align:middle line:10%
let's talk a little bit
about the people who

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:47.284 align:middle line:10%
are former spooks
who come out and say,

00:49:47.284 --> 00:49:49.320 align:middle line:10%
hey, I was a former
spook and-- like

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:52.920 align:middle line:10%
Ed Dames, John Alexander,
and what their roles are

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.570 align:middle line:10%
and how you perceive them.

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And the whole notion
that the kill shot.

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: Oh, is it about the
sun erupting somehow and then

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:03.490 align:middle line:90%
wiping out all--

00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We're all dead.

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.090 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:08.800 align:middle line:10%
In the '90s I interviewed
four or five remote viewers.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.880 align:middle line:10%
And I asked about Ed Dames.

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Off the record,
not in my magazine,

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:16.770 align:middle line:84%
they said he subscribed
at that point

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:20.350 align:middle line:84%
to all kinds of
scientific journals.

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:22.360 align:middle line:84%
They talk about stuff
in those journals way

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.190 align:middle line:90%
before it had a normal press.

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:26.684 align:middle line:10%
So the thing is that a lot of
his predictions they thought

00:50:26.684 --> 00:50:28.600 align:middle line:10%
came from him reading
the scientific journals.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:31.360 align:middle line:10%
And of course that stuff's
going to come out eventually,

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:34.870 align:middle line:10%
because a lot of that scientific
research, if it pans out

00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:37.000 align:middle line:10%
becomes popular or
it becomes relevant,

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.376 align:middle line:10%
it gets into the
mainstream news.

00:50:38.376 --> 00:50:40.458 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and it's
interesting about remote

00:50:40.458 --> 00:50:41.290 align:middle line:90%
viewing in general.

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:44.080 align:middle line:84%
This brings in-- because
the CIA uses remote viewing

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:47.230 align:middle line:84%
and military-- and
Russia, United States,

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:49.540 align:middle line:84%
a lot of governments
use remote viewing.

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:52.180 align:middle line:10%
It's fascinating
because, when you're

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:54.620 align:middle line:10%
talking about those
areas of the mind,

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:57.280 align:middle line:10%
there is kind of
abstract remote viewing,

00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.630 align:middle line:10%
and then there's
technical remote viewing.

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:03.340 align:middle line:10%
I've been involved
in remote viewing

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:06.940 align:middle line:10%
even in a classroom
level, where you

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:10.150 align:middle line:10%
have 90 seconds to
ascertain what's

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:12.070 align:middle line:10%
sitting in a box in
the front of the room

00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:13.278 align:middle line:10%
and then they show it to you.

00:51:13.278 --> 00:51:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So you're actually connecting
with the intelligence

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.560 align:middle line:84%
or information of
what's in that box.

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:20.950 align:middle line:10%
But if you're doing
something more abstract,

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:25.960 align:middle line:10%
your mind is also totally
open to infiltration

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:30.310 align:middle line:10%
of thoughts and ideas and
images from other forces, even

00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:32.530 align:middle line:10%
other military forces.

00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:35.540 align:middle line:10%
So how do you even claim
sovereignty and accuracy

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:37.330 align:middle line:10%
anymore in the field
of remote viewing?

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:39.830 align:middle line:10%
And I ask that because, as you
say, Ed Dames could've been--

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.150 align:middle line:10%
they could have
been remote viewing.

00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:42.691 align:middle line:10%
He could have been
seeing things that

00:51:42.691 --> 00:51:46.420 align:middle line:10%
were literally put there for
his amusement or information.

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: I suppose-- I'm
not saying Ed Dames was--

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I like Ed.

00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:51.010 align:middle line:90%
I've interviewed him.

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: I'm not saying
that he was doing this

00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:55.357 align:middle line:84%
because-- and that he
was not a remote viewer.

00:51:55.357 --> 00:51:57.940 align:middle line:84%
I think he did have experiences,
and he knew what he was doing

00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.140 align:middle line:90%
and knew how to teach it.

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:01.127 align:middle line:84%
The thing is his
ego gets in the way.

00:52:01.127 --> 00:52:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's true, but
that's true of almost everyone

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:04.260 align:middle line:90%
we've mentioned.

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: It is, and also it's--

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:11.410 align:middle line:84%
not to disparage
anybody else anymore,

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I talked to a lot of
these remote viewers.

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I believe they are telling
me the truth about what

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:16.780 align:middle line:90%
happened to them.

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:19.630 align:middle line:10%
And the reason I believe it
is because, once again, I

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:24.340 align:middle line:10%
had personal experience
with it, just like you have.

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:25.540 align:middle line:10%
I did an exercise.

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:28.600 align:middle line:10%
It was in Joe McMoneagle's
book, in "Mind Trek," I think.

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.340 align:middle line:10%
And it worked great.

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:33.310 align:middle line:10%
A friend of mine and I guessed
almost exactly what each of us

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:34.540 align:middle line:10%
had hidden in our houses.

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:35.472 align:middle line:90%
There's no way I--

00:52:35.472 --> 00:52:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the thing is
that is our birthright as human

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:38.730 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:40.939 align:middle line:84%
We all have that built-in
capability anyway.

00:52:40.939 --> 00:52:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: To some degree.

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But we can also be
manipulated via that very same

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:46.010 align:middle line:90%
faculty.

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:49.210 align:middle line:84%
I think there may
be ways to block it.

00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:52.480 align:middle line:10%
I think Lyn Buchanan
has talked about that.

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:55.150 align:middle line:10%
There may be ways to
block that influence.

00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:58.210 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what they are.

00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:00.430 align:middle line:10%
If you ever get to talk to
him or talk to him again--

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:00.541 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah, no.

00:53:00.541 --> 00:53:01.120 align:middle line:90%
That sounds good.

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:02.328 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Ask him about that.

00:53:02.328 --> 00:53:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:06.800 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: I've heard that from
him and some other people too.

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.650 align:middle line:10%
And the thing is,
once again, once you

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:13.110 align:middle line:10%
have that personal
experience with something,

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:15.460 align:middle line:10%
people can come to you
and BS all they want.

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:17.410 align:middle line:10%
But it's happened
to you, and it's

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:19.620 align:middle line:10%
happened to me multiple
times in different ways.

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:20.786 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree with you.

00:53:20.786 --> 00:53:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BISHOP: So apart from the
fact that these guys all

00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:25.430 align:middle line:84%
seem sincere, they are very
nice, extremely intelligent,

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and knew about a lot of other
things besides remote viewing,

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:32.210 align:middle line:84%
I am willing to
accept that it works.

00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And also it goes
along with thousands

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:36.980 align:middle line:84%
of years of history of people
being able to see things.

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oracles and so forth.

00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:39.846 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
things he told me

00:53:39.846 --> 00:53:43.129 align:middle line:84%
after we finished our interview,
I found really interesting.

00:53:43.129 --> 00:53:44.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it was on camera.

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:46.850 align:middle line:84%
But he was talking
about some beings

00:53:46.850 --> 00:53:48.500 align:middle line:84%
that he and his team
of remote viewers

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.180 align:middle line:84%
were seeing in
another dimension.

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:52.670 align:middle line:10%
And it was this
elephantine kind of being

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:56.720 align:middle line:10%
who seemed to be benign,
if not even helpful.

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.400 align:middle line:10%
And I immediately
popped to mind--

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:03.530 align:middle line:10%
the image of Ganesha
popped into my mind.

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:05.210 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, isn't
that interesting

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:08.960 align:middle line:10%
where some of these
ancient archetypal stories

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:10.640 align:middle line:10%
and traditions have come from?

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:13.310 align:middle line:84%
From that very field these guys
are looking into, not knowing

00:54:13.310 --> 00:54:14.150 align:middle line:90%
what they're seeing.

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:15.020 align:middle line:90%
But they can see it.

00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:15.620 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: Right.

00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:16.840 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Not understanding it.

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.560 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: They may
be able to hook

00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:19.490 align:middle line:10%
into some archetypal
dimension where

00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:21.410 align:middle line:10%
that becomes what they see.

00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:26.390 align:middle line:10%
I think there's a lot to be
said for what people expect,

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:29.360 align:middle line:10%
what things have been
encoded in human history,

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:31.411 align:middle line:10%
and how that might be
accessible to everybody.

00:54:31.411 --> 00:54:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I agree
with you on that,

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:34.620 align:middle line:84%
including the
whole UFO ET story.

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:37.306 align:middle line:84%
One final question
because we're out of time.

00:54:37.306 --> 00:54:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Who do you think-- who do you
particularly appreciate out

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.180 align:middle line:84%
there right now,
that you think has

00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:44.090 align:middle line:84%
an intelligent, common sense
approach to UFO research?

00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:46.190 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: Just about
everybody in that book

00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:48.170 align:middle line:10%
that I was recently
published in called

00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:49.980 align:middle line:10%
"UFOs, Reframing the Debate."

00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:50.810 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:51.610 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP: Yeah.

00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:56.270 align:middle line:10%
Chris Rutkowski, Miles
Lewis, Jack Brewer--

00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:57.600 align:middle line:10%
god, who else is in there.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.600 align:middle line:84%
But if you check
that book out, I've

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.310 align:middle line:84%
talked to people
that have basically

00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:03.270 align:middle line:90%
given up on UFO study.

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:05.240 align:middle line:10%
And they said, I
saw that book and it

00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.520 align:middle line:10%
made me feel like, oh,
I think we can go ahead

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.430 align:middle line:10%
with this because these
ideas are either new to them

00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:12.712 align:middle line:10%
or they haven't been
brought up in a long time,

00:55:12.712 --> 00:55:13.670 align:middle line:10%
and it gives them hope.

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:16.128 align:middle line:84%
And being involved with that
book really gave me hope, too.

00:55:16.128 --> 00:55:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, I want to do
another interview on that one.

00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:19.511 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:55:19.511 --> 00:55:20.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Greg.

00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:21.593 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate you being here.

00:55:21.593 --> 00:55:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BISHOP: Thank you.

00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Greg's book of essays
is titled, "It Defies Language"

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:28.670 align:middle line:84%
and you can find it in
all the normal places.

00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:30.530 align:middle line:10%
Meanwhile, you might
also enjoy my interview

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:32.660 align:middle line:10%
with Ken Cherry in
the Gaia archives.

00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us on "Open Minds."

00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:42.465 align:middle line:90%
