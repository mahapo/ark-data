00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.180 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: This
conversation may be a bit

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.360 align:middle line:10%
in your face if you're a strict
adherent to biblical texts.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Paul Wallis, an Anglican
pastor and former archdeacon,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.580 align:middle line:84%
is a biblical scholar
and has helped

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.990 align:middle line:84%
translate a story as to who
were the gods in the Bible.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.390 align:middle line:84%
They do not resemble what
I learned in Sunday school.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.600 align:middle line:90%
And why does this matter?

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Because the same influences
are interfering with

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:90%
humankind to this day.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.903 align:middle line:90%
Is that fair to say, Paul?

00:00:39.903 --> 00:00:41.903 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL WALLIS: Yes,
that's fair to say, Regina.

00:00:41.903 --> 00:00:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And welcome.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.520 align:middle line:90%
You've come from Australia.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed you on
my side a couple of times.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.080 align:middle line:84%
But we haven't had a chance
to sit face to face before.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.570 align:middle line:90%
So this is fabulous.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:90%
It's a real treat.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: It's great to be
in the same room with you.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.350 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So here we are,
the word hermeneutics--

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.610 align:middle line:90%
hermeneutics.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.270 align:middle line:84%
You're a religious educator that
specializes in hermeneutics.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.290 align:middle line:90%
What is hermeneutics?

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Because I just
think of hermetics.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.320 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what it is.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: Hermeneutics
is a great word.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.010 align:middle line:10%
It's the principles
of interpretation.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.390 align:middle line:10%
And so one of my roles in my 33
years in church-based ministry

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.190 align:middle line:10%
was training pastors.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And I trained them in the
history of Christian thought

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.880 align:middle line:90%
and hermeneutics.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.610 align:middle line:10%
So we would find the tools to
work out what's in the text.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.470 align:middle line:84%
How can we get out
of the text what

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.050 align:middle line:84%
the writer intended instead
of us reading things in?

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And so we would look
at source analysis.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Where does this text come from?

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Is it the original form?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.333 align:middle line:90%
If it isn't, how does it differ?

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.133 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.060 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Form analysis, what kind
of literature is it?

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And then the
linguistic question,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.650 align:middle line:90%
what do the words mean?

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.430 align:middle line:84%
So these were the tools
that I explored with pastors

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.320 align:middle line:90%
over 15-year period.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was those
skills that got me

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.910 align:middle line:84%
into the whole world
of paleocontact,

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.170 align:middle line:90%
which we're going to get into.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, we are going to.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.900 align:middle line:90%
So first of all, let's begin--

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.420 align:middle line:84%
we'll just start with all of
the names for God in the Bible.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's just start with
the names and how

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.590 align:middle line:84%
they run parallel
to other texts,

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.500 align:middle line:84%
such as Sumerian texts
and the Sky People,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.360 align:middle line:84%
because this
launches us right in.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: Well, when we talk
about the Bible, people think,

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.210 align:middle line:84%
oh, yes, that's
the book about God.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.390 align:middle line:84%
But if I were to
tell you that there

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.120 align:middle line:84%
is no word in the Bible for a
transcendent creator spiritual

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:90%
God, you might be surprised.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.550 align:middle line:84%
But there's no word
there that means that.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.640 align:middle line:84%
There are other words
that get translated as God

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.830 align:middle line:90%
or the Lord or the Almighty.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Or gods.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: Or gods.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.240 align:middle line:84%
But in my work, I've
gone to those words

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and asked, what do
they mean at root?

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Because if you start reading
lexicons, they'll tell you,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.600 align:middle line:84%
oh, this translation
is uncertain,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.540 align:middle line:84%
or this translation is
probably inaccurate.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:90%
So we go to the roots.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And the oldest word in the
Bible used for God is "Elohim."

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And the roots mean
the powerful ones.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you'll realize

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that's why there are plural
behaviors, plural verb forms.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.700 align:middle line:90%
That's why God says let us make.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Let us make the humans
to look like one of us.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.660 align:middle line:90%
One of whom?

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.650 align:middle line:90%
One of the powerful ones.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.110 align:middle line:90%
So that's Elohim.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.630 align:middle line:90%
Then there are the Bene Elohim.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Literally, that means the
sons of the powerful ones.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.170 align:middle line:84%
But the way it's
used suggests it's

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.630 align:middle line:84%
like the sons and daughters
of the American Revolution.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.990 align:middle line:84%
It means the ones like,
having the characteristics of.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.970 align:middle line:84%
So we've got the ones
like the powerful ones.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.320 align:middle line:90%
That's the second wave.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got El
Elyon, the highest.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:84%
It means the powerful
one more senior

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.140 align:middle line:90%
than the other powerful ones.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.850 align:middle line:90%
That's El Elyon.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.430 align:middle line:84%
You notice God hasn't
cropped up yet.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.970 align:middle line:84%
El Shaddai gets translated
as the Almighty,

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean that.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.380 align:middle line:84%
If you go to really
authoritative lexicons

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.720 align:middle line:84%
like Brown-Driver-Briggs,
you will

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.870 align:middle line:84%
find that it will
tell you that Almighty

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.700 align:middle line:90%
is an invented translation.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.340 align:middle line:84%
It could mean the powerful
one of the mountains.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.589 align:middle line:84%
It could mean the powerful
one of the plains.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:84%
I argue in my book
"The Eden Conspiracy,"

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:84%
it actually means the
powerful one, the destroyer.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So when he shows up,
introduces himself to Abraham,

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.120 align:middle line:84%
his opening line is I'm the
powerful one, the destroyer.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Walk in front of me and
don't put a foot wrong.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's his
introduction to Abraham.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, that's
where we still are today.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: Yes.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.247 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Isn't
that interesting?

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:41.590 align:middle line:90%
So when the destroyer comes--

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and please share with us some
of the names of the one who

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.450 align:middle line:90%
is known as the destroyer.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: Well, El Shaddai,
the significance of that is,

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.230 align:middle line:84%
I think, in that moment
where he meets Abraham,

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:84%
it sets up this expectation
because we think that's God.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.140 align:middle line:84%
We now think we live
in a universe where

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.620 align:middle line:84%
we have to tip toe
around for fear

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:84%
of offending the Almighty,
the invented translation

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.780 align:middle line:90%
because he's going to punish us.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.660 align:middle line:84%
He's going to throw us into
hell and torment us forever

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.720 align:middle line:90%
if we get it wrong.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I think it goes back to that
moment where we read that

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:90%
as a God text, and it isn't.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think, as you're hinting,
the name of the destroyer

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.420 align:middle line:90%
occurs all around the world.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.810 align:middle line:84%
You go to India,
talk about Shiva.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:84%
There are other names around the
world that mean the same thing.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's a recollection
of the same memory

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.810 align:middle line:84%
in our cultural memory of times
when we were invaded, colonized

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.810 align:middle line:84%
and overpowered by beings
that were not human.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And that didn't have
any empathy with us.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And that is a current through
the biblical narrative.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not the only kind
of contact we have,

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:84%
because there are
other beings who

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.610 align:middle line:90%
show up who are a lot nicer.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We'll talk
about that as well.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.060 align:middle line:84%
The reason I love your work and
want to talk to you about this

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.790 align:middle line:84%
is because, literally,
the world is still

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.030 align:middle line:84%
divided into these
mindsets that we're

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.570 align:middle line:84%
all given birth under
these same destroyer gods,

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.250 align:middle line:84%
but pitting us
against each other

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.080 align:middle line:84%
as though one person's
God is better than another

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.650 align:middle line:84%
when we really all been raised
under the same influence

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.620 align:middle line:84%
that we have to answer to that
is a master over our lives.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think most people
watching this by now

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.050 align:middle line:90%
know that is not true.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: No, that's not true.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very dramatic
moment in the Bible,

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.550 align:middle line:84%
it comes in Deuteronomy
32 that tells you straight

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.540 align:middle line:84%
away that the Elohim
have invaded our planet.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're now
carving up territory.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And El Elyon, the chief, is
giving this parcel of land

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.370 align:middle line:84%
to this powerful one,
this parcel of land

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:90%
to this powerful one.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And then the Yahweh
character gets a people group

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.250 align:middle line:90%
with no land.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So he's in a foul
mood from that point

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.470 align:middle line:84%
on because he's going to have
to wrestle some land off someone

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And so the human
beings get caught

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.080 align:middle line:84%
in the conflicts
of these Elohim,

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:84%
who are all jostling
up against each other

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.100 align:middle line:84%
because they're
wanting resources.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.140 align:middle line:90%
They're wanting hegemony.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.960 align:middle line:90%
And we are their foot soldiers.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And so we've grown
up with this mindset

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:84%
that we are here to serve
the higher ups and all

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.360 align:middle line:84%
the arguments and
conflicts they have.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.970 align:middle line:84%
It gets even worse,
though, when we

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.910 align:middle line:84%
translate that community
of warring individuals

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and morph it into
a single entity.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, the only
God, the God Almighty.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.702 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: Yeah, and so then
how do you explain the violence?

00:07:34.702 --> 00:07:36.535 align:middle line:84%
Then how do you explain
the lack of empathy?

00:07:36.535 --> 00:07:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The brutality.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: The brutality, yes.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so
this is something--

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.290 align:middle line:84%
I'll just ask you at this
point before we go any further.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:49.590 align:middle line:84%
So as a person of substance in
the church, how in the world

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:84%
did you ever explain
that to a congregation?

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And I asked because by five,
I knew something was wrong.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I thought, no, if
there's a God, they

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.470 align:middle line:84%
don't kill people, ask people
to give up their firstborn.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.450 align:middle line:90%
They would never be mean.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: Exactly.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.390 align:middle line:90%
And children do pick that up.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Children will ask
these questions.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Why has God changed his mind
and decided to genocide everyone

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.230 align:middle line:90%
with a flood?

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Why is God punishing
70,000 innocent people?

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.300 align:middle line:90%
That's not right, is it?

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Children pick this up.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.480 align:middle line:90%
They know there's something off.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.390 align:middle line:90%
And, well, preachers do as well.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.320 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.362 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How do they
keep the story going then?

00:08:27.362 --> 00:08:30.768 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how did you feel
personally when you--

00:08:30.768 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: When I came
against these texts?

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.659 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:38.039 align:middle line:84%
I, like a child, instinctively
knew these could not

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.710 align:middle line:90%
be accurate stories about God.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
church father way back

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.460 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning
of Christianity who

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.460 align:middle line:84%
was considered to be the
father of hermeneutics.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And he came up with
a little schematic

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.320 align:middle line:84%
to help preachers
with this problem.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying, if you
take the Elohim and Yahweh

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.830 align:middle line:84%
stories at face value
as God's stories,

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.500 align:middle line:84%
you'll have to believe
of God such things

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.440 align:middle line:84%
as we would not believe of the
most savage and unjust of men.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do with it?

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.730 align:middle line:84%
You look for another
layer of meaning.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.530 align:middle line:84%
You go for the
moral of the story.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.492 align:middle line:84%
And if the moral of
the story is appalling,

00:09:13.492 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:90%
you look for another meaning.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.350 align:middle line:90%
Is there a prophetic meaning?

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Is it a metaphor
of something else?

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So he's given this
helpful preacher's guide,

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.750 align:middle line:84%
which is great if all you want
to do is produce a sermon.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And, therefore,
brothers and sisters

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.890 align:middle line:84%
if that's what you're
looking for, fine.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.190 align:middle line:84%
But if you're wanting
to understand the text,

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
to go back to it

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.310 align:middle line:90%
and ask some deeper questions.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is that
most pastors are just as

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.860 align:middle line:90%
overscheduled as everyone else.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:90%
They'll come across the text.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.928 align:middle line:84%
They'll find a way to
preach around it and think,

00:09:44.928 --> 00:09:46.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
to get back to that

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and work out what's
really going on there.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they never
do get back to it.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was really only
because I was invalided out

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.530 align:middle line:84%
for a while with an
ultimate Frisbee injury

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.160 align:middle line:84%
that I had the opportunity to
go back to some of these texts

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.440 align:middle line:84%
and think, well, what
really is happening there?

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.310 align:middle line:84%
If it's not a God story,
what is it a story about?

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:09.230 align:middle line:84%
What was it our ancestors
wanted to know here?

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so by allowing
that story to stand--

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.300 align:middle line:84%
others, not yourself-- by
allowing that story to stand,

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:21.340 align:middle line:84%
it is essentially
justified colonization

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:26.258 align:middle line:84%
of every kind from virtually
the beginning of modern history.

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: That is the problem.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.080 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly the problem.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.160 align:middle line:84%
If we read these stories of
colonization and violence--

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and all colonization
is violent--

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.060 align:middle line:84%
but interpret it as a God story,
it distorts our image of God.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So instead of God being a
beautiful idea, the source

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.400 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos and everything
in it, that in which

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.350 align:middle line:84%
we all live and move and have
our being, all of a sudden,

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle line:84%
we've got this violent
entity who can be brutal,

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.300 align:middle line:84%
can't be reasoned with,
is actually unforgiving,

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and does things
that really can't

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.550 align:middle line:84%
be justified morally,
except if he's God,

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.120 align:middle line:90%
you have to justify it.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:07.180 align:middle line:84%
So if God is xenophobic, you
have to justify xenophobia.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.240 align:middle line:84%
If God thinks in terms
of the human race divided

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.820 align:middle line:84%
into my people
and not my people,

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.340 align:middle line:84%
you have to start
thinking in the same way.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And, Regina, you're
absolutely right.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.450 align:middle line:84%
You can draw a
straight line from that

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.940 align:middle line:84%
to all the conquests
we've made, invading

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:84%
each other's countries,
enslaving other people groups,

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of misogyny
and injustice

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:32.510 align:middle line:84%
done in the name of God
because that's how God behaves,

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.450 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.250 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What a perfect point
to bring up because most people

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.430 align:middle line:84%
think, how could this be
done in the name of God?

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.990 align:middle line:90%
But you just explained it.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.150 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking
at the God the way

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.810 align:middle line:84%
I was taught about God in Sunday
school, I found it terrifying.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:51.470 align:middle line:84%
I hated those stories
and murder and blood

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.870 align:middle line:84%
running down the
streets and locusts

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:90%
and giving up your first born.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:56.750 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: Well, that's right.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And the moment
you allow yourself

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.300 align:middle line:84%
to consider the possibility
it's not a God story,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.350 align:middle line:84%
the moral evaluations
are obvious.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.660 align:middle line:90%
A genocide is a genocide.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.887 align:middle line:84%
A brutalization is
a brutalization.

00:12:10.887 --> 00:12:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my
daughter coming home

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.060 align:middle line:90%
from school one day.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And they were going to a
Christian school in Canberra,

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.770 align:middle line:90%
Australia, at the time.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And they'd done a
Bible study in class.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think Evie was
10 when this happened.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And they'd studied a text
where God had just slaughtered

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.170 align:middle line:90%
another bunch of people.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And the students were asking,
isn't a God a God of love?

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.450 align:middle line:90%
Why would he do that?

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.670 align:middle line:90%
And the teacher gave his answer.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter Evie
said, I wasn't really

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.500 align:middle line:90%
convinced by what he said.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, did
you ask a question, Evie?

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yes, I put
up my hand, and I said,

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.870 align:middle line:90%
would God do that?

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:54.200 align:middle line:84%
How could you justify
that in the name of love?

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what
did the teacher say?

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
he gave an answer.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.670 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not sure he really
believed what he was saying.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.400 align:middle line:90%
So we all have that instinct.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.630 align:middle line:90%
Children have it.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.290 align:middle line:84%
But the translations have
kind of bullied believers

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:14.160 align:middle line:84%
into not asking the questions,
because you can't question God.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we're
talking about, certainly,

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.970 align:middle line:84%
most of the developed world for
sure in terms of the religions

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and some of the other
cultures that have come up

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.400 align:middle line:90%
socioeconomically behind.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Nonetheless, all the
Judeo-Christian religions,

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:33.990 align:middle line:84%
the Muslim faith, all under
these brutal gods, although I

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:84%
don't really know enough about
the Muslim texts and the Quran

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.180 align:middle line:84%
to know how that piece
fits into that story.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.000 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about--
because what this has done

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.750 align:middle line:84%
has given the entirety
of all of those cultures

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.210 align:middle line:84%
an innate sense
of low self-esteem

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:90%
just to be born human.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: Yes, you are made
to feel guilty for having been

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.480 align:middle line:90%
born.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:84%
So this whole doctrine
of original sin,

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.120 align:middle line:84%
which is a total distortion
of what's in the Bible,

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.050 align:middle line:84%
means that you don't have to do
anything wrong in order for you

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:10.540 align:middle line:84%
to have to feel ashamed of
yourself, and not only that,

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.290 align:middle line:84%
but to believe that your whole
purpose is to serve the higher

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.330 align:middle line:90%
ups, serve God ultimately.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.320 align:middle line:84%
But it becomes something
that's very easy to manipulate.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So we have churches where
people can be manipulated.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And we have whole
societies where

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.730 align:middle line:84%
we're wired to serve somebody
better than ourselves.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:33.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my gran, she grew up--
she was a Downton Abbey era

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:34.750 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And she began her life
in service working

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.220 align:middle line:90%
in one of those great houses.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And I remember seeing a
documentary about that period.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.880 align:middle line:84%
They were interviewing
servants about the families

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.680 align:middle line:90%
they had served.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.090 align:middle line:90%
And there was this big house.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Five people lived in the house,
and 50 servants served them.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And that was seen as
normal, acceptable.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.350 align:middle line:84%
They interviewed some of
these servants years later.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.110 align:middle line:90%
They were in their 70s and 80s.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And the interviewer
said, you talk

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:07.780 align:middle line:84%
as if the five in the
family were better than you.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well, they were, they said.

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.870 align:middle line:84%
I thought, better
in what respect?

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.340 align:middle line:90%
Better morally.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.780 align:middle line:90%
Were they more intelligent?

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.630 align:middle line:84%
It was just this wiring
that we are all here

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:22.820 align:middle line:84%
to serve someone more
powerful, wealthier,

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.370 align:middle line:90%
more important than ourselves.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to
this worldview of a God

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.280 align:middle line:84%
who demands obedience
and service and us

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.420 align:middle line:90%
all tiptoeing around.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.010 align:middle line:90%
But it's a distortion.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And I love going to the root
meanings of the key words

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.090 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that
the stories are really

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.080 align:middle line:90%
about something else.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.450 align:middle line:84%
They're really about how
unacceptable that is.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:47.230 align:middle line:84%
They're really about finding
our power as individuals

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.860 align:middle line:84%
and discovering each other and
discovering our people power.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are inspiring
moments of people power

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.440 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible, all
of which disappear

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.812 align:middle line:84%
the moment you start translating
Yahweh and El Shaddai as God.

00:16:00.812 --> 00:16:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about
the people power that was

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.060 align:middle line:84%
originally there that
has gone missing.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: There's a powerful
moment in 1 Samuel 8.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's a moment in
which the tribes of Israel

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.870 align:middle line:84%
have just got fed up of that
scenario I was just describing.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.900 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
serve Yahweh anymore.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:26.780 align:middle line:84%
He's had enough, virgin girls,
gold, beef, and lamb off them.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
want to be governed

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.460 align:middle line:84%
by someone who doesn't have
any fellow feeling with them

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.880 align:middle line:90%
any longer.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And so the leaders of
the tribes come together,

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and they confront
Yahweh's deputy.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And they say, it's enough.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.960 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
serve Yahweh anymore.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.190 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have a human
leader for human society.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, Yahweh
knows he's lost his power.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Up until that point, he's
governed through terror,

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.810 align:middle line:90%
through violence.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And now he has a bunch of
people who have clearly

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:05.550 align:middle line:84%
made a decision which amounted
to, what can he do, kill us?

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And they've reached the
point where that attitude

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.619 align:middle line:90%
has transmuted into courage.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:11.970 align:middle line:90%
They're acting together.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:13.619 align:middle line:90%
They're speaking with one voice.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:84%
And when Yahweh sees that,
he realizes he has to go.

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:19.020 align:middle line:90%
And so he goes.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.750 align:middle line:84%
He's replaced with
human kings and queens,

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.579 align:middle line:90%
but the story goes on.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And the lesson in the story is
the persistence of old powers

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:31.720 align:middle line:84%
because Yahweh might not
be their king anymore.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But he's still defining
their foreign policy.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.020 align:middle line:84%
He's still telling
the kings and queens

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.550 align:middle line:90%
what they can and can't do.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.490 align:middle line:84%
If public policy departs
too far from what he wants,

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:44.220 align:middle line:84%
he hoicks it back
to what he wants.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And this resonates with me
having grown up in Britain,

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.160 align:middle line:84%
because in Britain,
for 800 years,

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.980 align:middle line:84%
we've been trying to
get rid of crown power.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.530 align:middle line:84%
We've been trying to
become a democracy.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And after 800 years
of major changes,

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.030 align:middle line:84%
revolutions, Magna Carta,
getting rid of the monarchy,

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:84%
redefining the monarchy, we've
had all the social movements,

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:10.390 align:middle line:84%
the labor movements, two
world wars, a Reformation,

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:84%
even now, our democratically
elected prime minister

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.900 align:middle line:84%
can't go more than
a week before having

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:84%
to report to the crown what
he or she has been up to.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Nothing can become law
unless the senior member

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.570 align:middle line:90%
of the Windsor family says, OK.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:29.320 align:middle line:84%
We now know that her late
Majesty Queen Elizabeth

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.190 align:middle line:84%
II blocked about 160
pieces of legislation

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.350 align:middle line:84%
until she'd got
exemptions from them.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And they were laws to do
with workers' rights, animal

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:90%
welfare.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.340 align:middle line:84%
There was a law introduced
in the '60s saying

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.620 align:middle line:84%
it's illegal to
discriminate against people

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.440 align:middle line:84%
in the workplace on the
basis of their ethnicity.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Or the queen wouldn't
have any of that,

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.100 align:middle line:84%
had to get an exemption
before that could become law.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.640 align:middle line:84%
So don't tell me that's
ceremonial power.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.992 align:middle line:84%
That's crown power
that is persisting.

00:18:56.992 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But I've
seen Instagram,

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:00.242 align:middle line:84%
William and Kate are
going to change it all

00:19:00.242 --> 00:19:03.455 align:middle line:84%
because they're hip
when it's their turn.

00:19:03.455 --> 00:19:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: We'll see.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:05.497 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I don't think so.

00:19:05.497 --> 00:19:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: But the Yahweh
story is almost like a template

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.000 align:middle line:84%
for that, where they
get rid of Yahweh.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.350 align:middle line:84%
But he becomes the hidden
hand in geopolitics.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, there is
that exciting moment

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.820 align:middle line:84%
when the people come
together, and they

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:23.020 align:middle line:84%
make a huge change in human
history, human leaders

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.580 align:middle line:90%
for human society.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's another lesson
that disappears when you

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.920 align:middle line:90%
translate it as a God story.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.850 align:middle line:84%
If Yahweh is God, then
they've all been very naughty.

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And they should only
expect all the trouble

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:38.470 align:middle line:84%
that's going to come
their way afterwards.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.750 align:middle line:84%
If Yahweh is something
else, then it's

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.160 align:middle line:90%
a story of people power.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And I argue in "The
Eden Conspiracy"

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.538 align:middle line:84%
that whole story
is a dragon story.

00:19:46.538 --> 00:19:48.205 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, we're
getting into that.

00:19:48.205 --> 00:19:49.930 align:middle line:84%
That kind of shocked
me, actually,

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.940 align:middle line:84%
because I hadn't heard
that spin before.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't even heard that,
never about that translation.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.680 align:middle line:84%
So let's just go
to one point here.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.140 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
the destroyer, Yahweh

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.150 align:middle line:90%
as the destroyer, actually.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:04.030 align:middle line:84%
One of his messages, I
will murder you horribly

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:05.380 align:middle line:90%
because you've displeased me.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Nobody will be able to
protect you from me.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.710 align:middle line:90%
I will get you.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.440 align:middle line:84%
I will smite you, and
then I save you, but only

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.090 align:middle line:90%
if you worship me.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: Yeah, would you
worship someone who says

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:18.530 align:middle line:90%
something like that?

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:19.330 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:21.520 align:middle line:84%
But anyone who's been
in a relationship

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.602 align:middle line:84%
with an abusive partner
recognizes that psychology.

00:20:24.602 --> 00:20:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, exactly.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: Nobody loves you.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.690 align:middle line:90%
Only I love you.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:30.802 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: But only
if you please me.

00:20:30.802 --> 00:20:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't, no one
can protect you from me.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:35.750 align:middle line:84%
It is a psychotic
way of thinking.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So it tells you something
about the individual Yahweh.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:42.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the
language of colonization.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:44.980 align:middle line:90%
That is what any colonizer says.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.770 align:middle line:84%
So when the British
start talking

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:52.030 align:middle line:84%
to the leaders of what was
to become Ghana in the 1800s,

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.830 align:middle line:84%
they were basically
saying, look,

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.440 align:middle line:84%
there are some major
world powers here.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Do you want us on your
side or against you?

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.510 align:middle line:90%
We've got a great fleet here.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Have you noticed our armies?

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.400 align:middle line:90%
So do you want us helping you?

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, please.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, once
the yes, please, comes,

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.330 align:middle line:84%
you find out the colonizers
are there for their benefit,

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.710 align:middle line:90%
not for yours.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And so, really, it's
that same logic.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.573 align:middle line:84%
We'll protect you, but no
one can protect you from us.

00:21:20.573 --> 00:21:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's not so
different in our institutions

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.000 align:middle line:84%
and within our
political systems.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.012 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: Yes.

00:21:26.012 --> 00:21:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're still
reflecting that today.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we're looking out
for you, or your agencies

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:90%
are looking out for you.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Everything above you that you
should simply not question.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And, honestly, most
of humanity does not

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.330 align:middle line:90%
question these systems.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: That's very true.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:45.970 align:middle line:10%
And what's interesting is that
you've got the memory of people

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:49.090 align:middle line:10%
stretching back hundreds and
thousands of years who've

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.180 align:middle line:10%
had these experiences,
who've had to work out,

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.480 align:middle line:10%
how do we live in a world
that operates this way?

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.450 align:middle line:84%
How do we thrive
in a world where

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.370 align:middle line:90%
these abusive powers exist?

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And how do we come together
to avoid being manipulated

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.280 align:middle line:90%
and being told what's what?

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
stories I want to recover

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.270 align:middle line:90%
from the biblical narrative.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And these beings
that you're talking about,

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.330 align:middle line:84%
even this sect of beings are
thought to or known to live

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:21.080 align:middle line:84%
many thousands of years and can
extend their power throughout

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.580 align:middle line:90%
our history.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.930 align:middle line:90%
And it appears they have.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:29.870 align:middle line:84%
So let's go now to some of
the interpretations you found

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.940 align:middle line:84%
getting into the
dragon story because I

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.770 align:middle line:90%
found that's fascinating.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: Well, just to follow
on from what you were saying,

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:40.835 align:middle line:84%
that answer that that
young man was given,

00:22:40.835 --> 00:22:43.430 align:middle line:84%
that really is what the
Bible is telling us.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.740 align:middle line:84%
There is this group
called the El Ba' Adat,

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.110 align:middle line:90%
the council of powers.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors wanted us to
know that you can't understand

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.270 align:middle line:84%
why this world works
the way it does

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:55.400 align:middle line:84%
until you realize
there's a nonhuman

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.740 align:middle line:90%
layer to our governance.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was amazed to find that
in the work of Robert Kirk

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.130 align:middle line:90%
in the 1600s, who was--

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a very
conservative period

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.980 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at, especially for
a Presbyterian minister, which

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.140 align:middle line:90%
he was in Aberfoyle, Scotland.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And just through listening
to the grassroots memory

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.310 align:middle line:84%
of the people there, he came
to exactly this conclusion.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:21.470 align:middle line:84%
He wrote the book "The
Secret Commonwealth"

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.840 align:middle line:84%
saying that we have
visible government.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Then we have covert
government, then the elites

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.090 align:middle line:84%
that run the covert
government, and then

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:32.840 align:middle line:84%
the nonhuman layer that
tells the elites what's what.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And so it's an
ancient story that

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.300 align:middle line:84%
says there's this nonhuman
layer defining what

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.440 align:middle line:90%
happens on planet Earth.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.595 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to
pick up on that first.

00:23:41.595 --> 00:23:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so now let's
go back to what we're talking

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:48.440 align:middle line:84%
about a moment ago, the notion
of a dragon being associated

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.710 align:middle line:90%
with the gods or being the gods.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: Well, there are
lots of dragons in the Bible,

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:56.720 align:middle line:90%
which is--

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They didn't teach
me that in Sunday school.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: No, probably,
it got mentioned.

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:03.440 align:middle line:90%
But then we take it as metaphor.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.330 align:middle line:84%
So we've got
physical descriptions

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.510 align:middle line:84%
of Yahweh that talk about
the thickness of his hide,

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:13.260 align:middle line:84%
the length of his tail,
the length of his snout,

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:17.400 align:middle line:84%
the fire that comes from his
snout, his flight feathers.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And people read this
and think, well,

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.260 align:middle line:84%
that must just be a
metaphor of his power.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.760 align:middle line:84%
But then there are
other texts where

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Yahweh is comparing
himself with other beasts,

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.920 align:middle line:84%
with other animals
and saying that he's

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.170 align:middle line:84%
stronger than these
other animals, which

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:33.690 align:middle line:84%
is a very strange
thing to say if you are

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.640 align:middle line:90%
God, the source of the cosmos.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.210 align:middle line:90%
So it's something else.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And then the shape
of the story tells us

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:43.110 align:middle line:84%
it's a dragon story because
almost all dragon stories

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:45.630 align:middle line:84%
around the world have
this shape, that we begin

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:49.950 align:middle line:84%
with human beings being governed
over by nonhuman entities who

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:51.270 align:middle line:90%
have no fellow feeling.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:52.170 align:middle line:90%
They're cold blooded.

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:53.310 align:middle line:90%
They're draconian.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And then they use terror so
much that it loses its power.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.810 align:middle line:90%
And we saw this in Romania.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:02.820 align:middle line:84%
We saw this in the
Philippines, where

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.782 align:middle line:84%
the people reached
that point of saying,

00:25:04.782 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to
do this anymore.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.090 align:middle line:90%
What are they going to do?

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:08.220 align:middle line:90%
They can only kill us.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And when the people
come together and say,

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:15.000 align:middle line:84%
no more beef, lamb, virgin
girls, gold for you, the dragon

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.430 align:middle line:84%
usually slinks away
off into the mountains.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And we move into a
new period of history,

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:24.510 align:middle line:84%
where we do have human
governance for human society.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:28.620 align:middle line:84%
The Yahweh story follows
that exact same shape

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.620 align:middle line:84%
that I mentioned
earlier in 1 Samuel 8.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And more than that,
his name tells us

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:37.410 align:middle line:84%
that the story fits in the
world's canon of dragon

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.480 align:middle line:84%
narratives because
so many of them

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.220 align:middle line:90%
have this same phonetic pattern.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So if you listen to the names of
the Coca in Portugal and Spain,

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:53.430 align:middle line:84%
the Colchis in Georgia,
Akhekh in Egypt, Kukulkan,

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Q'uq'umatz, Quetzalcoatl,
[NON-ENGLISH],,

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:02.280 align:middle line:84%
They've all got this
"kh, kh" in them.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And you might say that's
very interesting, Paul.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:07.110 align:middle line:84%
But what does that
have to do with Yahweh?

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, Yahweh doesn't sound like
it's got the "kh, kh" in it

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:13.920 align:middle line:90%
until you look at those two hs.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that
they're almost silent now.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.490 align:middle line:84%
But because of the
pattern of sound softening

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:84%
that happens in the
development of language,

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.620 align:middle line:84%
you go back to
proto-northwest Semitic,

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:84%
the ancestor of Hebrew, and
you pronounce hh, "kh kh."

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.580 align:middle line:90%
It's the same sound.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And Hebrew scholars
have been mystified

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.750 align:middle line:84%
by that name for a
long time because it's

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.670 align:middle line:84%
got no etymology in
the Hebrew language.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:39.900 align:middle line:90%
It's got no meaning.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.090 align:middle line:90%
It appears from nowhere.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So we could see
it as a loan word.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.220 align:middle line:84%
But I argue in "The Eden
Conspiracy" it's actually

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.930 align:middle line:90%
a sequence of sounds.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And it puts me in
mind of Doctor Who,

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.760 align:middle line:84%
just to jump into
fiction for a moment

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.340 align:middle line:84%
because I used to love
Doctor Who as a child.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And you knew that
monster was lurking

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:02.040 align:middle line:84%
in that dark corridor because
you could hear it breathing

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.290 align:middle line:90%
"kh, kh" as it came.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if all
around the world,

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:10.020 align:middle line:84%
we've got that sound associated
with these draconian entities

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.180 align:middle line:84%
because we remember
how they sounded,

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.610 align:middle line:84%
the noise they made
as they approached.

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And, again, the Yahweh
stories fit precisely

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:19.870 align:middle line:90%
into that template.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:21.840 align:middle line:84%
But the purpose of
the stories is not

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.610 align:middle line:90%
to make us scared of dragons.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:26.940 align:middle line:84%
It's to make us remember the
power of the people when they

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.970 align:middle line:84%
come together and say, we're
going to work with each other

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.560 align:middle line:90%
and create a new society.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you have this
information, more or less,

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:39.810 align:middle line:84%
if you know how to read it
hiding in plain sight that we

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:41.880 align:middle line:84%
are being controlled
from beyond,

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.500 align:middle line:90%
that we've been colonized.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.472 align:middle line:84%
Entities have come here
and colonized this planet.

00:27:46.472 --> 00:27:48.930 align:middle line:84%
They've been here for thousands
and thousands and thousands

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:50.970 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.970 align:middle line:84%
In your own understanding-- and
I'm asking you to take a leap--

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:56.670 align:middle line:84%
what are they getting
out of this relationship?

00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And are they aware that we are
starting to change as a species

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:02.910 align:middle line:90%
and beginning to wake up?

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: Well, my reading is
there's always been a diversity

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:12.730 align:middle line:84%
of ET races intersecting
with human history.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So we've got lots of
stories of colonization.

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:18.630 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it's very obvious.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.610 align:middle line:84%
You know you've been
colonized because they've

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:23.040 align:middle line:84%
turned up with weaponry
and just taken over.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, going back to Robert
Kirk, it can be more subtle.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And you will just notice shifts
in the culture telling you

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.800 align:middle line:84%
someone else has
just taken over.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.100 align:middle line:84%
But we have memory of other
beings coming and nurturing

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.030 align:middle line:90%
us and helping us.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So lots of the Pleiadian stories
have this kind of character

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:40.710 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.380 align:middle line:84%
If you're listening to
Native American story,

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.480 align:middle line:84%
an Aboriginal Australian
story, there's

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.030 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiadian
connection, people coming

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:52.290 align:middle line:84%
to help humanity progress,
to learn how to farm,

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:54.630 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to
become a civilization.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:84%
The Yolngu people in the
Northern Territory in Australia

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:02.190 align:middle line:84%
have this beautiful story of
the Mimi, who in their dance

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:06.040 align:middle line:84%
told the people how to
hunt and how to fish

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.140 align:middle line:84%
and which plants were good for
food, which were good to avoid,

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.580 align:middle line:90%
which were good for medicine.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:14.090 align:middle line:84%
So there are all these
positive interventions as well.

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And there comes a very
interesting moment

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.330 align:middle line:84%
in the story of the
Bible where the kings

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.490 align:middle line:84%
are deciding whether
they're going

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:24.490 align:middle line:84%
to allow that positive
memory to remain,

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:26.530 align:middle line:84%
or if they want
to get rid of that

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:29.200 align:middle line:84%
and just keep the Yahweh
character because it gives them

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.500 align:middle line:84%
a neat pyramid of powers with
a violent God at the top,

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.610 align:middle line:90%
the king just under.

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:34.540 align:middle line:90%
And then the people--

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Everyone
subservient to the king.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: Subservient
to the king.

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:37.650 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So primitive Judaism had this
diverse memory of contact.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And then it got pared
down to something

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:49.870 align:middle line:84%
the kings thought
was more manageable.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That was Josiah.

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Was that under Josiah?

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: Yes, it
was under Josiah.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:58.300 align:middle line:84%
It started under his
grandfather, King Hezekiah.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:02.860 align:middle line:84%
So this period is the eighth
to the sixth century BCE.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Hezekiah is a king
who is a Yahwist.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.590 align:middle line:84%
He lives in Jerusalem,
and the Jerusalem temple

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.480 align:middle line:90%
is a Yahwist temple.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks to himself,
why should my people not

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.480 align:middle line:90%
worship my God?

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.010 align:middle line:90%
I worship Yahweh.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Everyone should worship Yahweh.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And his Yahwist high
priest Hilkiah says,

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.720 align:middle line:90%
that's a very good idea, sire.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And so they begin this process
of ritual reform, where

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.680 align:middle line:84%
they start shutting down all the
other temples and priesthoods.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So the one devoted
to Asherah, that's

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.930 align:middle line:84%
a positive memory of nurture
in the past, get rid of that.

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:42.290 align:middle line:84%
The ones devoted to
Chemosh, get rid of that.

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Anything else, Dagon,
Baal, get rid of it all.

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.420 align:middle line:84%
We'll knock down the temples,
demolish the standing stones

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.580 align:middle line:84%
that mark the places
where our ancestors met

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:55.030 align:middle line:84%
these advanced beings, break the
heads off the dolls of Asherah

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:57.010 align:middle line:84%
so no one can remember
what she looks like,

00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:01.330 align:middle line:84%
deface the carvings of the
whole tsva ha-shamayim,

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.000 align:middle line:84%
the sky armies that are
in the Jerusalem temple,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.890 align:middle line:84%
because we don't want
people remembering.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:09.350 align:middle line:84%
We want them to think
there's only one God,

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and his name is Yahweh,
one king, one high priest,

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.450 align:middle line:90%
one temple in Jerusalem.

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:17.580 align:middle line:84%
All the tithes can
come here now instead

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:19.280 align:middle line:90%
of to all these other temples.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a
bit of a power grab

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.620 align:middle line:84%
and a power grab for the
high priesthood who were now

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:30.560 align:middle line:84%
the only agency of truth,
the only news agency telling

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.600 align:middle line:84%
everyone what's what
and what to believe.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So it was a huge exercise
of narrative control.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So Hilkiah and Hezekiah
start the process.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:41.420 align:middle line:90%
And then Josiah continues it.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:44.710 align:middle line:84%
He becomes king when he's
eight, if you can imagine

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:45.710 align:middle line:90%
what that would be like.

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:46.760 align:middle line:90%
That happened in Britain.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.790 align:middle line:84%
We had a nine-year-old
become king, King Edward.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And two powerful families said,
don't worry, we'll help him.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the Dudleys
and the Seymours.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And they step forward,
we'll help you, sire.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.240 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Oh, thank you so
much, grandfathers.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Uncle Dudley.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And they leveraged
their position

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:09.120 align:middle line:84%
to push forward
religious reforms,

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.980 align:middle line:84%
exactly the same thing
happened to Josiah

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.210 align:middle line:90%
when he was eight years old.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:13.410 align:middle line:90%
He became king.

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Hilkiah, from time to time,
would sidle up to him,

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I imagine, and say, sire,
I've identified another threat

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.360 align:middle line:84%
to your authority
over the kingdom.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Would you like me
to take care of it?

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Hilkiah, what
would I do without you?

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And every yes is the
demolition of another temple.

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's the slaughtering
of another priesthood

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:38.430 align:middle line:84%
until you've got one God, one
king, one high priest, one

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:42.840 align:middle line:84%
temple in Jerusalem, one neatly
ordered theocratic society

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.490 align:middle line:90%
that's very easy to run.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And that whole story has
told us-- it's not a secret.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.120 align:middle line:84%
We are told that story in
Jeremiah and Second Kings.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How did it stick
to have the staying power,

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.030 align:middle line:84%
that narrative to continue to
this very day and be exported

00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:00.330 align:middle line:84%
all over the world, and people
still operating under it?

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:02.880 align:middle line:84%
How did it get that
kind of staying power?

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: Two things happened.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Within Judaism, there
was a final redaction

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.780 align:middle line:84%
of what we now call
the Old Testament,

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.160 align:middle line:90%
the Hebrew scriptures.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And the narration is
kind of interesting

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:18.330 align:middle line:84%
because all that
information is still there.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.640 align:middle line:84%
The memory of Asherah
is still there.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.460 align:middle line:84%
The memory of Chemosh and
Dagon, it's all still there.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.430 align:middle line:84%
But what the narrator
has done in order

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:31.830 align:middle line:84%
to please his Yahwist
boss is layer an opinion

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:33.280 align:middle line:90%
over the top of it.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.940 align:middle line:84%
So when the narrator
says, the people

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:39.840 align:middle line:84%
loved Asherah and commemorated
her on every high hill

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and under every green tree and
they rejected Yahweh and spoke

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.640 align:middle line:84%
very disrespectfully
of him, the narrator

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.100 align:middle line:90%
has just told us how it was.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.400 align:middle line:84%
But then the narrator
says, isn't that awful?

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.440 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that idolatrous?

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And the moment he
says that, we feel we

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.540 align:middle line:90%
have to agree with the opinion.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.150 align:middle line:84%
But once you separate the
opinion from the information,

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:05.100 align:middle line:84%
you realize he's just
told us Judaism used

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.140 align:middle line:90%
to be all about paleocontact.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.090 align:middle line:84%
But you get to the
final redaction.

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:10.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what you have to believe.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:14.969 align:middle line:84%
And then that is what got glued
on to the apostolic writings

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.400 align:middle line:84%
to create the Bible
for Christianity.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And that was a great shame,
because in the beginning,

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:25.080 align:middle line:84%
there were church fathers, like
Origen, who I mentioned before,

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:29.219 align:middle line:84%
must come to his defense now
having said what I said before

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:31.110 align:middle line:90%
about his preaching hack.

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:35.250 align:middle line:84%
We've got Origen, Clement of
Alexandria, Justin Martyr,

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Irenaeus, and Marcion
all saying those stories

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:43.239 align:middle line:84%
of Elohim and Yahweh
are not God's stories.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:45.540 align:middle line:84%
So we're not going to
build Christianity on that.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.600 align:middle line:84%
You've got the apostolic
leaders in Acts 15

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.460 align:middle line:84%
saying we're not going to build
Christianity on the Hebrew

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:52.300 align:middle line:90%
scriptures.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.070 align:middle line:84%
All that's there
looks like it's going

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:55.337 align:middle line:90%
to go in a good direction.

00:34:55.337 --> 00:34:57.670 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to go with
the teachings of Jesus here.

00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And anyone who was
versed in Plato

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.290 align:middle line:84%
was more than ready
for Jesus's teaching

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:06.670 align:middle line:84%
because he carried on where
Plato left off, except votes

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:07.990 align:middle line:90%
went the wrong way.

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And the decision
was made to glue

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.520 align:middle line:84%
that last redaction
of the Hebrew

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.160 align:middle line:84%
scriptures onto the
apostolic writings,

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.490 align:middle line:84%
creating the
impression that the God

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:23.360 align:middle line:84%
of that redaction, the violent
Yahweh, was the God of Jesus.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And so Christians
have been entrained

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:28.540 align:middle line:84%
to believe it's a
story of continuity

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.190 align:middle line:90%
that Jesus is a Yahwist.

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And he's putting us under the
power of Yahweh once again.

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:34.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's not true.

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:36.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a story of discontinuity.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Jesus distanced himself from
Yahweh in a number of ways.

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:43.280 align:middle line:90%
It's there in the Gospel.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.650 align:middle line:84%
But because of this book,
because of these votes,

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:48.680 align:middle line:84%
because of 2,000 years
of teaching tradition,

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Christians believe they have
to defend the violent God

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:53.990 align:middle line:90%
of the Old Testament.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And so it's distorted
Christian history.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.605 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: That's why
Christian societies have done

00:35:58.605 --> 00:36:01.370 align:middle line:84%
the invading and
colonizing and enslaving.

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm arguing we need to
go back to those decisions

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:09.140 align:middle line:84%
and make fresh decisions
and see the New Testament

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:10.100 align:middle line:90%
in its own light.

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus is teaching
in its own light.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And I believe his teachings
are empowering, again,

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:18.440 align:middle line:84%
not just in terms of
political people power,

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.320 align:middle line:84%
but in terms of
ascension and discovering

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:24.592 align:middle line:84%
the real powers of human
being and what they might be.

00:36:24.592 --> 00:36:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, the
great virtues alone,

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.580 align:middle line:84%
which are archetypes
in themselves,

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:32.657 align:middle line:84%
of care and compassion and
truth and love and beauty,

00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:33.740 align:middle line:90%
it's all embedded in that.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.710 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're all trying
to awaken to and throw off

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:39.860 align:middle line:84%
the chains that have bound
us for thousands of years

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:43.530 align:middle line:84%
in this guilt tripping
thought and hierarchy, all

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:46.570 align:middle line:84%
the way through our family
systems and everything.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:47.760 align:middle line:90%
So I have a question.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is random.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And so if it's not
at all relevant,

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:52.720 align:middle line:84%
just toss this one
out, and we'll move on.

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So when you're talking
about overthrowing

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:59.340 align:middle line:84%
this very rich and
diverse belief system

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and casts of characters in the
early mystical Christian era,

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:08.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about what happened
in the 18th dynasty in Egypt

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.575 align:middle line:84%
when they came in
and said, look,

00:37:10.575 --> 00:37:14.550 align:middle line:84%
we're no longer honoring
the various gods,

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:18.690 align:middle line:84%
animal-headed gods, that we're
going directly to the sun now.

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:20.640 align:middle line:84%
We're going to the cosmos
and the sun itself,

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.600 align:middle line:90%
and you have access.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.220 align:middle line:90%
You don't need intermediaries.

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
they were heretics.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:27.180 align:middle line:84%
That was Akhenaten
and Nefertiti.

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.550 align:middle line:84%
They were heretics
and, I think, obviously

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:33.450 align:middle line:84%
had very difficult times
as a result of that.

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:35.520 align:middle line:84%
It's been attempted,
at the time,

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.470 align:middle line:84%
to destroy any evidence
they even existed.

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:38.970 align:middle line:90%
But how does that--

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:42.120 align:middle line:84%
which was also a narrowing
down of beliefs because people

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.380 align:middle line:84%
believed in their kitchen
god and their grain god

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.190 align:middle line:90%
and so forth?

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:48.020 align:middle line:90%
Do those align at all?

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: Well, it's almost
a counterpart story because I

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.650 align:middle line:84%
think Akhenaten was offering
something very positive--

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I do too.

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.228 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: --with this
monotheistic view.

00:37:57.228 --> 00:37:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Politically, obviously,
it was a problem

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:02.590 align:middle line:84%
because it was disempowering
all these other priesthoods.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Who made
their living that way.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: Exactly.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.350 align:middle line:90%
So it was a big deal.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And there was trouble
because of it.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of a
counterpart story.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.870 align:middle line:84%
There is power and beauty
in the idea of monotheism

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:19.820 align:middle line:84%
because it is teaching us not
to bow down to other powers,

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:23.900 align:middle line:84%
not to give our power
away to powerful figures

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:28.490 align:middle line:84%
and to give the
redactors their credit.

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:31.490 align:middle line:84%
When that rewrite of the
Old Testament was done,

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:34.520 align:middle line:84%
that was part of the message
they wished to convey.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:38.030 align:middle line:84%
There's only one God and
source of the cosmos.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.310 align:middle line:90%
That's a very positive message.

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:45.270 align:middle line:84%
But, unfortunately, they used
the name of Yahweh for that God

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and then pasted it
over the earlier texts

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.790 align:middle line:84%
so that monotheism
became muddied

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:52.630 align:middle line:90%
with all these other things.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And I find sometimes
even the word

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:57.900 align:middle line:84%
God is very difficult
for people to do business

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:02.640 align:middle line:84%
with because, immediately,
all the ideas of obedience,

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.598 align:middle line:84%
punishment, fear will
click into place.

00:39:05.598 --> 00:39:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of
the great insights

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:11.820 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus came with is that
if you can transcend fear,

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.100 align:middle line:90%
you can have an amazing life.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.490 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful summary of
his teaching at the beginning

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:18.960 align:middle line:90%
of Matthew's gospel.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'll cut to the chase
and go to the root meanings.

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:24.120 align:middle line:84%
No, I tell you the
translation first

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.530 align:middle line:90%
because it's kind of funny.

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:28.410 align:middle line:84%
The familiar
translation is repent

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.870 align:middle line:84%
for the kingdom of
heaven is at hand.

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:32.850 align:middle line:90%
Now, that sounds like a warning.

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Repent means clean your life up
because God's about to show up,

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and you wouldn't want to get
on the wrong side of him.

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're
about to be judged.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.022 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: You're
about to be judged.

00:39:41.022 --> 00:39:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And we hear it that way because
of 2,000 years of angry God

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:44.880 align:middle line:90%
teaching.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.070 align:middle line:90%
Go to the root meanings.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:51.110 align:middle line:84%
What he's actually saying
is go beyond the mind

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:55.460 align:middle line:84%
because the powers and
principles of the cosmos

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.010 align:middle line:90%
are available to you.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, could there be
any greater invitation

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:03.390 align:middle line:84%
to explore what's
possible than that?

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And then when he adds to
that, the power and principles

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:10.400 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos are within
you, that's even better.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying if you look
deeply within yourself,

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.810 align:middle line:90%
you'll find the cosmos.

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:16.580 align:middle line:90%
Look deeply into the universe.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.080 align:middle line:90%
You'll find yourself.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not just being
elevated by a better

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:23.150 align:middle line:90%
ethical way of thinking.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:27.050 align:middle line:84%
It's, oh my goodness,
what is possible for us?

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And many ancient
traditions of wisdom

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:35.990 align:middle line:84%
point to our ability to ascend,
to become more conscious, more

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:39.260 align:middle line:84%
intelligent, to access
higher cognitive powers.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:42.050 align:middle line:84%
We watch Jesus do it
all through the gospels.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And then he turns around and
says, and you can do this too.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:48.063 align:middle line:90%
And I find that rather exciting.

00:40:48.063 --> 00:40:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.970 align:middle line:84%
So I think people listening to
this, many who take exception

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:55.910 align:middle line:84%
to the word God, obviously,
because of the way

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:59.010 align:middle line:84%
it's been used really in
a tyrannical way almost

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:02.550 align:middle line:84%
in their lives, to be able
to change that reflection out

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:04.830 align:middle line:90%
to the creative source of all.

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: Yes.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The
creative source of all.

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: That's right.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.900 align:middle line:84%
My wife, Ruth, doesn't
use the word God.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.610 align:middle line:84%
She talks about
divine intelligence.

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes,
divine intelligence.

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And if all of that is reflected
in us, and we're part of that.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.470 align:middle line:84%
I deal with a lot of
different authors who

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:22.350 align:middle line:84%
talk about not just
paleocontact, but modern day

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:25.380 align:middle line:84%
contact and all the various
species who have come,

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.440 align:middle line:84%
who have visited, who have
left information for us.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And it seems, indeed, that there
are many benevolent others,

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:36.540 align:middle line:84%
interdimensionally and
otherwise, who are here

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:38.190 align:middle line:90%
to help us remember that.

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: Here to help.

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's just
such a persistent story.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:43.530 align:middle line:84%
We give our power away
to everyone, our dentist,

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:45.100 align:middle line:84%
our doctor, our
priest, or everybody.

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.308 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: Yes, that's right.

00:41:46.308 --> 00:41:48.570 align:middle line:84%
It's empowering to know
that each one of us

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:51.060 align:middle line:84%
has an invisible team
of helpers around us.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be told that if
you go to southern Africa,

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:55.123 align:middle line:90%
a sangoma or a n'anga.

00:41:55.123 --> 00:41:56.790 align:middle line:84%
A traditional healer
will tell you that.

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:59.460 align:middle line:84%
It's actually there in
the New Testament as well.

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:02.940 align:middle line:84%
In Hebrews 12, it speaks
about ancestral spirits

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.910 align:middle line:84%
very interested in
us running our race.

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:07.500 align:middle line:84%
They're interested
in our progress.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.960 align:middle line:84%
They want to see what
we do with their DNA.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.730 align:middle line:90%
And they want us to succeed.

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:15.270 align:middle line:84%
1 John 4, we can expect
helpers to come along.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:17.850 align:middle line:84%
The writer says, spirits,
but he never quite

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:20.670 align:middle line:84%
defines who they are
or what they are.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And what fascinates me
about that verse is he says,

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.420 align:middle line:90%
don't believe every spirit.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.530 align:middle line:90%
Test them.

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:30.450 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to get
some good information

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:32.610 align:middle line:90%
if you're willing to do that.

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:35.350 align:middle line:84%
What's exciting about
that is, first of all,

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:38.310 align:middle line:84%
we should all expect
contact experiences.

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And second of all, we should
all keep our sovereignty.

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I need to weigh up, do
I think that's right?

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.090 align:middle line:90%
Is that helpful?

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:47.020 align:middle line:90%
Do I need to act on that or not?

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And that was part of
primitive Christianity.

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a very empowering way of
engaging where you expect help.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.980 align:middle line:84%
But you expect to be
a sovereign being.

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:57.240 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.070 align:middle line:90%
It never gets preached on.

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:00.630 align:middle line:90%
It gets brushed aside.

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:04.830 align:middle line:84%
But it's a little vestige of
what primitive Christianity

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:05.940 align:middle line:90%
really was.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.357 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And where we're
headed because the gig is about

00:43:08.357 --> 00:43:09.400 align:middle line:90%
up for the other forces.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the people
of the Philippines

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:14.160 align:middle line:84%
and elsewhere that have
turned against the notion

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.655 align:middle line:84%
of enslavement to a
God giving up their--

00:43:17.655 --> 00:43:21.510 align:middle line:84%
whether it's lamb and beef
and virgins and gold or what.

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:24.030 align:middle line:84%
I think, in general,
the world is getting

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:25.523 align:middle line:90%
kind of tired of that story.

00:43:25.523 --> 00:43:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: I think so.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:30.360 align:middle line:84%
I think we're waking up to
the dark side of history

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.830 align:middle line:90%
and saying, no more of that.

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:33.780 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.990 align:middle line:84%
But more and more people are
waking up to their helpers

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.950 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:39.900 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of
coaching with people.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And, often, I'll
say, do you know

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm coming to believe
that each one of us

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.020 align:middle line:84%
has a little invisible
team of helpers?

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And I've yet to find a
client who doesn't say,

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm coming to believe that too.

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:54.810 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't taught
it in church or at school.

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:57.670 align:middle line:84%
They're discovering it
through their experience

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:00.060 align:middle line:84%
and through their
intuition firing

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.810 align:middle line:84%
off better than it
has in the past.

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:05.350 align:middle line:84%
But if you speak this publicly
among family, friends,

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:06.990 align:middle line:84%
work colleagues,
and so forth, you're

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:10.420 align:middle line:84%
considered a bit of a wing
nut, new ager, or whatnot.

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:12.150 align:middle line:90%
And so that has to start.

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:14.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's getting better.

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:16.500 align:middle line:84%
People are starting to see
that there's some truth.

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm that person in my family.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:20.880 align:middle line:84%
But some of the things I
tell them have come to pass.

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.983 align:middle line:84%
And now they don't make
fun of me so much anymore.

00:44:22.983 --> 00:44:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: Oh, good for you.

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:25.192 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And it's true.

00:44:25.192 --> 00:44:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense, when people
say, oh, I'm just so alone,

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:30.270 align:middle line:84%
I think, how can
you feel alone when

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:33.010 align:middle line:84%
you're surrounded by all of
this that you can engage with,

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:33.810 align:middle line:90%
talk to?

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:35.670 align:middle line:84%
They're there to help
you every minute.

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: Sometimes I think
people just need a little

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.850 align:middle line:90%
nudge.

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask
them, have you ever

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:44.220 align:middle line:84%
felt that you had a
little bit of assistance,

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.980 align:middle line:84%
surprising coincidences, a
thought that came to you,

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.990 align:middle line:90%
everyone has these experiences.

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:51.270 align:middle line:84%
You just need to shine
a little light on them.

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:53.170 align:middle line:90%
We're out of time.

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:54.690 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts before we go?

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:55.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:57.510 align:middle line:84%
I just love the
way you lay it out.

00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:58.410 align:middle line:90%
You're so articulate.

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:01.305 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for doing the hard
work, the academic work for us.

00:45:01.305 --> 00:45:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: Well, thank you.

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, my final
thought is something

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.380 align:middle line:84%
that I take from the
Gnostic writings, which

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:11.580 align:middle line:84%
is to do with archons, which
feed off negative emotion.

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And they manipulate us and
push us into dark spaces.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And my insight from
that is we need

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:20.130 align:middle line:84%
to be very intentional
about our emotional state

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:21.240 align:middle line:90%
and our mental state.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.320 align:middle line:84%
We need to look out
for one another.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.560 align:middle line:10%
And if your friend
is going into a funk

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:28.393 align:middle line:10%
or if you're going into a
funk, don't let that happen.

00:45:28.393 --> 00:45:29.310 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>> WALLIS: Before
you get out of bed,

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:32.280 align:middle line:84%
before you step
out the front door,

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:36.070 align:middle line:84%
decide what energy you're going
to put into your interactions.

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
intentional about it,

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.870 align:middle line:84%
you'll put forward
a positive energy.

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:41.490 align:middle line:90%
And it will be reflected back.

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And you'll have a better day,
and so will everyone around you

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:45.090 align:middle line:90%
so.

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:47.382 align:middle line:84%
That's an insight I love that
the early Christians had.

00:45:47.382 --> 00:45:48.882 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I totally
agree with you.

00:45:48.882 --> 00:45:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And you're not feeding
the beast anymore.

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:51.532 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: Exactly.

00:45:51.532 --> 00:45:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Paul,
thank you so much.

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:55.707 align:middle line:84%
I hope to see you here on
this side again one day.

00:45:55.707 --> 00:45:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>> WALLIS: Thanks, Regina.

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:57.972 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

00:45:57.972 --> 00:46:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I hope you found
this conversation enlightening,

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:01.750 align:middle line:90%
even if it's a bit challenging.

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:12.940 align:middle line:90%
