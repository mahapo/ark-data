>>REGINA MEREDITH: We're
going to take a look

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.310 align:middle line:10%
at the life of one
of the greatest

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.640 align:middle line:10%
and most scandalous scientific
minds of the 16th century,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.580 align:middle line:10%
a man who heavily influenced
Queen Elizabeth's court.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.200 align:middle line:10%
His name is John Dee.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:84%
His hierarchical
understanding of unseen

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:84%
forces reach into and
affect our world in terms

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.370 align:middle line:90%
of religion and politics.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Jason Louv is here today
to share his research

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.120 align:middle line:84%
on this amazing, fascinating,
confusing historical figure.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.260 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Jason.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JASON LOUV: Thank you
for having me on, Regina.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wow, what
a beautiful work

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.370 align:middle line:90%
you have done with your book.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely amazing.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Thank you.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: "John Dee and
the Empire Of Angels."

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.080 align:middle line:10%
>>LOUV: Uh-huh.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.560 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And you really put a
lot of really rigorous research

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.540 align:middle line:10%
around it, where other
people have looked

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:10%
at it more esoterically
and there's

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.727 align:middle line:10%
a lot of conjecture
in some of the books,

00:01:05.727 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:10%
I think you've really nailed it.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:90%
So this man is still--

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.120 align:middle line:84%
his work, his influence, is
still reaching into our times

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.470 align:middle line:84%
now, both in terms of
religion and politics.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's really
valuable for people

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.554 align:middle line:84%
to understand the genesis of
some of this thought, some

00:01:19.554 --> 00:01:20.470 align:middle line:90%
of these philosophies.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.040 align:middle line:84%
So without further ado,
let's go into the life

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:90%
and times of John Dee.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Give us a context
for his life, OK.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Sure.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:10%
So the reason this
person is so important

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.370 align:middle line:10%
is because in our culture, at
a certain point in our history,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.940 align:middle line:10%
science and magic diverged.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.510 align:middle line:90%
They used to be the same thing.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:84%
People who were
interested in science

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.750 align:middle line:84%
were also interested in the
esoteric side of things.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And then they split and
they went their own ways.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And science became modern
science and magic kind of

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.740 align:middle line:90%
went off into its own world.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.320 align:middle line:84%
But John Dee, who was
the scientific advisor

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.530 align:middle line:84%
to Queen Elizabeth I and one
of the most brilliant people

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.280 align:middle line:84%
of the 16th century,
the person who

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.000 align:middle line:84%
was responsible for bringing
mathematics to the public,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.880 align:middle line:84%
for coming up with the
phrase, the "British Empire,"

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and laying down
the plans for there

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
to be a British
empire, who really laid

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.690 align:middle line:84%
the groundwork for
modern science to happen,

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.660 align:middle line:84%
was also completely
fascinated with magic

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:90%
and the esoteric world.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And is maybe one of the
most brilliant thinkers

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.620 align:middle line:90%
that spirituality has produced.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And is one of the rare people
who synthesized the two.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.089 align:middle line:84%
And I say synthesized,
but really

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:25.380 align:middle line:90%
they just hadn't separated yet.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.010 align:middle line:90%
And they were the same thing.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.726 align:middle line:84%
So in our modern world,
we're coming to a point

00:02:29.726 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:84%
now as a culture
where these things are

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.760 align:middle line:90%
starting to come back together.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And people are
interested in both,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:84%
are interested in science,
wonderfully so, and also

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.082 align:middle line:84%
interested in
spirituality, and magic,

00:02:40.082 --> 00:02:42.540 align:middle line:84%
and the esoteric side of things
because they want something

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:90%
deeper.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.720 align:middle line:84%
They want a deeper experience
of life and understanding

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.270 align:middle line:90%
what being alive means.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.960 align:middle line:84%
But they want to figure
that out on their own terms,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.350 align:middle line:84%
without it being imposed
by, like, a top-down church

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.850 align:middle line:90%
or something like that usually.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So for that reason, I think
he's a fascinating person

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.967 align:middle line:84%
for us to learn from and
just to understand ourselves,

00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:05.800 align:middle line:84%
and where we've been,
and where we're going.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.966 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:03:06.966 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And to the point, Dean
Radin, a scientist

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.880 align:middle line:84%
and paranormal researcher,
both, especially

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
quantum entanglement,

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.930 align:middle line:84%
just came out with a new book
called "Real Magic," right?

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yes.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now starting
to boldly, even embrace

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.590 align:middle line:84%
the title, to bring the
two together in this world.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.720 align:middle line:84%
So you're right
on target on that.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
problems is that people

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:84%
have learned to be very
polarized in their thinking

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:84%
and do not understand that these
characters, throughout history,

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.580 align:middle line:84%
most of them were very
"colorful people."

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And we say, how can someone
who would do such a thing also

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.350 align:middle line:90%
come up with such a thing?

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.975 align:middle line:10%
And so we're going
to get into some

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:50.400 align:middle line:10%
of that, some of the
contrast within John

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:10%
Dee, his personal character,
also Edward Kelley,

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.500 align:middle line:10%
who he associated with, who
brought through, channeled

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.720 align:middle line:10%
information and help
people understand

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:10%
and get comfortable
with the notion,

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.428 align:middle line:10%
you don't have to be a saint
to be brilliant and make

00:04:01.428 --> 00:04:03.120 align:middle line:10%
a contribution to society.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's true today as well.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.100 align:middle line:84%
So Francis Bacon,
wasn't Francis Bacon

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.420 align:middle line:84%
more or less a
contemporary in the day?

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: He was very
inspired by Dee.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.200 align:middle line:90%
Bacon came after Dee.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And Francis Bacon, of course,
created the Baconian method,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.709 align:middle line:90%
which became empirical science.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:84%
But he was very influenced
by Dee's thinking.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all of these guys were,
Francis Bacon, Rene Descartes,

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.600 align:middle line:84%
the early scientists who became
the Royal Society in England.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:84%
All of the early
scientists were totally

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:84%
fascinated by Dee's
work because Dee

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.860 align:middle line:84%
was the person who had laid
the groundwork for science

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.660 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.090 align:middle line:84%
But they were also interested
in magic and the esoteric.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.020 align:middle line:84%
They were fascinated with
the idea of Rosicrucianism

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and the Rosicrucian
brotherhood, which

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:84%
was this kind of story
that was being told

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.300 align:middle line:84%
around Europe that there was
this secret group of people

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:84%
working to enlighten Europe,
to bring science to Europe,

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.910 align:middle line:84%
to get Europe away from the
domination of the Church.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.639 align:middle line:90%
This all comes from Dee.

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Previously, you
mentioned that people

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.280 align:middle line:84%
are very polarized in
their thinking now.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.840 align:middle line:90%
It's either magic or science.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And neither of these
camps talk to each other.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And I come across
this myself a lot.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:84%
My way of seeing it is
the same that they did,

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.220 align:middle line:84%
which is there's really
only one thing going on,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.330 align:middle line:84%
which is humanity's
quest for knowledge,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and humanity's quest to make
life better and learn more

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.890 align:middle line:90%
about the universe.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And the spiritual side of
things is a tool for that.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.120 align:middle line:84%
The scientific, purely
materialistic science side,

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:90%
is a tool to do that.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.420 align:middle line:84%
But these guys were
thinking in one

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.025 align:middle line:84%
big-- they were big
picture thinkers.

00:05:37.025 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's the type of
thinking that I really

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.955 align:middle line:90%
want to encourage.

00:05:39.955 --> 00:05:41.330 align:middle line:84%
We should be
thinking, how can we

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
make the best possible
scientific advances,

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.230 align:middle line:90%
with science on its own plain?

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.640 align:middle line:84%
How can we also bring people
the best spiritual technologies,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.970 align:middle line:84%
if you will, to make
them happy and foster

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.880 align:middle line:84%
a sense of connection, and
well-being, and happiness

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.070 align:middle line:84%
in life, understanding life,
and putting it in context,

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.640 align:middle line:90%
and what it really is?

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very inspired
by those guys.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:90%
And they were--

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you're the
classic new representation

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.520 align:middle line:90%
of a Renaissance man.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Well, thank you.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:90%
I hope so.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You are.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.172 align:middle line:90%
You truly are.

00:06:14.172 --> 00:06:15.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And so, at the same time,
when you look at Bacon,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.520 align:middle line:84%
for example, what
an incredible mind.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:84%
What many think to be
the actual, at least part

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:84%
of, or if not, the better part
of the body of Shakespeare's

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.130 align:middle line:90%
work, authorship of that.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I think that in
the intelligentsia

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.710 align:middle line:90%
circles is kind of accepted.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:84%
But then also, under contract,
to rewrite the King James

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.160 align:middle line:90%
version of the Bible.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, again,
how did you perceive

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.660 align:middle line:84%
that part of his
role in the world,

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.600 align:middle line:84%
to rewrite the Bible into
this everlasting, at least

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.420 align:middle line:84%
the last few hundred years,
King James version of the Bible?

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Well, it's a
fascinating question.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And there was so much
going on at this time.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Those guys, both Bacon,
Shakespeare, John Dee,

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.370 align:middle line:84%
of course, they were
all working together.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.090 align:middle line:10%
There was a lot going on behind
the scenes, some of which

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.970 align:middle line:10%
is historically accepted and
some of which is conjecture.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's just very
clear to me, observing

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.610 align:middle line:84%
that period in history, that
there was a group of very, very

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.740 align:middle line:84%
intelligent people, a
real intelligentsia, who

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.510 align:middle line:84%
were working with
everything they

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.840 align:middle line:84%
had to modernize
Europe and bring

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:24.650 align:middle line:84%
new ideas of spirituality, and
scientific advance, and world

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.170 align:middle line:84%
exploration, and art, and drama,
in the case of Shakespeare,

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.892 align:middle line:84%
and then, yes, the
modernization of the Bible.

00:07:30.892 --> 00:07:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And the fascinating
thing about all these

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.300 align:middle line:84%
is the real common
thread with all of them

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.080 align:middle line:84%
is the faith in the
liberation of human beings

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.080 align:middle line:84%
from superstition and control,
the idea that human beings

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.260 align:middle line:84%
should be free to
pursue happiness,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.470 align:middle line:84%
to pursue scientific truth,
to pursue religious truth

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.850 align:middle line:90%
on their own terms.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ideas
that became America.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.320 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
were manifested finally

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.741 align:middle line:84%
as the United States, which
was a project of these guys,

00:07:56.741 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:90%
including Francis Bacon.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The new Atlantis.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Absolutely.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
interesting because, again,

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.290 align:middle line:90%
when we go into these layers--

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and we'll wrap it up on Bacon
in a second and the King James

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:06.740 align:middle line:90%
version--

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:90%
here you have this--

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.155 align:middle line:84%
again, this has withstood
some test of time.

00:08:12.155 --> 00:08:17.000 align:middle line:84%
The last I read, that there
were 26,000 versions of the New

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.080 align:middle line:90%
Testament alone that exist.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.300 align:middle line:84%
But in this particular
one, the dominant one,

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.830 align:middle line:84%
it's used almost in a
fundamentalist way because

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.790 align:middle line:84%
of our lack of
nuance in thinking.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at it from an
intelligence point of view,

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.750 align:middle line:84%
it's said to be
written in layers

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.210 align:middle line:84%
of understanding for those
with eyes to see that.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:84%
It actually had quite a
lot of these Renaissance

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.630 align:middle line:84%
understandings of magic,
science, and life embedded

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.960 align:middle line:84%
in the actual text of the King
James version of the Bible,

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:84%
if you can see it,
and see the patterns.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Absolutely.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at it, there's
so many different versions

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.170 align:middle line:90%
of the Bible.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: But if you look at the
King James-- and the King James

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.790 align:middle line:84%
is not even necessarily the
most academically accurate one

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.170 align:middle line:84%
because things have
moved around so much.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: But the language
is so beautiful.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.680 align:middle line:90%
The language is incredible.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And absolutely, there's
layered meaning in there.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.420 align:middle line:84%
You have to remember
that at this time period,

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.350 align:middle line:90%
they didn't have TV.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.600 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have the internet.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So they loved to play
intellectual games.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.300 align:middle line:90%
I mean, people knew Greek.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.100 align:middle line:90%
They knew Latin.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.330 align:middle line:90%
They knew Hebrew.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.670 align:middle line:84%
They loved to play word
games, and puzzles,

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and translate things
back and forth.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And that was how intelligent
people stimulated their minds.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.479 align:middle line:90%
And it was a common language.

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you go back and look
at these things, which

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I spent a lot of time
doing, writing this,

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.276 align:middle line:84%
you see that you're dealing
with a much higher caliber

00:09:31.276 --> 00:09:32.150 align:middle line:90%
of thinking than is--

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: --common now.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:39.266 align:middle line:84%
In the sense is, if somebody was
watching our TV shows a hundred

00:09:39.266 --> 00:09:40.640 align:middle line:84%
years from now,
they're not going

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.840 align:middle line:90%
to get all the little jokes.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.381 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to get little winks

00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:90%
and pop cultural references.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.950 align:middle line:90%
It's the same there.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.680 align:middle line:84%
But the winks and the
pop culture references

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:84%
are layers of spiritual
meaning, and Kabbalah,

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.570 align:middle line:84%
and Rosicrucianism,
and esoterism,

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:84%
and, as you said, things
that are there for people

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.430 align:middle line:90%
who have eyes to see.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.512 align:middle line:84%
And it's thrilling to
go back and find it.

00:09:59.512 --> 00:10:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it is, especially
when you open to the notion

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.280 align:middle line:84%
that these men also had an
understanding of the cosmos.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And not just cosmology,
but astronomy-- astrology,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.180 align:middle line:84%
in Dee's case, and
understanding astrology.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.250 align:middle line:84%
So if we understand
that all of them

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:20.030 align:middle line:84%
had a relative understanding
of our cosmological connection,

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.874 align:middle line:84%
that we are universal
beings in a larger system,

00:10:22.874 --> 00:10:24.290 align:middle line:84%
then you start
reading these texts

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.470 align:middle line:84%
and it starts looking
entirely different again.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.950 align:middle line:84%
So there are these
layers over layers.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And so that wraps
the Bacon part.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to say that, yeah,
he did that under contract.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it can be used in
a fundamentalist way,

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.090 align:middle line:84%
just like any of the
work of these guys.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Or, yes, it can be
absolutely magical.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's up to us to develop a
nuance in our own understanding

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:47.210 align:middle line:90%
and intelligence.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.168 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: It's important.

00:10:48.168 --> 00:10:49.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just to
wrap that up also.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.854 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: It's
important to realize

00:10:51.854 --> 00:10:53.840 align:middle line:84%
that for exactly the
point that you mentioned,

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.340 align:middle line:84%
which is people go
back to that text

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and read it totally
literally, totally

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.600 align:middle line:90%
as a fundamental reading.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:84%
What they're missing is
all the layers of metaphor,

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.620 align:middle line:84%
and simile, and then
the artistic metaphors.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And then underneath,
the artistic metaphors,

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:90%
the coded meanings and Kabbalah.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.486 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The cosmic,
and all of it, yeah.

00:11:11.486 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: It's
beautiful, you know.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.985 align:middle line:90%
So you look at Shakespeare.

00:11:13.985 --> 00:11:16.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people can barely
read Shakespeare now.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.538 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: You think about how
many layered meanings are

00:11:19.538 --> 00:11:20.960 align:middle line:84%
in Shakespeare
and you apply that

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.150 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual texts
of that time period.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And you can't make a
fundamentalist reading of it.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: It's too surface.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.060 align:middle line:84%
So you're attempting to bring
back the nuance into all of it.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:37.850 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into his
understanding, Elizabethan

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.170 align:middle line:90%
hierarchy of the day.

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.820 align:middle line:84%
They did believe
that there was a God.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.890 align:middle line:84%
There were angels, and
there were intermediaries,

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:44.330 align:middle line:90%
and demons, and so forth.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how John
Dee perceived that world.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Absolutely.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:51.570 align:middle line:84%
So the Renaissance
view of the world

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.680 align:middle line:84%
and the medieval view of the
world was basically this.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.510 align:middle line:90%
It's everything is one thing.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we see
that is perceivable is God.

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:02.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's all one system.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And it works
functionally, perfectly.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.532 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
like a watch, where

00:12:06.532 --> 00:12:08.240 align:middle line:84%
all the gears are
wound up and everything

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.115 align:middle line:90%
is working perfectly.

00:12:09.115 --> 00:12:11.330 align:middle line:84%
All the parts are
working perfectly.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.920 align:middle line:90%
And we've lost that.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, we see the world is
chaotic and meaningless.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.329 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everything separate.

00:12:16.329 --> 00:12:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Everything separate.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.520 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's a flaw
in our consciousness,

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.330 align:middle line:84%
rather than that our
understanding has changed.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:28.010 align:middle line:84%
But the way that people saw it
at the time was as a hierarchy.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.410 align:middle line:84%
You had God at the top,
followed by the angels, followed

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:34.400 align:middle line:84%
by people, then followed by
animals, plants, minerals.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you got to the lower
spirits, the infernal realms.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.420 align:middle line:84%
But they saw everything
as interconnected.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Or holographic is the
best way to talk about it.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.580 align:middle line:84%
If you take a-- a
classic metaphor--

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.280 align:middle line:84%
if you take a printed
hologram, not a projected one,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:84%
like a-- they used to have
hologram stickers that came in

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:90%
and trading cards.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Right.

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So you take one of those and
you cut it up into seven pieces.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Each of the smaller pieces will
contain the entire hologram.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.580 align:middle line:84%
That's how people saw
reality as working.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.610 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if man
was made in God's image,

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.970 align:middle line:84%
then you could understand God
by understanding the human

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:90%
and by seeing nature.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And all these things
were in resonance.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.160 align:middle line:84%
There's the classic
William Blake line,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:84%
I could see eternity
on a grain of sand.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: That's basically
what they're talking about.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very comforting
worldview view for people.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:29.480 align:middle line:84%
It was a world where everything
made sense and was in order.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:84%
There was an inherent
orderliness to it.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And so that was also John Dee's
own internal belief system.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Uh-huh.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.190 align:middle line:90%
It was.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was the world view
of scientists at the time.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:90%
So now we think of science--

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.830 align:middle line:84%
science had a very different
flavor at the time.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, we think of science
as moving forward

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.840 align:middle line:90%
in time, as being progressive.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.150 align:middle line:84%
We're discovering new
things about the world.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.390 align:middle line:84%
In the Renaissance
period, the scientists

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:84%
of the time, the
protoscientists,

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.620 align:middle line:84%
believed that knowledge
was degrading over time,

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.900 align:middle line:90%
instead of getting better.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.858 align:middle line:84%
They thought that
essentially perfect knowledge

00:14:07.858 --> 00:14:11.540 align:middle line:84%
had been given to mankind by
God in the Garden of Eden.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And then it was lost during
the fall of the Tower of Babel.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And more was lost during
the fall of Rome and Greece.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Remember, they were coming
out of the Dark Ages.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.091 align:middle line:84%
They were just
recovering knowledge.

00:14:20.091 --> 00:14:21.715 align:middle line:84%
They were just
recovering the knowledge

00:14:21.715 --> 00:14:23.180 align:middle line:90%
of the classical world.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:84%
So their view was
we have to go back

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.340 align:middle line:90%
and recover what we've lost.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.089 align:middle line:84%
So they were looking
backwards and saying,

00:14:28.089 --> 00:14:30.950 align:middle line:84%
if only we can get to the
original knowledge that we had,

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.100 align:middle line:90%
then we'll understand.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And John Dee's way of thinking
was even more extreme,

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.220 align:middle line:84%
which was, what if we can
connect directly to God

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.140 align:middle line:90%
and ask him?

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.723 align:middle line:84%
And if we can't do
that, then maybe we

00:14:39.723 --> 00:14:41.750 align:middle line:84%
can talk to God's
angels at least,

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:45.170 align:middle line:84%
who might be a bit more ready
to have a conversation with us,

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.700 align:middle line:90%
a bit closer to our level.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.600 align:middle line:84%
That was their way
of seeing things.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And so John Dee pursued
this quest with everything

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.540 align:middle line:84%
that he had because
he thought that that

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.610 align:middle line:84%
was the way to learning,
to getting more light,

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.410 align:middle line:90%
more knowledge.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
perfectly logical.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean really, if
you take a babe

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.870 align:middle line:84%
and let him grow
up naturally, this

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.430 align:middle line:84%
is what we would
evolve to, is trying

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
to understand the invisible
principles that make something

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.080 align:middle line:90%
so.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And so they were just,
I think, operating

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:16.464 align:middle line:84%
on very natural principles
and asking that question.

00:15:16.464 --> 00:15:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you can bring it through,
through the hierarchy of beings

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.690 align:middle line:84%
who inform, it makes
even more sense.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And then once
scientific materialism

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:84%
became the religion, so
to speak, all of that's

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:26.930 align:middle line:90%
been blocked.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And a massive amount
of real understanding

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.630 align:middle line:84%
has been blocked at certain
levels, not at the top level,

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.240 align:middle line:84%
but at that next tier down,
and the next tier down.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Because at the top
level, it seems

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.660 align:middle line:84%
to be there are
always those who are

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.530 align:middle line:84%
able to use both
realms of information,

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:84%
all realms of information,
to their benefit

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yeah.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:49.846 align:middle line:84%
I think that people who
are really intelligent

00:15:49.846 --> 00:15:51.890 align:middle line:84%
and naturally curious,
and who have not

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
lost their curiosity,
as so many of us

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:58.070 align:middle line:84%
do because of how we're
educated and how our society is,

00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:59.436 align:middle line:90%
it's a natural way of thinking.

00:15:59.436 --> 00:16:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I think that people who
are naturally curious

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:05.450 align:middle line:84%
see things in the
big picture way.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And they're just curious
about why are we alive?

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.020 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
afraid to look in lots

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.560 align:middle line:84%
of different-- lots
of different areas

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.070 align:middle line:84%
to try and understand
that question.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.714 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk about the
other side of his personality.

00:16:17.714 --> 00:16:19.130 align:middle line:84%
He was all these
brilliant things.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Why was he in
prison for sorcery,

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:22.780 align:middle line:90%
and conjuring, and all this?

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And in addition, how did this
affect his need to really put

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:90%
forth science in the world?

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Right.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So Dee lived in a very
politically dangerous period

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.810 align:middle line:90%
of history.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.660 align:middle line:84%
England at the time had
just left the Church.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.820 align:middle line:84%
They'd kind of done
their own Brexit.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And Henry had separated
the Anglican church

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.350 align:middle line:90%
from the Catholic church.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And so what that
meant was there was

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:52.070 align:middle line:84%
war, spiritual war between the
Catholics and the Protestants.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And Queen Mary, who was Henry's
daughter-- when Henry died,

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Queen Mary became queen.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:90%
And she was Catholic.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And so there was kind of
a Catholic reconquering

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.350 align:middle line:90%
of England.

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
were burned as heretics

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.089 align:middle line:84%
or imprisoned as heretics
who were Protestants.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:10.609 align:middle line:84%
And then when she
died, then Elizabeth

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:90%
came in, who was Protestant.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.210 align:middle line:90%
And so it was back and forth.

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.990 align:middle line:84%
We've seen that fight on
even to the modern day.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.700 align:middle line:84%
In Ireland, for instance,
this is a serious thing.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.920 align:middle line:84%
So Dee was a confidante
and a friend of Elizabeth.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.839 align:middle line:84%
And at one point had been
asked by her actually just

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:30.140 align:middle line:84%
to do astrological
charts, of all things.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.290 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:34.370 align:middle line:84%
He had been asked to draw
birth charts of Elizabeth

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.245 align:middle line:90%
and potentially Mary.

00:17:35.245 --> 00:17:37.078 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Royalty has
always been interested

00:17:37.078 --> 00:17:38.630 align:middle line:84%
in astrology and
the big picture.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Of course, to this day.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To this day.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: It's kind
of their thing.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: It's big in England.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: But he was
found out doing this.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And this was a
punishable offense.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:90%
It was considered sorcery.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.720 align:middle line:10%
They assumed that
Elizabeth and Dee

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.800 align:middle line:10%
were conspiring to somehow
use magic to unseat

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.840 align:middle line:10%
Queen Mary from the throne.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.020 align:middle line:84%
All he'd done was
draw up birth charts.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.650 align:middle line:84%
But for this, he was imprisoned
in the Tower of London,

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.180 align:middle line:90%
with other Protestant heretics.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:90%
He was tortured.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.930 align:middle line:84%
He was forced to reconvene
to Catholicism publicly.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:13.760 align:middle line:90%
It was a mess.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And he was in that situation
until the regime changed

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:90%
and Elizabeth became queen.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So it definitely
changed his attitude.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Before that, you
have to remember,

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.030 align:middle line:84%
this person was a pure
academic, somebody who was just

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.050 align:middle line:90%
seeking after knowledge.

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:30.380 align:middle line:84%
He truly believed in bringing
higher knowledge to humanity.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.540 align:middle line:84%
He truly believed
in England and doing

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.790 align:middle line:90%
what was best for his country.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.320 align:middle line:90%
And I think it was very--

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.000 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.967 align:middle line:84%
it definitely changed him
to get that treatment.

00:18:42.967 --> 00:18:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How did it change him?

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.925 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Well, I think
as you mentioned,

00:18:45.925 --> 00:18:49.037 align:middle line:84%
he spent a lot of time trying
to resuscitate his reputation,

00:18:49.037 --> 00:18:50.120 align:middle line:90%
until the end of his life.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.772 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to convince
people that he was a true--

00:18:52.772 --> 00:18:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He wasn't a nutter.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: --Christian.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:90%
He was a true scientist.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.300 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't a black magician.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: And they were
constantly accusing him of that.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.390 align:middle line:84%
The irony is that
the other side,

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:04.640 align:middle line:84%
on Queen Mary's side
and the Catholic side,

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.944 align:middle line:84%
they were using black magic
to try and get their goals,

00:19:07.944 --> 00:19:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and to attack the queen--
and Queen Elizabeth,

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:10.790 align:middle line:90%
and all of this.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.500 align:middle line:90%
So it was a messy time.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Anyway, OK.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about math,
and his love of math

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.890 align:middle line:84%
and how this feeds into his
esoteric understanding of life

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:19.690 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Oh, it's fascinating.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:22.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean people hear math
and they immediately--

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.870 align:middle line:90%
it's like an allergic reaction.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.070 align:middle line:90%
Oh, God.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.195 align:middle line:84%
But when you understand it
the way that Dee saw it,

00:19:27.195 --> 00:19:29.120 align:middle line:90%
it becomes totally fascinating.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Dee thought that math was the
language that God uses to talk.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:34.131 align:middle line:90%
It was that simple.

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:35.463 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's not the only one.

00:19:35.463 --> 00:19:36.900 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people think this now.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yeah.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And he basically-- again, with
the backdrop of religious wars,

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.320 align:middle line:84%
people fighting
over who's right,

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Dee wanted to figure out,
well, what's the truth?

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And the conclusion that he came
to, which I think is completely

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.810 align:middle line:84%
accurate, is that-- and
I think more scientists

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:52.520 align:middle line:84%
and mathematicians
would agree with it--

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.521 align:middle line:84%
is that if we really want
to understand reality,

00:19:54.521 --> 00:19:56.061 align:middle line:84%
if we want to
understand what's true,

00:19:56.061 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:84%
you have to go to
pure mathematics

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.480 align:middle line:90%
because you can't fake it.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.650 align:middle line:90%
The numbers don't lie.

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:01.520 align:middle line:90%
Statistics might.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.010 align:middle line:90%
But pure mathematics don't.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So he thought
that-- for instance,

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.000 align:middle line:84%
that the fact that there are
mathematical constants that

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.880 align:middle line:84%
repeat throughout nature,
like pi, phi, and e, and all

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.334 align:middle line:84%
these things, the Fibonacci
sequence-- the fact

00:20:13.334 --> 00:20:14.750 align:middle line:84%
that there are
repeating sequences

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:19.650 align:middle line:84%
shows that there's some type of
inherent structure to reality.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you can't deny that.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.890 align:middle line:84%
So he wrote the introduction to
a book called the "Elements,"

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:29.500 align:middle line:84%
by Euclid, which was the
first big textbook on higher

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.830 align:middle line:84%
mathematics that was brought to
the public, in which he says,

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:84%
that mathematics is not just
a way of counting dollars

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:84%
or pounds at the
time in England.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a way of--

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Quid.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.570 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of
understanding reality.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's a way of
talking to God.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And he actually
says in that book--

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.950 align:middle line:84%
it's so crazy-- he says that we
may have come to a time period

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.230 align:middle line:84%
where there is no longer
any big revelations.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.260 align:middle line:84%
All the big revelations came to
the desert prophets long ago.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.951 align:middle line:84%
But even if we can't get divine
revelations, we have math.

00:21:01.951 --> 00:21:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's just
as good because it's

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.552 align:middle line:84%
a way of understanding
what reality actually is.

00:21:06.552 --> 00:21:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And again, I mean, I think it's
an out there way to put it.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:10.926 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
mathematicians or scientists

00:21:10.926 --> 00:21:12.520 align:middle line:90%
would argue against that.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.650 align:middle line:84%
It's just said in a
slightly different language.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.274 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
would agree with you.

00:21:16.274 --> 00:21:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that was also part
of his love of astrology,

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:22.210 align:middle line:84%
the pure mathematical
movement of the cosmos

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and its interface
with the Earth.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Mm-hmm.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Math again.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Also his work was influenced
by Hermes and the "Corpus

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:32.639 align:middle line:90%
Hermeticum."

00:21:32.639 --> 00:21:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can talk
about that a little bit.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yeah.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So the hermetic texts are kind
of an underground tradition

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.780 align:middle line:84%
of literature,
that's been around

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.610 align:middle line:84%
since the death of Christ
and before that even.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:44.410 align:middle line:90%
There were--

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Probably way before.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yeah.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a crazy field.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:50.815 align:middle line:84%
There is a hermetic text from
Egypt, from the Coptics, from--

00:21:50.815 --> 00:21:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the Egyptians
said from Atlantis.

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:55.570 align:middle line:84%
That's down from there, to the
Egyptians, to the Coptics--

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:56.370 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:57.120 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Right.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's an interesting
literary genre.

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's a literary genre
where there are claims

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.082 align:middle line:90%
like that made, Atlantis.

00:22:05.082 --> 00:22:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And then there also
claims where-- it was

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:08.336 align:middle line:90%
written by Hermes Trismegistus.

00:22:08.336 --> 00:22:10.960 align:middle line:84%
This turns out to be a pen name,
that a lot of different people

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.760 align:middle line:90%
shared.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.260 align:middle line:84%
There was probably never
one Hermes Trismegistus.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's a genre
of literature that

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.960 align:middle line:84%
looks at reality in the way that
I've been saying, as if it's

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.470 align:middle line:84%
one thing, one substance, and
can be understood directly,

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.260 align:middle line:84%
without a intermediary
of a church.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.630 align:middle line:90%
And that's a dangerous idea.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:31.690 align:middle line:84%
It was a dangerous idea then,
that you could understand

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.940 align:middle line:84%
reality through experiment
and direct revelation,

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:84%
instead of a church hierarchy
telling you what to believe.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I love about it.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.484 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: It's dangerous now.

00:22:38.484 --> 00:22:39.880 align:middle line:90%
That's a really dangerous idea.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Love it.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:42.179 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: That's really
what the Hermetica--

00:22:42.179 --> 00:22:44.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's an incredibly
complex literary genre.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:44.860 align:middle line:90%
But that's--

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:44.935 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:22:44.935 --> 00:22:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: --what it comes down to.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.654 align:middle line:84%
So he was influenced by
that because that was

00:22:48.654 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:90%
his own approach, essentially.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Absolutely.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.000 align:middle line:84%
It formed the intellectual
underpinnings, not just of

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.820 align:middle line:84%
his approach, but of the
people who-- the Rosicrucians,

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.550 align:middle line:84%
the people who became
the scientists.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.580 align:middle line:84%
If you think of it
this time, there's

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.890 align:middle line:84%
two big competing schools
of thought, the Catholics

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.180 align:middle line:90%
and Protestants.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And they're at war, these giant
titans fighting each other.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And in between, there was this
little third option, which

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.160 align:middle line:90%
is the hermetics, who are--

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the Rosicrucians.

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Right.

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, why don't we just
actually do an experiment

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.221 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what reality
is instead of fighting

00:23:17.221 --> 00:23:18.670 align:middle line:90%
over what we think it is.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:22.642 align:middle line:84%
And it was that underground
that became modern science.

00:23:22.642 --> 00:23:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he
wrote, ultimately,

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.220 align:middle line:90%
the "Monas Hieroglyphica?"

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yes.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And tell us what that
is and what its influence was.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: So the
"Monas Hieroglyphica"

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.920 align:middle line:90%
was a short text.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.040 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe 10 pages
long, 15 pages long.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.740 align:middle line:10%
And it's a book that's
synthesized everything

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:10%
that he knew about the
hermetics, alchemy, astrology,

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:46.010 align:middle line:10%
science, mathematics
into one text,

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.950 align:middle line:10%
that he said has the
key to the mysteries

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:50.020 align:middle line:10%
and explains all of reality.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And also explains
the key to alchemy,

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:55.430 align:middle line:84%
which is what all the monarchs
in Europe wanted at this time.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And so he brought this
to several monarchs,

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.710 align:middle line:84%
including the Holy Roman
Emperor Maximilian I.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.180 align:middle line:90%
He brought it to Elizabeth.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.092 align:middle line:84%
And he told them, this book
has all the secrets of alchemy.

00:24:04.092 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, so you mean
you can make us as much gold

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:07.450 align:middle line:90%
as we want.

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Always they
go to the lowest place.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: He said, well, no,
but I can enlighten you.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.995 align:middle line:84%
It'll bring you
spiritual wisdom.

00:24:12.995 --> 00:24:16.465 align:middle line:84%
And their response was, OK,
next, next, next, please.

00:24:16.465 --> 00:24:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, exactly.

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:22.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, so how did he get into the
good graces of Queen Elizabeth

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and become such a
valued advisor to her?

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And what was the nature of the
kind of advice he would render?

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: It's a
fascinating story.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So he was a loyalist to
Elizabeth during Mary's reign.

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And was brought in basically
as a security guard,

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:41.200 align:middle line:84%
as a magical security
guard to Elizabeth's court.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.440 align:middle line:84%
As soon as she seized
power, the outgoing regime

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:49.205 align:middle line:84%
was employing all these
Catholic sorcerers, in a sense.

00:24:49.205 --> 00:24:50.830 align:middle line:84%
They were sticking--
it's a real story.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:51.954 align:middle line:90%
They were sticking voodoo--

00:24:51.954 --> 00:24:53.590 align:middle line:84%
making voodoo doll
of her, sticking--

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:58.360 align:middle line:84%
all this crazy stuff, creating
propaganda campaigns to make

00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.590 align:middle line:90%
her look bad.

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Doing all kinds of crazy
magical things, to try

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.370 align:middle line:90%
and take down her court.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And so Dee was brought in
to counteract this and be

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.940 align:middle line:90%
their kind of magical advisor.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:84%
But he also became the
scientific advisor.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.600 align:middle line:84%
He became the
mathematical advisor.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the people who
is instrumental in setting up

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.660 align:middle line:84%
the British security services,
which later became MI5 and MI6,

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:21.826 align:middle line:90%
with Sir Francis Walsingham.

00:25:21.826 --> 00:25:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, we'll
talk about too.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Elizabeth
referred to him as 007.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.010 align:middle line:84%
That's the code number
which became James Bond.

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Ian Fleming was
tapped into this knowledge.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yes.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.090 align:middle line:90%
Ian Fleming was a fascinating--

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:84%
of course, the
author of James Bond,

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.180 align:middle line:90%
who was a fascinating guy.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:41.310 align:middle line:84%
He was employed by, I believe,
MI6 or MI5 during World War II,

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:44.170 align:middle line:84%
to create propaganda campaigns
to throw off the Nazi war

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:44.970 align:middle line:90%
effort.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:49.230 align:middle line:84%
As part of this, he
employed Alister Crowley

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:54.400 align:middle line:84%
to falsify astrological
charts for Rudolf Hess,

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.340 align:middle line:84%
so that he would be
confused-- it's so strange.

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.860 align:middle line:90%
So he would do wrong--

00:25:58.860 --> 00:25:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bad decisions.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Bad decisions, right.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.480 align:middle line:90%
They never implemented the plan.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.120 align:middle line:84%
But Fleming was so taken with
this world of the occult that

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.510 align:middle line:84%
when he created James Bond,
he named his creation 007.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And he also patterned Blofeld,
who's the head of Spectre,

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.500 align:middle line:84%
off Crowley, the
ultimate bad guy.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:16.480 align:middle line:90%
It is fascinating.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.938 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: The one
with the white cat.

00:26:17.938 --> 00:26:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.280 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.488 align:middle line:90%
You can't make this stuff up.

00:26:21.488 --> 00:26:22.740 align:middle line:90%
It has to be born somewhere.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And apparently it
goes back to John Dee.

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:29.790 align:middle line:84%
So John Dee, how did he
influence the development

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:32.910 align:middle line:90%
of the field of intelligence?

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:35.484 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: So during
this time, they were--

00:26:35.484 --> 00:26:36.900 align:middle line:84%
England, you have
to remember, was

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.930 align:middle line:84%
a tiny, impoverished
country, that

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.750 align:middle line:90%
was at the point of the stick--

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.970 align:middle line:84%
at the point of a stick
of the Catholic block.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.980 align:middle line:84%
All of Europe was Catholic,
outside of England

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.300 align:middle line:90%
and the Netherlands.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.626 align:middle line:84%
And they were at
extreme disadvantage.

00:26:51.626 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:90%
People were starving.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.430 align:middle line:84%
They had very few
material resources.

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So Elizabeth was
doing everything

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.000 align:middle line:84%
she could to keep
her country going

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.070 align:middle line:90%
and make sure that it survived.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And during this time, they did
set up the British intelligence

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.840 align:middle line:90%
services to counteract--

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.960 align:middle line:84%
you know, as part
of the war effort.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And Dee's job during
this-- it was set up

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.190 align:middle line:90%
by Francis Walsingham.

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And as an aside, by the way,
just for some more context,

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.170 align:middle line:84%
England was so
poor at this time,

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.870 align:middle line:84%
people often accused
Dee of dying of poverty.

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, how he couldn't
have been such a good magician.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.320 align:middle line:84%
The reality was that everyone
was poor at this time.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Francis Walsingham, who started
the intelligence services,

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:32.550 align:middle line:84%
financed it out
of his own pocket

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.675 align:middle line:84%
because he couldn't get
paid by Elizabeth to do it.

00:27:34.675 --> 00:27:36.510 align:middle line:84%
That's how strapped
the government was.

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:40.830 align:middle line:10%
So Dee's role in this
was getting information.

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.540 align:middle line:10%
They were very
interested in collecting

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.220 align:middle line:10%
all of the occult information
that was available in Europe.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.700 align:middle line:84%
He was sent to discover
this book called

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.130 align:middle line:84%
the "Steganographia," to hunt
for it throughout Europe.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:55.050 align:middle line:84%
It was a grimoire that
promised to not only have

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:58.800 align:middle line:84%
the secret of cryptography,
but also to contain

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.990 align:middle line:84%
a magical ritual that
would allow somebody

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:03.090 align:middle line:84%
to spy on somebody
else in the country,

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.580 align:middle line:84%
to call up a vision of
what someone was doing.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.954 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's what
I was going to bring up next.

00:28:07.954 --> 00:28:09.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were
doing real spying,

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.072 align:middle line:84%
real remote viewing,
so to speak.

00:28:11.072 --> 00:28:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Remote viewing.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Basically that's what
they were trying to figure out.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which makes
sense, because if you

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.420 align:middle line:84%
don't have any resources, you
can't necessarily send people

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:21.630 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, get them
on a train, or a donkey,

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:24.280 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, to get where they
need to go to do the research.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.740 align:middle line:90%
So you just go direct, right?

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Right.

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so did he have
some success, as far as you

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.310 align:middle line:84%
can tell, by way of
training other agents

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.140 align:middle line:90%
or being able to view?

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: As far as I
know, he never actually

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:37.690 align:middle line:90%
directly engaged in it.

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:40.115 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: They sent
him to find the book.

00:28:40.115 --> 00:28:42.090 align:middle line:84%
What he did do is he
took the techniques

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and then applied them
to his later work,

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:46.980 align:middle line:84%
scrying angels and
talking to angels.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.680 align:middle line:84%
That went into his work,
tried to basically remote view

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.720 align:middle line:84%
angels, if you want to
put it in those terms.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, so it's not surprising that
John Dee had some detractors

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:56.640 align:middle line:90%
and even enemies.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Who were John Prestall
and Vincent Murphyn?

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And why did they try
to take him down?

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yes.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:05.542 align:middle line:84%
So these two gentlemen were
two very shady characters.

00:29:05.542 --> 00:29:06.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gentlemen.

00:29:06.375 --> 00:29:06.690 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yes.

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:12.855 align:middle line:84%
They were fake
alchemists and sorcerers.

00:29:12.855 --> 00:29:13.980 align:middle line:90%
There is a real difference.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.688 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's really
important to make

00:29:15.688 --> 00:29:18.025 align:middle line:84%
this distinction because
it's important now also.

00:29:18.025 --> 00:29:19.650 align:middle line:84%
There is a real
difference between what

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.890 align:middle line:84%
we might, by way of
oversimplification,

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:24.750 align:middle line:90%
call high magic and low magic.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:27.750 align:middle line:84%
High magic is totally
about understanding

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:28.840 align:middle line:90%
God in the universe.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:29.886 align:middle line:90%
And it's like science.

00:29:29.886 --> 00:29:31.260 align:middle line:84%
It's about becoming
spiritually--

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sensing the
nature of reality.

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Absolutely.

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And trying to become
more enlightened

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:35.940 align:middle line:90%
and a better person.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:36.930 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:38.250 align:middle line:90%
That's high magic.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And low magic is trying to
use magic to get your way,

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.510 align:middle line:90%
or hurt somebody, or get money.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Have power.

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Totally.

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:50.247 align:middle line:84%
It's all these
very vulgar things,

00:29:50.247 --> 00:29:52.080 align:middle line:84%
that anyone who was
interested in high magic

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.970 align:middle line:84%
would just not be
interested in at all

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:56.130 align:middle line:90%
and be allergic to, essentially.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.800 align:middle line:84%
But there are lots of people
who are interested in it.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.190 align:middle line:90%
And there were at the time.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And these two gentlemen,
Murphyn and Prestall,

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:08.010 align:middle line:84%
were employed by the
outgoing Catholic regime,

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:09.660 align:middle line:84%
and also during
Queen Mary's reign,

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:13.900 align:middle line:84%
if I remember correctly, to
attack Elizabeth and Dee using

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:14.700 align:middle line:90%
magic.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.040 align:middle line:90%
And they fought dirty.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.590 align:middle line:84%
They used occult means,
like voodoo dolls and things

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.570 align:middle line:84%
like that, to try
and attack them.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:24.550 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing
that they did was

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:26.890 align:middle line:84%
try to slander their
public reputations,

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.890 align:middle line:84%
by creating propaganda
to say that Dee

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:31.900 align:middle line:84%
was a black magician
and a sorcerer

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and Elizabeth was part of--
the Antichrist and all of this.

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:39.280 align:middle line:90%
And that a woman--

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.794 align:middle line:84%
or Elizabeth, a woman, and
specifically Elizabeth,

00:30:41.794 --> 00:30:43.210 align:middle line:84%
being on the throne
of England was

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:44.560 align:middle line:90%
a sign of the end of the world.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And they really
wanted to stir up

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:52.750 align:middle line:84%
the public against the
current ruling powers.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So it was an ongoing,
kind of gutter level war

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.519 align:middle line:84%
that those two guys waged
against Dee and Elizabeth.

00:30:59.519 --> 00:31:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's one that
frankly Dee was not

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.040 align:middle line:84%
particularly prepared
for because he

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.180 align:middle line:90%
was an innocent in a way.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.720 align:middle line:84%
He was a pure and very noble
seeker after knowledge.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And he just was not prepared
for people to fight that dirty.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.370 align:middle line:84%
So he suffered from
their propaganda attacks.

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.770 align:middle line:84%
His reputation
suffers to this day,

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:19.450 align:middle line:84%
not just from their
propaganda attacks,

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:24.700 align:middle line:84%
but by many other people,
including James I's regime,

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.890 align:middle line:84%
which came in after
Elizabeth decided to sweep

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:30.100 align:middle line:90%
all magic under the carpet.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And so Dee's reputation
has been sullied.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.080 align:middle line:84%
He was been called a black
magician and a sorcerer

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.660 align:middle line:84%
when he was the
complete opposite.

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that I've
tried to repair with this.

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, clearly.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing a
beautiful job of it.

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Thank you.

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
and too, in that day,

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.040 align:middle line:90%
there was no defense against it.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean there was
no, like, litigation

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.912 align:middle line:90%
over slander in the day.

00:31:48.912 --> 00:31:50.120 align:middle line:90%
You just had to live with it.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.495 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Go against
the dark arts.

00:31:51.495 --> 00:31:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There was none.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:55.450 align:middle line:10%
And so I think
when we're talking

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:57.080 align:middle line:10%
about these kind of
nuanced characters,

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.110 align:middle line:10%
this is a good time
to bring in Edward

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:02.590 align:middle line:10%
Kelley and his association
with Edward Kelley

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.280 align:middle line:10%
and what they produced together.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yes.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because,
again, Edward was

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:10.630 align:middle line:90%
a mixed bag of human traits.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to say
this too, a lot of people

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.210 align:middle line:84%
really enjoyed the
work in the 1960s,

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:19.170 align:middle line:90%
'70s, of Ruth Montgomery.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And her association and
her channeled source

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.930 align:middle line:90%
was Arthur Ford.

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Arthur Ford, who had a major
problem with alcohol and such,

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.300 align:middle line:84%
even when he was a
medium in his day.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And I bring this
up because there

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.850 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of, if you look at
it from a metaphysical point

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:36.700 align:middle line:84%
of view, a type of
porosity that happens

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.630 align:middle line:84%
within the auric
field, so to speak,

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:43.030 align:middle line:84%
of people who have addictions,
that allows for a permeability,

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:46.300 align:middle line:84%
that really other
beings can see through,

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.580 align:middle line:84%
come in through very
easily compared to someone

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.320 align:middle line:90%
who is super-healthy.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.120 align:middle line:90%
And they're in their zone.

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a different deal.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.106 align:middle line:90%
That's not so permeable.

00:32:54.106 --> 00:32:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And I bring it up
because I think

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.688 align:middle line:90%
it's important to understand.

00:32:56.688 --> 00:33:00.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why so many psychics,
even the best of them,

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:03.135 align:middle line:84%
are often very flawed on
a deeply personal level.

00:33:03.135 --> 00:33:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So here we go with
Edward Kelley.

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:06.051 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: That's a
fascinating-- that's

00:33:06.051 --> 00:33:07.250 align:middle line:90%
a very interesting point.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:09.900 align:middle line:84%
I also think that having known
a lot of psychics and mediums,

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I think that a lot of
psychics and mediums

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:16.625 align:middle line:84%
also struggle with being
that open and empathic.

00:33:16.625 --> 00:33:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: They also struggle
with being judged by society.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:22.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's not an easy life.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: And so that's
something that we need to--

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and I've known a lot
of psychics and mediums

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.880 align:middle line:90%
with substance abuse issues.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: And so it's
not so black and white.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
black and white at all.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.090 align:middle line:84%
So I just bring
that up so we can

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:37.310 align:middle line:84%
set the stage for yet another
nuanced colorful character--

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yes.

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA:
--counterfeiter and all.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Absolutely.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:44.680 align:middle line:84%
So Dee is what we refer
to as a hard head.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.312 align:middle line:90%
So he was, as I probably--

00:33:47.312 --> 00:33:49.770 align:middle line:84%
you probably get a sense of
him from what I've been saying.

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: He was
very intellectual.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.080 align:middle line:90%
He was very academic.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.790 align:middle line:84%
He was on the payroll
of the government.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:57.160 align:middle line:90%
He was hyperrational.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And so he did not have
any innate psychic talent.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.150 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't open.

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:02.210 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't empathic.

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:04.970 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have an artistic
way of viewing the world.

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And so even though he was
fascinated with the theory

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:10.060 align:middle line:90%
of magic and he spent--

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.949 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to
the age of 50, he

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:14.080 align:middle line:84%
spent all of his time
studying all the theory,

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.000 align:middle line:84%
and the text, and
the academic side,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.980 align:middle line:84%
and all the little
bits and pieces.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:22.389 align:middle line:84%
But he, himself, his attempts
to actually make magic work

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:26.500 align:middle line:84%
were not successful because
he couldn't go into a trance

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.570 align:middle line:90%
and go into altered states.

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And so what that meant was
he had to employ people

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:33.130 align:middle line:90%
to do it with him.

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:34.929 align:middle line:90%
He had to employ psychics.

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:37.510 align:middle line:84%
So that he would basically
do a magical ritual to,

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.610 align:middle line:90%
let's say, talk to an angel.

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:42.219 align:middle line:84%
And then the psychic would
have the vision of the angel,

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:43.330 align:middle line:90%
instead of him.

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And he would write down
what the psychic saw.

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's a working partnership
that's very common in magic.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: They do it all the time.

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:51.673 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Edgar Casey, and his
wife, and a lot of people, yes.

00:34:51.673 --> 00:34:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: OK.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So Dee had auditioned
several scryers.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.050 align:middle line:84%
A scryer is a type
of psychic that

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:01.450 align:middle line:84%
uses a piece of crystal
or a crystal ball

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:04.000 align:middle line:84%
as a focus to go
into a trance state.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And he had auditioned
several of them--

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.310 align:middle line:84%
it was a very common role
in England at this time--

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:11.627 align:middle line:90%
to kind of middling success.

00:35:11.627 --> 00:35:13.960 align:middle line:84%
But that changed when he met
this fascinating character,

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Edward Kelley, who was
found for him by a talent

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.900 align:middle line:84%
scout for psychics that
the crown had appointed.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Interesting job titles, it
was the Elizabethan age.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And Edward Kelley, he brings
a long shadow with him.

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:30.845 align:middle line:84%
He was half Dee's
age when they met.

00:35:30.845 --> 00:35:37.360 align:middle line:84%
So he was 25 or 26, very
overweight, an alcoholic.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.620 align:middle line:84%
He had his ears cut off for
being caught forging coins.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.590 align:middle line:84%
He had been accused of
necromancy and summoning

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.400 align:middle line:84%
corpses out of graves, some of
which is probably exaggerated.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.270 align:middle line:90%
And some of which may be true.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.000 align:middle line:90%
And he kind of--

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Dee's writes in his diary that
the day that Kelley showed up

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:55.080 align:middle line:84%
at Mortlake, which
was Dee's household,

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.190 align:middle line:90%
the moon turned blood red.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:59.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like a hammer horror
movie or something.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:04.350 align:middle line:84%
But despite his air of
disrespectability and being

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:06.930 align:middle line:84%
from the wrong side of the
tracks, he could do it.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:08.080 align:middle line:90%
He had real psychic--

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talent.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: --talent, or
whatever it is, ability

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.860 align:middle line:84%
to go into trances or
just creative imagination,

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.870 align:middle line:90%
whatever it happened to be.

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And Dee was so impressed
with his abilities

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.390 align:middle line:84%
that he put him on payroll
for the next seven years

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:24.690 align:middle line:84%
and had him do
essentially channeling

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:27.060 align:middle line:84%
or psychic mediumship,
three times a day,

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.820 align:middle line:84%
for the next seven years, which
was very, very hard on Kelley

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.122 align:middle line:90%
and really wore him down.

00:36:31.122 --> 00:36:32.580 align:middle line:84%
It's also possible
that he may have

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:36.030 align:middle line:84%
been using some type of
substance to facilitate that.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And keeping that type
of schedule, using--

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:40.500 align:middle line:84%
for that long a period,
using whatever substance

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.070 align:middle line:84%
it happened to be,
whatever it was,

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:46.310 align:middle line:84%
can certainly have
a toll on somebody.

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:48.580 align:middle line:90%
So he was very erratic.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.880 align:middle line:84%
He had his ups and downs
while in Dee's employ.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.430 align:middle line:84%
They formed a incredible
working partnership.

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And they generated over a
thousand pages of records,

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.770 align:middle line:84%
of scrying angels, and speaking
to various spiritual beings,

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:00.480 align:middle line:84%
which are beautiful
and profound,

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and on par or
greater in language

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.900 align:middle line:84%
than perhaps even the King
James Bible, parts of them.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And incredible, even just
as a literary record.

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:15.240 align:middle line:84%
But there were certainly parts
where Kelley became unhinged.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was a tumultuous
working relationship,

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:20.640 align:middle line:84%
but a fascinating
one at a human level

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.680 align:middle line:84%
between two very
different individuals, who

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.175 align:middle line:90%
formed a greater whole.

00:37:24.175 --> 00:37:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
why I brought up

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:29.460 align:middle line:84%
the difficulty of being
open to other forces.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Because at the same time, kind
of monstrous types of entities

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:36.630 align:middle line:84%
started manifesting for
Dee and such as well.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:40.080 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like these were
kind of angelic things, kind

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:43.800 align:middle line:84%
of mixed in with the hodgepodge
of some lower realm creatures.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: So as the sessions
went on, at the beginning

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:49.090 align:middle line:90%
of the sessions, what--

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:51.540 align:middle line:84%
so first of all, the
point of the sessions

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.914 align:middle line:90%
was for Dee to talk to angels.

00:37:52.914 --> 00:37:53.830 align:middle line:90%
That's what he wanted.

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:55.680 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to communicate
with angels because, you

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.180 align:middle line:84%
have to remember,
this is perhaps

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.150 align:middle line:90%
the smartest person of his age.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.260 align:middle line:90%
He'd been all over Europe.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.480 align:middle line:84%
He'd studied under all the
great intellectual masters

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.160 align:middle line:90%
of the European universities.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.920 align:middle line:84%
He was smarter,
basically, probably

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.310 align:middle line:90%
than anyone in England.

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:11.760 align:middle line:84%
He had five times the books
of Oxford and Cambridge,

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.160 align:middle line:84%
each of which had maybe
400, 500 books each.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.862 align:middle line:84%
He had 2,500 books, maybe
4,000 at one point at Mortlake,

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:19.320 align:middle line:84%
which is probably
why he was always

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.640 align:middle line:84%
broke because he's spending
all his money on books--

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On books.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: --which some of
us can empathize with.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:26.430 align:middle line:84%
But he got to a point
where he realized

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.980 align:middle line:84%
if he wanted to know anything
more, he was going to have to,

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.930 align:middle line:84%
in his mind, speak to
higher authorities.

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:33.430 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't learn anything
more from human beings.

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And so his goal was
to speak to the angels

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.820 align:middle line:84%
and make contact with them, to
recover the original knowledge

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:39.750 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:40.710 align:middle line:90%
That was his goal.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:44.400 align:middle line:84%
It was totally pure,
totally spiritual.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.890 align:middle line:84%
But he became involved with
these different scryers

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:49.020 align:middle line:90%
in order to do that.

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the sessions, which
lasted about seven years,

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:53.680 align:middle line:90%
it was a real process.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.300 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't cut and dry.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:39:00.120 align:middle line:84%
What was happening was Dee and
Kelley were being tuned up.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.130 align:middle line:84%
The view of the angels,
when they manifested,

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:04.980 align:middle line:84%
was we're going to
give you knowledge.

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:07.080 align:middle line:84%
But before you're
worthy to receive it,

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.430 align:middle line:90%
you have to be purified.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:10.380 align:middle line:90%
You have to be humbled.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.340 align:middle line:90%
You have to be--

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:14.070 align:middle line:84%
all the defilements
of your souls

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:16.950 align:middle line:90%
must be filed off or removed.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't just
receive higher knowledge.

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:21.570 align:middle line:90%
You have to be prepared.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Even the Bible says this, right.

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So many years went by,
where Dee and Kelley

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.350 align:middle line:84%
were being tested, purified,
put through various intense

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:34.770 align:middle line:84%
situations that brought
them always to greater

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:90%
levels of faith and humility.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning,
they were being confronted

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.824 align:middle line:90%
by many demonic appearances.

00:39:44.824 --> 00:39:46.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they couldn't
yet tell the difference

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.060 align:middle line:90%
between demons and angels.

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:49.860 align:middle line:90%
But the angels showed them how.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
original sessions

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:55.590 align:middle line:84%
were, in a sense, an exorcism,
where the angels were kicking

00:39:55.590 --> 00:40:00.660 align:middle line:84%
out all the lower forces
that they saw attached to,

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:03.600 align:middle line:84%
not just Dee and Kelley,
but all humanity.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And Kelley himself
had spent a lot

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:10.650 align:middle line:84%
of time doing demonic types
of magic for personal gain.

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:12.480 align:middle line:90%
And they picked up on that.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And so most of
the early sessions

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:17.220 align:middle line:84%
were the angels kind of pushing
Kelley around and trying

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.510 align:middle line:84%
to get him shaped up, so
that he was spiritually pure

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.014 align:middle line:90%
enough to receive higher wisdom.

00:40:22.014 --> 00:40:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And they have their
work cut out for him

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.560 align:middle line:84%
because he was a
rough character.

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.930 align:middle line:84%
But as the sessions
went on, once they

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:32.410 align:middle line:84%
got through that period, then
it became almost purely angelic.

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what was
the direction and nature

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:38.230 align:middle line:90%
of the body of work, in summary?

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I do want to
get into the end times

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.480 align:middle line:84%
scenario, the mission to
save the 144,000 souls,

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.950 align:middle line:90%
and who those actually were.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So we'll lead from one
question to the next.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Right.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.310 align:middle line:84%
So when the angels
appeared, which

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:57.760 align:middle line:84%
was pretty quickly
after Kelley showed up,

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.676 align:middle line:84%
the first thing that they did,
after putting Dee and Kelley

00:41:00.676 --> 00:41:02.050 align:middle line:84%
through their
paces, is give them

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:05.440 align:middle line:84%
a system for making deeper
contact, which is now referred

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.112 align:middle line:84%
to as Enochian
magic, which is not

00:41:07.112 --> 00:41:08.320 align:middle line:90%
a term they used at the time.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.877 align:middle line:90%
It's a term later writers used.

00:41:10.877 --> 00:41:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And the Enochian
system, and language,

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:15.970 align:middle line:84%
which was supposed to be the
language that the angels spoke

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:19.540 align:middle line:84%
before the fall
of-- from Eden, was

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.880 align:middle line:84%
to tune them up and
allow them deeper access

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.010 align:middle line:90%
to the angelic realms.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Once they got through
that, the angels

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:28.000 align:middle line:84%
made their agenda
pretty clear, which

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.180 align:middle line:84%
is not different at all from
really what is in the Bible.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.970 align:middle line:84%
It was that humanity
needs to be redeemed.

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:35.872 align:middle line:84%
They were not pleased
with the Reformation.

00:41:35.872 --> 00:41:38.080 align:middle line:84%
They weren't pleased with
the Catholic Church either.

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.663 align:middle line:84%
They thought that
humanity had entered

00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:42.700 align:middle line:84%
a very debased and violent
period of history, had fallen

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.670 align:middle line:84%
very far from the
original teachings that

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:48.470 align:middle line:84%
are either from the Old
Testament or from Christ.

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:50.210 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to argue with.

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
directly use Dee and Kelley

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:57.490 align:middle line:84%
as agents to advance their
vision for the world, which

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:00.500 align:middle line:84%
is kind of intense,
or very intense.

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:03.370 align:middle line:84%
What the angels wanted
was-- their view was,

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:06.700 align:middle line:84%
humans have had their
chance to get it right.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:07.840 align:middle line:90%
They haven't got it right.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.210 align:middle line:84%
We would like to
take the wheel now,

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:13.610 align:middle line:84%
in order to-- what we
want is a new religion.

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:16.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a new, hermetic-based
super-religion,

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:21.070 align:middle line:84%
combining Catholicism,
Protestantism, Judaism, Islam,

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:21.880 align:middle line:90%
paganism even.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.296 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And very
hermetic, yeah.

00:42:23.296 --> 00:42:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Very hermetic.

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:26.500 align:middle line:84%
One universal religion
of love, which

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.630 align:middle line:84%
will be ministered by
the angels directly.

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:32.560 align:middle line:84%
They wanted humans to have a
way to contact the divine realms

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.540 align:middle line:84%
one on one, instead
of having to deal

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:35.729 align:middle line:90%
with a corrupt institution.

00:42:35.729 --> 00:42:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Although they also
thought the people

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:40.010 align:middle line:84%
should still be attached
to the body of the Church,

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:42.700 align:middle line:84%
because it was an
important tool.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And communion was important,
and all of these things.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:51.100 align:middle line:84%
But they wanted almost
to directly redeem

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.630 align:middle line:84%
humanity, almost
in spite of itself,

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:55.250 align:middle line:84%
which hasn't worked
out very well.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:57.860 align:middle line:84%
They wanted a kind
of global conversion.

00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yes.

00:42:58.660 --> 00:42:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.446 align:middle line:84%
So they had their
work cut out for them,

00:43:01.446 --> 00:43:03.750 align:middle line:84%
proselytizing and
trying to get buy-ins

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.710 align:middle line:84%
in other countries,
leadership, churches,

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:08.585 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, not easy.

00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Their original plan
was they wanted-- in addition

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:14.020 align:middle line:84%
to this, they wanted one
world empire, under Elizabeth

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.180 align:middle line:84%
as the sovereign,
which Dee already

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.615 align:middle line:90%
laid the groundwork for.

00:43:18.615 --> 00:43:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So when you step
back and you see

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:22.270 align:middle line:84%
that Dee is responsible
not only for creating

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:24.830 align:middle line:84%
the British empire, which
ruled most of the planet,

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:27.607 align:middle line:84%
but also potentially--
the plan was

00:43:27.607 --> 00:43:29.440 align:middle line:84%
to create one religion
that ruled everybody.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.550 align:middle line:90%
That's a big plan.

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:32.762 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:32.762 --> 00:43:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: In a way,
it has come true.

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:36.886 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that the British
empire, if you really step back

00:43:36.886 --> 00:43:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and you look at
the British empire,

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:40.272 align:middle line:84%
or in some ways the
American empire,

00:43:40.272 --> 00:43:41.980 align:middle line:84%
you can definitely
see that parts of that

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:44.727 align:middle line:90%
have perhaps influenced people.

00:43:44.727 --> 00:43:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:47.417 align:middle line:90%
Let's get into--

00:43:47.417 --> 00:43:49.000 align:middle line:84%
I think we can just
kind of skip over.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.760 align:middle line:84%
There's one part I wanted to
get into, about Kelley's life.

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Because of the lack of
funding and the constant need

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:58.960 align:middle line:84%
for patronage, he tended to
flip allegiances, to work for,

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.810 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Protestant,
Catholic, or whatnot, kind

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:02.980 align:middle line:90%
of anybody.

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:04.750 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, so that
he could get the funds

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:06.250 align:middle line:90%
needed to do his real work.

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yeah.

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And the crazy thing is the
angels encouraged him in that.

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:12.586 align:middle line:84%
They kind of said, look,
you're working for us now.

00:44:12.586 --> 00:44:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
direct connection.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.397 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry too much about--

00:44:15.397 --> 00:44:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This petty
politics of the planet.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yeah.

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:18.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were helpful
in steering him.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.354 align:middle line:84%
There were many times
that the Catholic Church--

00:44:24.354 --> 00:44:26.770 align:middle line:84%
the Jesuits probably would
have killed him multiple times.

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:29.103 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to bring Dee
and Kelley to the Vatican,

00:44:29.103 --> 00:44:31.930 align:middle line:84%
where they probably would
have been tortured and killed

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:33.220 align:middle line:90%
for heresy.

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:37.235 align:middle line:84%
And there are many times where
they narrowly avoided disaster.

00:44:37.235 --> 00:44:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
probably looked after.

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yeah.

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:40.650 align:middle line:90%
It's all there in the records.

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: It's crazy.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into the
144,000, the end times

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:50.770 align:middle line:84%
scenario, 12 tribes of Israel,
new world order, all of that.

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And then start getting
into the implications

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.450 align:middle line:84%
of how that carried
down through history

00:44:55.450 --> 00:44:57.160 align:middle line:84%
and how it's still
playing out today

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.720 align:middle line:84%
because this is really the
crux of it in a lot of ways

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: A good question.

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:01.970 align:middle line:90%
And we have time.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: OK.

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big answers are good.

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: So basically
what the angels

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:10.780 align:middle line:84%
said is, humanity should
be directly redeemed.

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And what they
thought is the events

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:17.240 align:middle line:84%
of the Book of Revelation
need to be reenacted.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:22.582 align:middle line:84%
And the angels, they wanted a
salvation plan for humanity.

00:45:22.582 --> 00:45:24.790 align:middle line:84%
They thought that it was
already the end of the world

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:28.570 align:middle line:84%
and humanity was laboring under
the reign of the Antichrist.

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Which, it's interesting to think
about because we often look

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:33.787 align:middle line:90%
at these things as literal.

00:45:33.787 --> 00:45:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Like somebody is always coming
out saying the end of the world

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:37.940 align:middle line:90%
is next Thursday.

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:41.330 align:middle line:84%
But if you really
step back again.

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think that divine events,
whatever, these things probably

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:47.290 align:middle line:84%
play out on long
timelines, even if you just

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:50.410 align:middle line:90%
look at them as metaphorical.

00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:54.800 align:middle line:84%
The Elizabethan era was, what,
400 years ago, 500 years ago.

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.800 align:middle line:84%
If you think about how
much things have crumbled

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.050 align:middle line:84%
since then, the degradation
of the environment,

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:00.750 align:middle line:84%
the pollution of
the planet, it's

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:02.833 align:middle line:84%
hard to argue that things
aren't at least a little

00:46:02.833 --> 00:46:03.880 align:middle line:90%
bit apocalyptic.

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So Dee was convinced that the
angels meant-- the angels told

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:08.890 align:middle line:90%
him the world would end in '88.

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:11.050 align:middle line:90%
And he thought this meant 1588.

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:14.407 align:middle line:84%
But it seems they
meant something else.

00:46:14.407 --> 00:46:16.240 align:middle line:84%
They never said it would
be a specific date.

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:19.360 align:middle line:84%
It seems that for
beings like that,

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.590 align:middle line:84%
they probably see on
very long time-frames.

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:28.210 align:middle line:84%
But what they wanted
was to prepare the way

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:30.550 align:middle line:90%
for the salvation of humanity.

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And their way of doing
that was this idea

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:35.255 align:middle line:90%
of a new religion and a new--

00:46:35.255 --> 00:46:37.130 align:middle line:84%
the spread of Christianity
around the planet,

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:39.776 align:middle line:84%
which is what happened, thanks
to the British empire-- or not,

00:46:39.776 --> 00:46:41.650 align:middle line:84%
no thanks, depending on
what your on that is.

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: And a lot
of peopled suffered.

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Imperialism has an
up and downside, for sure.

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: A lot of
people suffered.

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, a lot.

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:50.080 align:middle line:90%


00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: So that's
kind of what happened.

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And when the British empire
spread around the planet,

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:56.440 align:middle line:90%
it was with that mythology.

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Whether that comes from
Dee directly is arguable.

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.060 align:middle line:84%
But he certainly
had an influence.

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And the ideology of
the British Empire

00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:06.490 align:middle line:84%
was spreading Christianity,
and thereby civilization,

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:07.660 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And thereby saving people,
even at sword point.

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:15.100 align:middle line:84%
When global power transferred
to the American empire

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.920 align:middle line:84%
after the British empire
fell around World War I,

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.870 align:middle line:90%
the story was the same.

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:22.660 align:middle line:84%
America, particularly if you
look at the evangelical right

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:24.130 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:26.849 align:middle line:84%
There was a PEW
Forum study in 2006

00:47:26.849 --> 00:47:28.390 align:middle line:84%
that said that one
in three Americans

00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:32.650 align:middle line:84%
believes that Jesus will
return in our lifetimes.

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's far from
being a fringe belief.

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:37.932 align:middle line:84%
It's, in fact, probably the
dominant belief in America.

00:47:37.932 --> 00:47:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you drive
across the country

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and listen to the only stations
that have any wattage, which

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:45.370 align:middle line:84%
are Christian radio stations,
fundamentalist Christian radio

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:48.880 align:middle line:84%
stations, you hear the talk a
lot as you're driving along.

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's kind of shocking if
you're not part of that group.

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Right.

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:53.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And you look at things
like the success

00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:58.384 align:middle line:84%
of the Left Behind
books, which are

00:47:58.384 --> 00:47:59.800 align:middle line:84%
the most popular
books in America,

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.860 align:middle line:84%
I think outside of the Bible,
more than Stephen King.

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:08.170 align:middle line:84%
So literalism, fundamentalist
literalism, it's a big--

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:11.270 align:middle line:90%
and it's not just the public.

00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:14.590 align:middle line:84%
It's also, I think, that
apocalyptic literalism

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:17.710 align:middle line:84%
has been a driving force
in both British and then

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:18.580 align:middle line:90%
American politics.

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely in American politics
for the last 100 years.

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:20.885 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I was going

00:48:20.885 --> 00:48:23.800 align:middle line:84%
to ask you because elite power
circles, this really factors

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.670 align:middle line:84%
hugely in, almost like
in the belief it's

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:30.730 align:middle line:84%
best for all concerned to
hasten the end of times.

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:31.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's a danger.

00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:32.540 align:middle line:90%
That's dangerous.

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
dealing with right now.

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yeah.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:36.910 align:middle line:90%
I mean you look at--

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:38.440 align:middle line:84%
during the Reagan
administration,

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Reagan believed that it was
his divinely appointed gift,

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:43.930 align:middle line:84%
as inspired by Hal
Lindsay, who was

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:46.180 align:middle line:84%
a famous Christian
writer in the '70s,

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.890 align:middle line:84%
that it was the
end of the world.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And his divinely appointed
role was to hasten or shepherd

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:54.490 align:middle line:84%
humanity through the end of
days and the fight with Gog

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:56.720 align:middle line:90%
and Magog, which was Russia.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And that he was God's directly
chosen appointee to do that.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, this seems a
little eccentric

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:09.220 align:middle line:84%
until you realize that this was
a game that was and is being

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.030 align:middle line:90%
played with nuclear weapons.

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:13.246 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: I mean,
this was something

00:49:13.246 --> 00:49:16.340 align:middle line:84%
that was enacted as mutually
assured destruction.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:18.490 align:middle line:90%
And during the second Bush--

00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:21.940 align:middle line:84%
or Bush Two, the Bush,
Jr., administration,

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:24.700 align:middle line:84%
George Bush, also very
influenced by Billy Graham,

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:28.090 align:middle line:84%
by the evangelicals, believed
that it was his divine mission

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:30.160 align:middle line:84%
to hasten the
apocalypse by going

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.720 align:middle line:90%
to war in the Middle East.

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:36.430 align:middle line:84%
He famously attempted to elicit
the support of Jacques Chirac,

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:40.810 align:middle line:84%
in France, in the war effort,
by telling him that he saw--

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:43.660 align:middle line:84%
he'd had a vision in prayer
that he'd seen Gog and Magog

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.430 align:middle line:90%
at work in the Middle East.

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:48.190 align:middle line:84%
This is perhaps
not who we should

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:51.970 align:middle line:84%
have steering the ship in a 21st
century technological society.

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:53.140 align:middle line:90%
But it's certainly--

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's still there.

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:55.635 align:middle line:90%
It's still there.

00:49:55.635 --> 00:49:56.810 align:middle line:90%
It's steering the ship.

00:49:56.810 --> 00:49:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: But we need to
understand it because it's--

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.900 align:middle line:84%
to dismiss it, I
think would also

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:05.020 align:middle line:84%
be a mistake because so
many people believe it.

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:07.600 align:middle line:90%
And I'm always of the opinion--

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:12.400 align:middle line:84%
I've long been of the opinion,
as a journalist and a writer,

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.900 align:middle line:84%
if you want to
understand why people

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:15.730 align:middle line:84%
do the things that
they do, you have

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:18.196 align:middle line:90%
to look at what they believe.

00:50:18.196 --> 00:50:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
take it seriously

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:21.460 align:middle line:84%
at least that they
take it seriously,

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:23.579 align:middle line:84%
and not be dismissive
or look down at it.

00:50:23.579 --> 00:50:25.120 align:middle line:84%
I think that if we
want to understand

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:28.655 align:middle line:84%
each other as human beings,
we need to understand

00:50:28.655 --> 00:50:29.530 align:middle line:90%
each other's beliefs.

00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:33.064 align:middle line:84%
You can't understand why
the evangelical right does

00:50:33.064 --> 00:50:34.480 align:middle line:84%
what it does without
understanding

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:35.688 align:middle line:90%
the script they're following.

00:50:35.688 --> 00:50:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I think for that
reason, it's important to--

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:40.300 align:middle line:84%
for that reason and
many more, I think

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:42.377 align:middle line:90%
it's important to understand.

00:50:42.377 --> 00:50:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so, too.

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And I just recently interviewed
an author named Mark Stavish.

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And he had written
about egregores.

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And when you speak about
the notion of an egregore,

00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:57.310 align:middle line:84%
perhaps one of the biggest, most
powerful egregores in existence

00:50:57.310 --> 00:50:59.110 align:middle line:90%
is the end times notion.

00:50:59.110 --> 00:51:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yeah.

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that does
have a life of its own

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and does feed back to those
who are in positions of power

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.230 align:middle line:90%
in decision making.

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Absolutely, and
it's not just Christianity.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: All of the world
religions have that.

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the
fundamentalist world religions

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:16.100 align:middle line:90%
in particular, yes.

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yeah.

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:18.689 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:51:18.689 --> 00:51:20.980 align:middle line:84%
You know, I read a lot of
material from people who were

00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:26.041 align:middle line:84%
in Bush, Jr.'s White House and
things like that, and Reagan's.

00:51:26.041 --> 00:51:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
Republicans, by the way.

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:29.030 align:middle line:90%
It's Democrats as well.

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.980 align:middle line:90%
It's on both sides.

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:31.480 align:middle line:90%
As people get closer to--

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:35.398 align:middle line:90%


00:51:35.398 --> 00:51:38.350 align:middle line:84%
it's a mythology that's very
appealing to people in power

00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:42.970 align:middle line:84%
because it grants them a sense
of having a special divine

00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:45.310 align:middle line:90%
role to play on the world stage.

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And even people who don't
start out as very evangelical

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:52.220 align:middle line:84%
become very interested
in that way of thinking,

00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:55.420 align:middle line:90%
which is understandable.

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:58.984 align:middle line:84%
It's just something that's been
with humanity for a long time.

00:51:58.984 --> 00:52:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's not
just Christianity.

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.380 align:middle line:84%
It's lots of
different religions.

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:07.630 align:middle line:84%
My personal view
is yes-- and, we

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:10.464 align:middle line:84%
should focus on also some
sustainability plans.

00:52:10.464 --> 00:52:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Like, if the world
doesn't end, maybe we

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:13.220 align:middle line:84%
should make sure of things
are OK during the end times.

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:14.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm in your camp.

00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Nice to make some
better plans than that.

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:19.762 align:middle line:84%
So let's get down
to the notion--

00:52:19.762 --> 00:52:21.970 align:middle line:84%
we have about five minutes
left to kind of wrap this.

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:23.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's get down to the notion.

00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:25.780 align:middle line:84%
These people who are
power elite believe

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.880 align:middle line:84%
that they are among the
ones who will be saved.

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:32.020 align:middle line:84%
They are always among the
chosen ones, no matter what.

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:34.360 align:middle line:90%
And so who are the 144,000?

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:37.310 align:middle line:84%
How was that originally
put out in Dee's day?

00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: So in the
Book of Revelations,

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.280 align:middle line:84%
there's a bit about
the 144,000 that

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.230 align:middle line:84%
will be saved at the
end of the world.

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Elaine Pagels, who's a
fascinating and brilliant

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:50.410 align:middle line:84%
scholar on gnosticism, has a
very interesting take on this,

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:52.990 align:middle line:84%
where having examined the
original political context

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:54.300 align:middle line:90%
of this--

00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:57.100 align:middle line:84%
the evangelical Christians
will not like this.

00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:03.550 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Revelation was
written by John of Patmos

00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:06.235 align:middle line:84%
during the time following
the death of Christ,

00:53:06.235 --> 00:53:08.110 align:middle line:84%
from a very different
perspective of the rest

00:53:08.110 --> 00:53:10.790 align:middle line:90%
of the New Testament.

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:13.720 align:middle line:84%
The point she makes
very convincingly

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:15.304 align:middle line:84%
is that following
the death of Christ,

00:53:15.304 --> 00:53:17.053 align:middle line:84%
there were actually
two different factions

00:53:17.053 --> 00:53:17.950 align:middle line:90%
of Christians.

00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:22.736 align:middle line:84%
There were the Jewish converts
to the new religion of-- or it

00:53:22.736 --> 00:53:23.860 align:middle line:90%
wasn't even a new religion.

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:27.040 align:middle line:84%
There were the Jewish people
who believed that Christ

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.540 align:middle line:90%
was the Jewish messiah.

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And then many who
did not, which is now

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:33.520 align:middle line:90%
the mainstream view of Judaism,

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:38.530 align:middle line:84%
There were also--
when Saul of Tarsus

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:40.480 align:middle line:84%
had his conversion on
the road to Damascus

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.790 align:middle line:84%
and became St. Paul, long
after the death of Christ,

00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:46.510 align:middle line:84%
he said that he was given a
vision that he should open up

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:48.010 align:middle line:84%
the covenant to all
nations, meaning

00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:51.380 align:middle line:84%
the original covenant between
Moses and the Jewish people.

00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:52.840 align:middle line:90%
And that this was for everyone.

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:55.010 align:middle line:90%
And that it had to be opened.

00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:57.094 align:middle line:84%
And so he then became the
head of this new thing

00:53:57.094 --> 00:53:58.510 align:middle line:84%
called Christianity,
which has now

00:53:58.510 --> 00:54:01.090 align:middle line:84%
become the most successful
religion in world history.

00:54:01.090 --> 00:54:05.440 align:middle line:84%
But what he did was convert
Greek and Roman pagans,

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:08.230 align:middle line:84%
and even people from North
Africa, to this new religion.

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:14.940 align:middle line:84%
This was not-- you can imagine
the Jewish people who followed,

00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:18.085 align:middle line:84%
accepted Christ as the messiah,
being like, hey, wait a minute.

00:54:18.085 --> 00:54:19.600 align:middle line:90%
That's not what this is about.

00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Christ was here to fulfill
the covenant with us.

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:23.502 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't to be
open to all people.

00:54:23.502 --> 00:54:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And so what you have
in the New Testament

00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:30.550 align:middle line:84%
is the Pauline Letters, which
are from the camp following

00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:31.432 align:middle line:90%
St. Paul.

00:54:31.432 --> 00:54:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
Revelation, which

00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:36.020 align:middle line:84%
was written from the perspective
of the Jewish followers

00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:36.820 align:middle line:90%
of Christ.

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And in the Book of
Revelation, when

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.230 align:middle line:84%
they talk about the
144,000 to be saved,

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:44.440 align:middle line:84%
what that originally meant was
the Jewish followers of Christ.

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And that everyone else
was not to be saved,

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:49.780 align:middle line:90%
which is contentious.

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Contentious,
to say the least.

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:52.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So now, that's been
kind of flipped.

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you listen to
the Jehovah Witness,

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:56.830 align:middle line:84%
then it's a whole
different story again.

00:54:56.830 --> 00:54:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Sure.

00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's got their story.

00:54:58.090 --> 00:54:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everybody's
their story of the 144,000.

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Isn't religion fun?

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Isn't it fun?

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So we have just a couple
minutes left to take it back

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:08.230 align:middle line:90%
into this kind of larger story.

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:10.600 align:middle line:90%
How would you wrap this part--

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.060 align:middle line:84%
we literally have two minutes--
wrap this part of the story

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:15.699 align:middle line:84%
back into John Dee
and his contributions?

00:55:15.699 --> 00:55:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: I think that it's
important to understand

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:20.860 align:middle line:84%
that this time
period-- the ideas

00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:23.710 align:middle line:84%
that were formulated in this
time period are still with us.

00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:26.770 align:middle line:84%
I see John Dee as like
a computer programmer

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:30.550 align:middle line:84%
who created the computer code
that our society is running on.

00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:33.080 align:middle line:10%
And to understand
that code, and perhaps

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.080 align:middle line:10%
to change it and update
it for the modern world,

00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.627 align:middle line:10%
we should understand
where it came from.

00:55:37.627 --> 00:55:38.710 align:middle line:90%
And I particularly think--

00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:40.690 align:middle line:84%
I would particularly
like to underline

00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:45.550 align:middle line:84%
that the apocalyptic idea
is much more dangerous to us

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:47.834 align:middle line:84%
as a species now that
we have nuclear weapons.

00:55:47.834 --> 00:55:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know that.

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Now that we have
nanotechnology, biotechnology,

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:54.280 align:middle line:84%
the ability to kill people
many, many times over,

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.380 align:middle line:84%
everyone, all life,
when we're at the brink

00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:58.540 align:middle line:90%
of ecological collapse.

00:55:58.540 --> 00:55:59.950 align:middle line:90%
So perhaps we need a--

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:01.444 align:middle line:90%
John Dee created one myth.

00:56:01.444 --> 00:56:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we need a
new one that's--

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A counter myth.

00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: --a bit more
supportive-- yes-- of life.

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I couldn't agree more.

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And is it-- can we get our hands
on the "Monas Hieroglyphica?"

00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Sure.

00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:10.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:11.918 align:middle line:90%
You can find it online.

00:56:11.918 --> 00:56:13.870 align:middle line:90%
It's freely available as a PDF.

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And would you
recommend we all read it?

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: I would say,
start with "John Dee

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:19.580 align:middle line:84%
and the Empire of Angels,"
to get it in context.

00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:20.970 align:middle line:84%
It's very opaque if you
don't know the context.

00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say,
if you did all that in 10 pages,

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:24.240 align:middle line:90%
we need to read your book first.

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And I hear your book
is doing fabulously.

00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: It's doing very well.

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wow, you went through
four printings, how quickly?

00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: In the first month.

00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
first month, wow.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.698 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know why,
you deserve it.
