00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WENDIE COLTER: The
root causes in the way

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.800 align:middle line:84%
the medical world
talks about them

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.730 align:middle line:84%
and root causes the
way an intuitive would

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.730 align:middle line:84%
talk about them are really
two different things.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.147 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Yes, because, I

00:00:19.147 --> 00:00:22.630 align:middle line:84%
mean, as the standard medical
model goes, one size fits all.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: It's not unusual
for medical intuitives

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.910 align:middle line:84%
to be ahead of the
curve, when it comes

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.910 align:middle line:84%
to issues that the medical
world still doesn't quite

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.260 align:middle line:90%
have a handle on.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.450 align:middle line:84%
The challenge
there for people is

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.050 align:middle line:90%
that there are zillion choices.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: So what can
medical intuition do?

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can help narrow
down those choices.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
the mind emotional interface

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.460 align:middle line:90%
with that information.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: I could literally
see, in my mind's eye,

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.090 align:middle line:84%
into their physical body,
into their physiology

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.860 align:middle line:90%
into what was going on there.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And I could also
see the roots of it.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:84%
In other words, where it might
have begun for them emotionally

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:90%
or in their life story.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know, whether or
not, if that information would

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:90%
help them heal.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.010 align:middle line:84%
This is the key to
medical intuition,

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.070 align:middle line:90%
the way I practice it.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I want people to hear what it is
their body wants to tell them,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.280 align:middle line:90%
their energy field.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.380 align:middle line:84%
What's going on
that led to this.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.167 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.167 --> 00:01:19.750 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: With all that humanity
has been through the past few

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.450 align:middle line:10%
years, there's never been
a bigger gap in trust

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:10%
in the medical
systems of the world--

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.760 align:middle line:10%
misdiagnosis, unnecessary
treatments, doctor error--

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.680 align:middle line:10%
1/3 of deaths in America.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.957 align:middle line:84%
All of which creates a loss
of faith in the system.

00:01:32.957 --> 00:01:36.130 align:middle line:84%
So we turn to alternatives,
such as medical intuitives

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.000 align:middle line:90%
and healers.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Wendie Colter is spearheading
mainstream acceptance

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:84%
of medical intuition and
is here with us today.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.710 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Wendy.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.583 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:01:45.583 --> 00:01:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Thank you, Regina.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I so
respect what you do,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and I so respect that you are
taking it way further, not just

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.010 align:middle line:84%
as an individual,
but you're really

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.160 align:middle line:84%
looking to help integrate
medical intuition

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.310 align:middle line:84%
into the medical system,
which is a huge leap.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.320 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let me
ask you a quick question

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:84%
before we get into your
background and the story.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Is there any-- are
there any countries

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.530 align:middle line:84%
in the world in which
medical intuitives and energy

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle line:84%
healers have been
incorporated directly

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.980 align:middle line:90%
into the medical institutions?

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: That's
a great question.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.530 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that
in Australia, there

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.990 align:middle line:84%
have been some reports that
they're integrating Indigenous

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.600 align:middle line:84%
healers into the medical
system, which is wonderful.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fabulous.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.897 align:middle line:10%
>>COLTER: And I know
in other countries,

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:30.310 align:middle line:10%
there is more of an
acceptance for this,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.350 align:middle line:10%
kind of, culturally
more of an acceptance

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.400 align:middle line:10%
than there is in the US.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and I
remember, even from the '80s

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and forward, I think
it's always been

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.290 align:middle line:90%
used in the most elite circles.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, in many
of the higher-ups

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.807 align:middle line:84%
of governments and
monarchies and such,

00:02:46.807 --> 00:02:47.890 align:middle line:90%
they've used alternatives.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.860 align:middle line:84%
But I know in Russia,
for decades, they've

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.570 align:middle line:84%
used very, very advanced
esoteric healing techniques

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:84%
on their leaders, for example,
you know, in the oligarchy.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:10%
>>COLTER: Russia and
the Eastern bloc, these

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:10%
are culturally-accepting
areas where

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.900 align:middle line:10%
intuitive healers or medical
intuitives have more of-- they

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.490 align:middle line:10%
play more of a part
in health care.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, more holistic
thinking from their roots.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yes.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
agrarian roots.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.740 align:middle line:90%
So, OK.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.520 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's get into
and your own background.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Originally, as an energy
healer and how you segued over

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle line:90%
into medical intuitive work.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Well, as
an energy healer

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I started noticing
that, sometimes, clients

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:84%
would be able to let go of
something in their energy field

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.840 align:middle line:84%
and have a wonderful
healing experience.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes, they couldn't.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.240 align:middle line:90%
It was difficult for them.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was so curious, Regina,
as to why some people could heal

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and some were having
trouble with it.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed in my practice
that I could literally

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:84%
see, in my mind's eye,
into their physical body,

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.270 align:middle line:84%
into their physiology, into
what was going on there.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.400 align:middle line:84%
That was just a
talent I cultivated

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.250 align:middle line:90%
over years of visual intuition.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And I could also
see the roots of it.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:84%
In other words, where it might
have begun for them emotionally

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.430 align:middle line:90%
or in their life story.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.560 align:middle line:84%
So that became a real
curiosity for me.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
know whether or not

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle line:84%
if that information
would help them heal.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because, I mean,
as the standard medical model

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:90%
goes, one size fits all.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.963 align:middle line:90%
There's a drug rep--

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:23.763 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Right.

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --who
says, in the hospital

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.010 align:middle line:84%
does it deal with
them, and this is

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.620 align:middle line:84%
the drug you use for
everyone with this condition,

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:90%
a lot of times.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is how it
works, and that is so wrong.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Well--

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As individuals.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.100 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean it
can't work, but we have

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.918 align:middle line:90%
to go far deeper than that.

00:04:40.918 --> 00:04:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
you're talking about.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Because, now, you're
talking about going

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.130 align:middle line:90%
to underlying causes, right?

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Well, the
root causes in the way

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.680 align:middle line:84%
the medical world talks about
them and root causes the way

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.600 align:middle line:84%
an intuitive would talk
about them are really

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.600 align:middle line:90%
two different things.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: And one is not just
the physical roots, which

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.700 align:middle line:84%
is really where medicine stops,
but also the emotional, mental,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:90%
spiritual roots.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.960 align:middle line:90%
What happened in someone's life?

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.020 align:middle line:84%
How did this manifest
into a health issue?

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
one of the tenets

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:84%
that I teach about
medical intuition,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:84%
that every physical
manifestation also

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.225 align:middle line:84%
has emotional, mental,
and spiritual roots.

00:05:19.225 --> 00:05:20.350 align:middle line:90%
There's something going on.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, we'll do this
as a simple example.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going into
a medical appointment.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have some problem
with your lungs-- emphysema.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.920 align:middle line:90%
You have a history of smoking.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like, the root
cause, you're a smoker.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.870 align:middle line:90%
But if you let go beneath that--

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and I remember playing
with this a little bit.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.535 align:middle line:90%
I had a little years--

00:05:41.535 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:84%
many years ago, I had a
little hypnotherapy clinic.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I went through my little
six-month training course,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and I just happened to
have a natural skill at it,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.550 align:middle line:84%
so I could work
with people easily.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.800 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, one
of the things people

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.910 align:middle line:90%
came for was smoking.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:84%
But I remember
that the person who

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.770 align:middle line:84%
taught us who was
highly skilled, and they

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.320 align:middle line:90%
were third generation.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:84%
They said, no,
you got to go back

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.240 align:middle line:84%
to the emotional state they
were in the day they started

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.040 align:middle line:90%
smoking.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yes.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
I did that, I just

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.283 align:middle line:84%
found it incredible, where
you have someone who'd

00:06:14.283 --> 00:06:15.700 align:middle line:84%
gotten a fight
with their parents,

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and they were being defiant
and thought, heck with you,

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.630 align:middle line:84%
and went out with their friends
and started smoking just

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:90%
to show them.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, you get whatever comes
down 30, 40, 50 years later.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.108 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Well, there's so
much research on this now.

00:06:31.108 --> 00:06:31.908 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:31.908 --> 00:06:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: And when the research
started being published some

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:90%
years ago from the--

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.390 align:middle line:90%
I think it's the CDC.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:84%
They did years of
research, and they came up

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.550 align:middle line:84%
with something called adverse
childhood experiences,

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.960 align:middle line:84%
meaning ACEs, which means
early life trauma leading

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.730 align:middle line:90%
to later life health issues.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.235 align:middle line:84%
And every medical
intuitive that I ever knew,

00:06:51.235 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:84%
and myself included,
looked at that and went,

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.985 align:middle line:90%
well, thank goodness.

00:06:53.985 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Finally, there's scientific data
that shows exactly what we've

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:90%
been seeing all these years.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where is this ACEs
actually being applied, though?

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: It's being applied
in mostly psychology,

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.550 align:middle line:84%
psychotherapy,
psychoneuroimmunology,

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:10.450 align:middle line:90%
which is a new field.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a new field.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.363 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yes.

00:07:13.363 --> 00:07:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you work
together as well, yeah.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yes.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.117 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it's new
science essentially,

00:07:19.117 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think the
medical world is quite

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.280 align:middle line:84%
embraced it because I'm not sure
they know what to do with that.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind of where
medical intuition fills

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.137 align:middle line:90%
that gap, to be totally honest.

00:07:28.137 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So let's look at that.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So someone comes in, ACEs,
you see childhood trauma,

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.620 align:middle line:84%
but you're working with a
doctor under a medical plan.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Your insurance
covers the doctor,

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.900 align:middle line:84%
doesn't cover you
and the others.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.700 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: No.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.075 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do
we begin working

00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:42.760 align:middle line:84%
that as, say, the
parents of someone

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.130 align:middle line:84%
or for our own
bodies, for example.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Well, there's a
lot we can do on our own,

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and that's also something
that I'm interested in.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.550 align:middle line:90%
I do teach that.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.730 align:middle line:84%
How do people,
any average person

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.910 align:middle line:84%
begin that conversation
with your own body?

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.740 align:middle line:84%
That's never-- I
mean, who knows--

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.480 align:middle line:84%
where have you ever
heard that other

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.060 align:middle line:84%
than the mind body world,
which is wonderful.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But I like to teach people
how to use this intuitive

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:90%
skill for their own bodies.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:10.508 align:middle line:90%
OK, and you teach that.

00:08:10.508 --> 00:08:13.240 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into that
toward the end of the show.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.653 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
you talk about is--

00:08:15.653 --> 00:08:17.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, first of all, we
didn't get to where

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.440 align:middle line:84%
you segued into doing
full-time medical intuition.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.023 align:middle line:84%
So let's hear that
part of your story.

00:08:23.023 --> 00:08:23.823 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Sure.

00:08:23.823 --> 00:08:24.670 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So as I noticed, as I gave
my clients the information--

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.740 align:middle line:84%
before I did any kind of
healing work with them,

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I would look at their physical
body, and their physiology

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.220 align:middle line:84%
and their energy field as
well, and I would give them

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.919 align:middle line:84%
the information that
was apparent to me

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.230 align:middle line:84%
that had to do with
their imbalance, whatever

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:90%
was going on.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.870 align:middle line:84%
I found that they found that
information was so valuable.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.730 align:middle line:84%
What happened for
them-- and I'll give you

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.800 align:middle line:90%
a magic word that I use.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Their permission
level-- and that's

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.790 align:middle line:90%
an energetic marking, right?

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:middle line:84%
The permission level
started to raise.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:90%
And permission for what?

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.640 align:middle line:90%
Permission for healing, right?

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I did an energy
work after the session,

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.590 align:middle line:84%
boy, they were able to let go
of things that, probably, they

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:09.683 align:middle line:90%
couldn't have for a while.

00:09:09.683 --> 00:09:10.600 align:middle line:90%
They might have said--

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Probably
didn't even know existed.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.168 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Didn't
even know existed.

00:09:13.168 --> 00:09:15.220 align:middle line:84%
This is the key to
medical intuition the way

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.040 align:middle line:90%
I practice it.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.140 align:middle line:84%
I want people to hear what it is
their body wants to tell them,

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.280 align:middle line:90%
their energy field.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.810 align:middle line:84%
What's going on
that led to this.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And that I found
over the years is

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I found it even more
valuable than energy healing

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.745 align:middle line:84%
because it was the
precursor to healing.

00:09:32.745 --> 00:09:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:34.578 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it does.

00:09:34.578 --> 00:09:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So this requires a high
degree of responsibility

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:43.240 align:middle line:84%
and you say even a
different kind of ethics

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:90%
than in the medical industry.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.042 align:middle line:84%
Maybe explain what
you mean by that.

00:09:48.042 --> 00:09:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Well, I guess I'm
talking about both legal ethics

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual ethics.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Legal ethics are what
is my scope of practice

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:55.520 align:middle line:90%
as a medical intuitive.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't diagnose.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't have that license.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.830 align:middle line:84%
You have to know what
your scope of practice

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:84%
is legally, wherever-- what
state you're in or what country

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:03.590 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Spiritually, we
also don't want to overstep.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.810 align:middle line:84%
We want to make sure
that the client is

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
OK with the information
that they want to hear it.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So I check in with
people and make sure--

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
especially if I see
something pretty

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:21.520 align:middle line:84%
gritty from their history, I'm
going to make sure they're OK.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of ethical
training that I don't think

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.540 align:middle line:84%
gets taught a lot in the
energy healing world.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, particularly
intuitives, if they get a hit,

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:35.717 align:middle line:84%
they'll blurt it right out,
and that's a little dangerous.

00:10:35.717 --> 00:10:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It can be.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for example,
if you have someone

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:84%
whose psyche is fragile, and
they've just seen something,

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.020 align:middle line:84%
as you say, gritty,
something serious,

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.520 align:middle line:84%
something need
serious attention.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yeah.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
the mind-emotional interface

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:53.620 align:middle line:90%
with that information.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:90%
And at what point are you--

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know it's
highly individual.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:84%
You can see one person
who's like, give it to me.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.580 align:middle line:90%
I can take it.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.380 align:middle line:90%
And they can.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.300 align:middle line:90%
They'll say, OK, let's fix it.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:10%
Where another person might
be emotionally overwhelmed

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.830 align:middle line:10%
and devastated by what you said.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the
knowledge is almost

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.190 align:middle line:90%
working counter to the healing.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that complex a bit?

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Yeah, that's
a very deep question.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: I always-- this
is a joke I make, OK?

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.910 align:middle line:84%
I say, you can't hide
from a psychic, OK?

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, don't bother.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Because we're going
to see what there is to see.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.360 align:middle line:84%
But there is something
about the process

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:35.290 align:middle line:84%
that I use that I make sure
that what I'm looking at

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:36.090 align:middle line:90%
can be said.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Number one, that's an intuitive
connection with higher self,

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:90%
with this process that I use.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And I always let my client
know, if I say something

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.870 align:middle line:84%
or see something that is really
too much for you, stop me.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Very often, what I see
in people's energies

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.540 align:middle line:90%
is the need for more assistance.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.722 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's a huge part of
the medical intuitive process.

00:11:57.722 --> 00:12:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do you mean by
the need for more assistance?

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Helping people
get the help they need.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:84%
In other words, my
process is informational.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.760 align:middle line:90%
It's not a healing process.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.280 align:middle line:84%
It can be healing for
someone to hear something,

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.710 align:middle line:84%
but it's not actually
working on their energy.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So that information is what
they can take and get more help.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it's
emotional help.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, it's medical help.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, it's--

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Would you recommend
that if you see someone,

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.520 align:middle line:84%
for example, that's in the
state I'm talking about,

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.360 align:middle line:90%
where you see--

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.520 align:middle line:84%
I see there was some
trauma and pain that

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.110 align:middle line:90%
happened some time ago.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And it might be playing
out in your body.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.830 align:middle line:84%
You might want to
work with someone

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.510 align:middle line:84%
to work through
some of this trauma,

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.610 align:middle line:84%
and you almost set
it up that way.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Well, pretty
much like that, yeah.

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.450 align:middle line:84%
If that's what the
energy is asking for.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yeah.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So it goes across the
board, right down to, go

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.080 align:middle line:90%
get that thing fixed.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Well, I can't lay down
the law the way a doctor can,

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.530 align:middle line:84%
but I can certainly
make suggestions

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:59.010 align:middle line:84%
based on their energy field and
their higher self-information

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.490 align:middle line:90%
and what is being asked for.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
The key here is, what is the
body and biofield asking for?

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Because if we had that open line
of communication between mind

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and body on our own, we would
need a medical intuitive,

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.050 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.130 align:middle line:90%
We just do it.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:18.690 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is that the
body has its own consciousness.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:22.650 align:middle line:84%
The cells in our body have their
own awareness and the organs.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:24.720 align:middle line:84%
So they're talking
to us all the time,

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.420 align:middle line:84%
but it would be overwhelming
if we listen to all the time.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.115 align:middle line:90%
So we need to--

00:13:29.115 --> 00:13:30.990 align:middle line:84%
that is why people come
to medical intuitives

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:32.880 align:middle line:84%
because they want
that information.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'll go even further
with this, Regina.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.740 align:middle line:90%
When the body is feeling--

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:84%
when it's impacted in some way,
the body has a fear response.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:90%
It gets afraid.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it
because it's created

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:52.580 align:middle line:84%
the condition on some level to
reinforce or protect itself?

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.020 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
good observation.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yeah.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:01.298 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's case-by-case, in
my world, but sure, possibly.

00:14:01.298 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And there could be
a million reasons,

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.070 align:middle line:84%
to be honest, why
something would manifest.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:05.870 align:middle line:90%
Just a million.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:06.828 align:middle line:90%
It might be protection.

00:14:06.828 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:90%
It might be genetic.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:90%
It might be all kinds of things.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, speaking
on the subject of all kinds

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.253 align:middle line:90%
of things--

00:14:15.253 --> 00:14:17.420 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have to go
here if you don't want to--

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:22.850 align:middle line:84%
but in some work that's been
written about this, sometimes,

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.980 align:middle line:84%
it's not even--
sometimes it's ancestral.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yes.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've carried the
patterns of our ancestors.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's almost
interference from the outside,

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.450 align:middle line:84%
from deceased, and so
forth that might still

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:36.200 align:middle line:84%
be kind of clinging and trying
to work through us in some way.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever noticed
that in your work,

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.730 align:middle line:84%
where it seems that something
outside of the person

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.730 align:middle line:84%
is draining or
affecting that person?

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Well, I
think every intuitive

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.270 align:middle line:90%
has that understanding.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:52.370 align:middle line:84%
However, my perspective on it
is that what drains our energy,

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:84%
there's a permission
level for it,

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:84%
meaning there has
to be something

00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.660 align:middle line:84%
within our own mind-heart-spirit
psyche that allows for that.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's the big thing to say.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want it
taken the wrong way.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:06.170 align:middle line:90%
But as--

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, this is a
very intelligent audience.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I think we all understand
what you're saying.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Subconsciously, we may be
allowing ourselves to almost

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.890 align:middle line:90%
be victimized.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.650 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, have
our energy taken.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.940 align:middle line:84%
We haven't become clear
enough to say, I do this.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.400 align:middle line:84%
I give my energy away
ridiculously freely at times,

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
not even thinking about
the repercussions.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.170 align:middle line:90%
But there are repercussions.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And so, maybe you
can educate us now

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.840 align:middle line:84%
to help us understand
how do we best set

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.462 align:middle line:90%
those boundaries for ourselves.

00:15:37.462 --> 00:15:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Well, you're
talking about what

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I call energy hygiene, which
is something that isn't really

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.200 align:middle line:90%
well known.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And I wish it was
more well-known.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.650 align:middle line:84%
I've read about it in
my book, and I teach it.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And the whole point there is,
to keep ourselves grounded,

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:56.420 align:middle line:84%
shielded, you could say,
protected energetically

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.520 align:middle line:90%
in our own energy and our power.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And that helps us
navigate the waters

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:04.515 align:middle line:84%
of the world, where there's
just-- we talk about energy.

00:16:04.515 --> 00:16:06.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just bouncing around
all over the place,

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and especially in
these times, where

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:12.000 align:middle line:84%
we see so much polarization
and intense energy.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.620 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really important.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're bathed in
a field of thought forms.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yeah.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Our reality is
nothing but thought forms.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.210 align:middle line:90%
We're sitting in them.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:90%
They're all around us.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.280 align:middle line:84%
They're coming out
of us and into us.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.677 align:middle line:84%
And so, you call it
energy hygiene, right?

00:16:25.677 --> 00:16:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: I do, yes.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is in the book,
and I read about that.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.350 align:middle line:84%
But I just wanted
to get that out.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
an area that I find

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.160 align:middle line:90%
really interesting, which is--

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:84%
and I talked about it in
the opening of the show--

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.680 align:middle line:84%
often misdiagnosis or things
that can't be diagnosed easily.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.020 align:middle line:90%
There are some kind of--

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.660 align:middle line:84%
I think they call them
garbage bucket diagnoses,

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.850 align:middle line:84%
where it's just a set
of random symptoms.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:51.710 align:middle line:84%
You just call it
something because we

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.300 align:middle line:90%
don't know what to do with it.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So that, together with
people who can't really

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.540 align:middle line:84%
speak for themselves, let's
talk about this whole area

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:00.380 align:middle line:90%
for a moment.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Well, undiagnosed or
difficult to diagnose issues

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:08.089 align:middle line:84%
are the meat and potatoes
of medical intuition,

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:11.812 align:middle line:84%
not only from the medical side,
for the doctors who work with

00:17:11.812 --> 00:17:14.270 align:middle line:84%
medical intuitives-- and I've
worked with many doctors over

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.070 align:middle line:90%
the years--

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:18.770 align:middle line:84%
but for the patients themselves,
the clients themselves.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:22.010 align:middle line:84%
They feel kicked around
by the medical industry

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.430 align:middle line:84%
because there's no place for
them to get the help they need.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And some really good examples
of this over the years

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:31.130 align:middle line:84%
were Lyme disease before
it was understood,

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.070 align:middle line:84%
what's called SIBO,
small intestinal bowel

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.210 align:middle line:90%
bacterial overgrowth.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:39.440 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing that 15 to 20
years ago in people's guts.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a proliferation
of bad bacteria,

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't-- what
did they do about it?

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Their gastroenterologist
didn't even recognize it.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's not unusual
for medical intuitives

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.610 align:middle line:84%
to be ahead of the
curve, when it comes

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:56.000 align:middle line:84%
to issues that the medical
world still doesn't quite

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:56.990 align:middle line:90%
have a handle on.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Once
you tell them, I'm

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:01.340 align:middle line:84%
seeing this bacterial
overgrowth or whatnot,

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.250 align:middle line:84%
and there's no real means
of dealing with that,

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.740 align:middle line:84%
there must be some
through analysis,

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:84%
if you can get the doctor
to authorize the tests.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, all
these are scheduled

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:17.062 align:middle line:84%
things and a matter of need,
and expense, and so forth.

00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Oh, don't
get me started there.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: The medical world
is-- and the physicians

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.270 align:middle line:84%
that I work with that I
train, they all get it.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.990 align:middle line:90%
The nurses, they all get it.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:84%
They know the system
is broken, but you

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:90%
have to start somewhere.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:35.720 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that in
my work, I refer people

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:84%
to what would typically
be called alternative

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.220 align:middle line:90%
or integrative fields.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Because naturopathic
medicine, Chinese medicine,

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Ayurvedic medicine,
chiropractic,

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:50.570 align:middle line:84%
so many fields have
so many great ways

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.800 align:middle line:84%
to help heal various
things and can really

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.940 align:middle line:84%
get to the prescriptions
or whatever that will help.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.860 align:middle line:84%
The key there and the
challenge there for

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.490 align:middle line:84%
people is that there
are zillion choices.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So what can medical
intuition do?

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.758 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can help narrow
down those choices,

00:19:06.758 --> 00:19:08.550 align:middle line:84%
and that's one way I've
worked with doctors

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:10.800 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the testing
that they might suggest.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:84%
I can help narrow those
choices, and medical intuitive

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:90%
should be able to do that.

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And for our clients,
we can help hone where

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.580 align:middle line:90%
the best path forward might be.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is there an
increase right now in doctors

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.100 align:middle line:84%
becoming naturopathic doctors
and also functional medicine?

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yes.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.608 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would
think this would really

00:19:29.608 --> 00:19:32.070 align:middle line:84%
with the young people coming
into medicine would be really

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.690 align:middle line:90%
on the rise, right?

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Integrative
medicine, functional medicine,

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.050 align:middle line:84%
and all the things that
integrate with those two

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:44.340 align:middle line:84%
fields, that means conventional
medicine integrating, quote,

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.010 align:middle line:84%
"alternative practices,"
or complementary, I think,

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.000 align:middle line:90%
is the word now.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And you see, because,
obviously, most med students

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:51.960 align:middle line:90%
are the youngs.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.760 align:middle line:90%
They're young.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yes.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.117 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
find that they're

00:19:55.117 --> 00:19:56.580 align:middle line:84%
a little more open
to all of this

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.477 align:middle line:90%
than their parents' generation?

00:19:58.477 --> 00:20:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Well, I've
had the privilege

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.860 align:middle line:84%
of teaching at the
Andrew Weil Center

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.850 align:middle line:84%
at their program for fourth
year medical students,

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and they have just loved
this because it makes sense

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:10.890 align:middle line:90%
to them, right?

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:84%
The understanding and
awareness of something

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.730 align:middle line:84%
beyond the physical body that
influences the physical body,

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.280 align:middle line:90%
that's not new science.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.080 align:middle line:90%
That's old science.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
way old science.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Yes, thank goodness,
it's been resurrected.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So I asked it a little
bit ago, and we'll

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.140 align:middle line:90%
go back into this now.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:84%
What about people who
can't speak for themselves

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.020 align:middle line:84%
or where a baby's in
distress, and they don't

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.850 align:middle line:90%
have the means to diagnose it?

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And other vulnerable groups
that can't speak for themselves.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.182 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about this.

00:20:41.182 --> 00:20:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: You really have
the nail on the head.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:47.910 align:middle line:84%
That is such a potent
piece of the puzzle.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you a little
story from my own cases.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:56.340 align:middle line:84%
I had a wonderful client, who
had had an injury when they

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.612 align:middle line:84%
were an infant that was
never diagnosed properly,

00:20:59.612 --> 00:21:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't until
they were a teenager,

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.653 align:middle line:90%
and they couldn't get out of it.

00:21:02.653 --> 00:21:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It was a back injury that nobody
could find or even acknowledge.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And this gentleman, by the
time he came to see me,

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.990 align:middle line:84%
what was caught in
his back was not only

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.700 align:middle line:84%
the injury which finally
was diagnosed correctly,

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and he had surgery
after surgery, but all

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:24.510 align:middle line:84%
of this anger and frustration
that he was shushed

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.773 align:middle line:84%
and not listened
to when he was--

00:21:26.773 --> 00:21:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With all the pain.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Exactly.

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:84%
He was in pain from the time
he was a little tiny baby.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: And so,
this is, honestly,

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:38.250 align:middle line:84%
not that unusual, sadly,
in terms of people

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.600 align:middle line:90%
being heard correctly.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So you're asking about babies,
and I've done work with babies.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:47.460 align:middle line:84%
I've done work with people
who are with their family

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:53.130 align:middle line:84%
members who want to-- people who
are in dementia or in, somehow,

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.980 align:middle line:84%
out of commission, and
that's a great place

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.370 align:middle line:90%
to use medical intuition.

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:58.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I love that.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And the whole notion of if you
can articulate for yourself,

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.730 align:middle line:90%
still not being heard.

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Yeah,
well, that's rampant.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that,
to me, is probably

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.440 align:middle line:84%
the biggest frustration is
someone who meets me and has

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.040 align:middle line:84%
known me for seven minutes,
telling me what's going on,

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.640 align:middle line:90%
when they have no idea.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they
a general theme that

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:90%
happens among humanity.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's not
how doctors choose

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.010 align:middle line:90%
to operate for the most part.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:32.820 align:middle line:84%
They're being held in that
pattern by the system itself.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yeah.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:90%
That's the biggest one.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.320 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed a lot of
doctors for the book

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.510 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to find
out what they think,

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.760 align:middle line:90%
and that's everything they said.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:84%
They have 20 minutes or
15 minutes with a patient.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.410 align:middle line:84%
There's no time to get
this deeper history.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:51.030 align:middle line:84%
There's no time to
really understand.

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, they might see
patients over the years

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and have an understanding
of their life,

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.520 align:middle line:84%
but what about what's
under the surface?

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.730 align:middle line:84%
What about when the patient
doesn't articulate because it's

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:03.250 align:middle line:84%
a little mysterious to them, or
they are not even aware of it.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.360 align:middle line:84%
This is really where
medical intuition can

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:90%
fill these holes absolutely.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to
get into a study you did that I

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.690 align:middle line:90%
loved that was in the book.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.050 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, you
have begun, as you

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:20.520 align:middle line:84%
said, teaching through
various medical institutions,

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:26.010 align:middle line:84%
being a guest lecturer,
and where are you finding--

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:84%
where are you finding the
biggest resonance and uptake,

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and where are you finding
the greatest resistance?

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Oh, gosh, it's
such a good question.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, nurses were the first
to embrace because they've

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.543 align:middle line:84%
been using intuition in their
own and work for decades,

00:23:43.543 --> 00:23:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and they've also
written about it.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And they've also done
over 30 years of research

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.860 align:middle line:84%
on nursing intuition, so they
validated that whole concept

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:53.660 align:middle line:90%
of intuition.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.590 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so grateful to them.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:24:00.740 align:middle line:84%
So nurses are a big part of
who come to learn from me.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.780 align:middle line:84%
But I will say that over
the past five years,

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:09.710 align:middle line:84%
more and more physicians, MDs,
DOs, people in the health care

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:14.060 align:middle line:84%
field, like PAs, physician
assistants, certainly,

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:18.170 align:middle line:84%
massage therapists and
health coaches even,

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:84%
are drawn to this
because of the value

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.650 align:middle line:84%
that it can bring to their
patients and clients.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:28.010 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly mental
health care as well.

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:29.450 align:middle line:90%
There's just really--

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Regina, I talk about the
skill as a foundational skill.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not a modality.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.330 align:middle line:84%
You can learn a
zillion modalities.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:37.130 align:middle line:90%
This is not that.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.740 align:middle line:84%
This supports all
of those modalities.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, absolutely.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it should be the
foundational partnership

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.130 align:middle line:84%
that happens here
is for someone to be

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.670 align:middle line:84%
able to look in the entire being
and someone on the other end

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:52.920 align:middle line:84%
to use the very best of
technology that's available

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:53.720 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.887 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that would be a
perfect working partnership.

00:24:55.887 --> 00:24:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So you have developed some of
those working partnerships,

00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:59.510 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: I have.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I worked with some
doctors and I've

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.500 align:middle line:84%
been doing that for 20
years-- over 20 years.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And I work directly
with their-- sometimes

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.140 align:middle line:84%
they'll refer me
to their patients,

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and I do that, a lot of that,
which is really interesting.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.550 align:middle line:90%
And we want to see more of that.

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:21.050 align:middle line:84%
We want collaborations between
doctors and medical intuitives.

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:22.717 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you a
little story if I can.

00:25:22.717 --> 00:25:23.517 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please.

00:25:23.517 --> 00:25:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: One of the
wonderful doctors

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed for the book,
who has this breakthrough

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:32.780 align:middle line:84%
model, where she works directly
with her medical intuitive,

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.980 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful gentleman, and she's
an integrative family medicine

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.420 align:middle line:90%
doctor in New York.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.960 align:middle line:84%
She and her medical
intuitive and her patient

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.720 align:middle line:84%
sit together in the
exam room, and they

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.280 align:middle line:90%
have this wonderful dialogue.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I love it.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: I mean, it is
the future of health care--

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.055 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: --as I could
see it and, certainly,

00:25:52.055 --> 00:25:55.880 align:middle line:84%
the way I would like to see
medical intuition utilized.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.933 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that.

00:25:57.933 --> 00:26:00.350 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking, it was
reminding me of someone I met,

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:03.650 align:middle line:90%
probably 15, 20 years ago now.

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Trying to say-- yeah, I
probably interviewed him

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.680 align:middle line:90%
18 years ago or so.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.400 align:middle line:84%
A fellow named Jay Caliendo,
who you have in your book.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yes.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I had the
experience of, actually,

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:19.040 align:middle line:84%
in a Starbucks, inadvertently
having him do a reading on me--

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.063 align:middle line:90%
you feel stripped naked a bit.

00:26:21.063 --> 00:26:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, what,
we're in Starbucks.

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.120 align:middle line:90%
We're just talking business.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, you
don't know what I do.

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this right now.

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:29.600 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like this.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was a little
disconcerting, initially,

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:36.500 align:middle line:84%
because you see this person
looking through you, not

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.550 align:middle line:84%
at you, but through
you and scanning.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:43.220 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't tell him anything.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And the thing he found was so
profound and profoundly weird.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, it
is profoundly weird.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.140 align:middle line:90%
And he saw it right off the bat.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I don't know
what to tell you about it.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.110 align:middle line:90%
I mean, good luck.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Let me know if
you figure it out.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.390 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, it
only took him just really

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:07.070 align:middle line:84%
seconds to dial in and see
the unique aspect of my being,

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:09.805 align:middle line:84%
for example, right to
the core part of it.

00:27:09.805 --> 00:27:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And so, you write about
him in his book, your book,

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:15.050 align:middle line:84%
too, because he actually
worked with the Mayo Clinic,

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and he was a police officer
who had this ability, right?

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And they would have downed
and injured police officers,

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.920 align:middle line:84%
and he would say, yeah,
what I'm seeing here--

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and they did work together
with the medical industry,

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.743 align:middle line:84%
including the Mayo
Clinic, right?

00:27:31.743 --> 00:27:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: There was
a wonderful write up

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:37.010 align:middle line:84%
and a medical journal about
his work with the doctor.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:40.010 align:middle line:84%
They did this whole
interview with the doctor

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and with him about his process
and how they work together.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:45.180 align:middle line:90%
That's what I loved about it.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: It's so fascinating.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And this was, I don't
know, decades ago,

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.390 align:middle line:90%
a couple of decades ago.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like, why hasn't
that taken all--

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, why haven't we
gotten any further than this?

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yeah, that's my goal.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
have to prove it.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:04.580 align:middle line:84%
You have to also
create something,

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.640 align:middle line:84%
if not standardized, at
least, a place where people

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.250 align:middle line:84%
can have be somewhat
credentialed

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:16.490 align:middle line:84%
so that the medical industry
can start trusting that there's

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:17.840 align:middle line:90%
someone valid to go to.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.920 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about studies and
including the external studies

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and the one you did
with the 67 people.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yeah.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:27.350 align:middle line:10%
The challenge with
medical intuition,

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:30.920 align:middle line:10%
just like the challenge
with all energy-based skills

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:35.720 align:middle line:10%
is research and validation,
and we need more of that.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.660 align:middle line:84%
When I looked at the research
on medical intuition,

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:43.340 align:middle line:84%
there was very little other
than Dr. Norm Shealy tested

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Carolyn Mace, and he wrote some
journal articles about that.

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:50.195 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Daniel Bonner did
some articles about it.

00:28:50.195 --> 00:28:51.320 align:middle line:90%
He's done his own research.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.030 align:middle line:84%
He's no longer with
us, unfortunately.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.330 align:middle line:84%
But there have been little
bits and pieces over the years,

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and they've been
problematic studies

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.770 align:middle line:90%
in that they've been small.

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:02.970 align:middle line:84%
The study designs
have been challenging

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:04.220 align:middle line:90%
because what are we measuring?

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.110 align:middle line:90%
We're measuring intuition.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.850 align:middle line:90%
How do you measure that?

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.308 align:middle line:84%
And so, when I looked
at that, I realized

00:29:10.308 --> 00:29:11.975 align:middle line:84%
that I'd been teaching
for quite a while

00:29:11.975 --> 00:29:14.120 align:middle line:84%
that my students are
heading their marks.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.960 align:middle line:84%
We're getting incredible
practicum information,

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and they have to do a lot
of hours in my program.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.250 align:middle line:90%
And we document everything.

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:24.515 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing just
the accuracy levels,

00:29:24.515 --> 00:29:25.640 align:middle line:90%
which were just phenomenal.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.420 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, there's
got to be a way to has this.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So I worked with some
colleagues at UCSD,

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.882 align:middle line:84%
including Dr. Paul Mills, who
I think has been on your show.

00:29:34.882 --> 00:29:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Paul Mills is
married to Tiffany Burstein--

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Married to Tiffany
Burstein, who's a colleague.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --wrote his own book.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:40.945 align:middle line:90%
I interviewed him recently.

00:29:40.945 --> 00:29:42.467 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yes, he's wonderful.

00:29:42.467 --> 00:29:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And the study was to
validate the accuracy

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:51.160 align:middle line:84%
of medical intuition
in a qualitative way

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.070 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't have access
to all of the medical records.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:57.730 align:middle line:90%
So we did what we could.

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And so, what we did was, we had
67 participants, some of whom

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.810 align:middle line:90%
were patients at UCSD Medical.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.540 align:middle line:84%
We had five of my
graduate students,

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and we set up as blinded
a study as we could.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.320 align:middle line:84%
The intuitives did about a
half an hour, an hour session,

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.960 align:middle line:90%
with each of the participants.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.590 align:middle line:90%
We have our eyes closed.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:21.850 align:middle line:84%
We don't look at you, so
we don't have visual cues.

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.730 align:middle line:84%
The participants didn't
tell us anything.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, they
filled out a survey.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And from that
survey, we found out

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.310 align:middle line:84%
how accurate they felt
the medical intuitive was.

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is just an
exploratory way to find out.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the medical
intuitive was talking to them

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:40.628 align:middle line:84%
and sharing with them what
they had seen, what they

00:30:40.628 --> 00:30:41.920 align:middle line:90%
were seeing as they went along.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Exactly.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.690 align:middle line:90%
It was one-on-one

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.567 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Sometimes, it was over
the internet or over the phone.

00:30:46.567 --> 00:30:48.700 align:middle line:84%
But there's no conversation
in this process.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.130 align:middle line:84%
It's very much, we're just
going to tell you what we see.

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: So that was
the premise of it.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, we
read all the surveys,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.180 align:middle line:90%
and we tallied it all up.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:03.040 align:middle line:84%
We worked with the
statistician, and we came out

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.510 align:middle line:84%
with some really
wonderful numbers.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:08.950 align:middle line:84%
We found that the participants
rated the medical intuitives

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:14.800 align:middle line:84%
as 94% accurate in locating and
evaluating their primary health

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.783 align:middle line:84%
issue, which is really
such a great number.

00:31:17.783 --> 00:31:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's huge.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: It's huge.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.870 align:middle line:84%
We also found that they
rated the medical intuitives

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:28.840 align:middle line:84%
as 98% accurate in describing
life experience that

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.150 align:middle line:90%
related to their health issue.

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Now, that is wonderful.

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: That is wonderful.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are
extraordinary numbers.

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yeah.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:37.420 align:middle line:90%
There's more.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.400 align:middle line:84%
The other one I'll
pull out here is

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.950 align:middle line:84%
the one that made all
the doctors ears perk up,

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and that was, we
asked the participants

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:47.110 align:middle line:84%
if they'd had a known
diagnosis, if they they'd had

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:48.610 align:middle line:90%
a diagnosis from their doctors.

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:49.790 align:middle line:90%
We didn't ask what it was.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:51.790 align:middle line:90%
We just asked, do you have one?

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.820 align:middle line:84%
About half, 49%, said,
yes, we have one.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And of that 49%, we
said, how consistent

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.040 align:middle line:84%
was the medical intuitive
with how they described what

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.140 align:middle line:90%
they saw with that diagnosis?

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:06.460 align:middle line:84%
94% accuracy or
consistency with that

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.160 align:middle line:84%
known diagnosis, and
that is a missing--

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.980 align:middle line:84%
that's like the
missing piece, right?

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:12.910 align:middle line:90%
The missing link.

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And with all of
the information, we

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.680 align:middle line:90%
were able to get the survey--

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.880 align:middle line:84%
excuse me-- the study published
in the "Journal of Integrative

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.320 align:middle line:90%
and Complementary Medicine."

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that's a big deal.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Oh, it's enormous
deal because this work is not

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:31.570 align:middle line:90%
very well acknowledged.

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And I will tell you, that
it's the first study published

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.660 align:middle line:84%
in over 20 years
on this subject.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:41.530 align:middle line:84%
With the size of cohort
we had, with the results

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:43.920 align:middle line:84%
we came out with,
we're so proud of it.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So once that
was published-- how

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:46.750 align:middle line:90%
long ago was that published?

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: 2020.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 2020.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yeah.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So since the
publication of that,

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.810 align:middle line:84%
has there been any kind
of movement of the needle?

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Well, yes and no.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.620 align:middle line:84%
These kinds of studies,
they need funding,

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.970 align:middle line:90%
to be totally frank about it.

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And funding can be a
little challenging,

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.600 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking about
something that isn't really

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:07.400 align:middle line:90%
well known.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Reiki,
and healing touch,

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.520 align:middle line:84%
and some of these
wonderful modalities

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.080 align:middle line:84%
are more known now,
even in hospitals.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's more awareness
and, therefore, more funding.

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:18.780 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to
medical intuition,

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.750 align:middle line:90%
it's still an unknown field.

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
I'm out there every day,

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.090 align:middle line:90%
working to raise awareness--

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you are.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: --and get some funding
for this because we feel--

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:32.760 align:middle line:90%
let me back up.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: In all
the studies I read

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:37.230 align:middle line:84%
over the years, that really
start back in the early--

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.360 align:middle line:90%
like, the early 70s.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Every study, even if
it was inconclusive,

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.990 align:middle line:84%
we found that all of the
doctors and researchers

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:47.718 align:middle line:84%
said in their
discussion part, which

00:33:47.718 --> 00:33:50.010 align:middle line:84%
is at the end, where they
say, they give their opinions

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:52.440 align:middle line:90%
about this field of this work.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:57.000 align:middle line:84%
If this could be taught, if
this could be studied more,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000 align:middle line:84%
if this could be validated,
this would change

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.315 align:middle line:90%
the paradigm of medicine.

00:34:01.315 --> 00:34:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: And I'm right
there with that, obviously.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.930 align:middle line:84%
So we need more brave
people to step forward.

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And funding, where it
can really be useful.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:14.370 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's go to
the personal part

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:17.100 align:middle line:84%
because people are listening
to this and thinking, gosh,

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.719 align:middle line:84%
that's something
I'd like to learn.

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:20.429 align:middle line:84%
That might be
something I want to do.

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:24.989 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
innate capacities.

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:29.190 align:middle line:84%
There are some people who
are, certainly, just more open

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and can access this a little
more easily than other people.

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:36.179 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an array of
people out there, saying,

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:37.330 align:middle line:90%
this is cool.

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:38.130 align:middle line:90%
This is the future.

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:39.699 align:middle line:90%
I want to do this.

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So what would you
look for in yourself?

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Well, here's
my philosophy on that.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.310 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can do this.

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:48.960 align:middle line:90%
It's an innate skill.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.179 align:middle line:84%
Intuition is not for
some and not for others.

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:55.139 align:middle line:84%
That's a false
notion in my world.

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:57.390 align:middle line:84%
I've taught people who
are complete skeptics.

00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And boy, in the medical world,
they should be skeptics.

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.900 align:middle line:90%
So I don't hold to that.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So anyone
can be taught?

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Well, yeah, sure.

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So a lot
of times, you find

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:11.520 align:middle line:84%
people who are
very like-- taking

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.528 align:middle line:90%
in everything since childhood.

00:35:14.528 --> 00:35:15.820 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that class.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people watching this--

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.800 align:middle line:84%
we have a number of people
watching right now that

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.050 align:middle line:84%
are in that class where
they see everything,

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and they've been lost in
streams of data their whole life

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.980 align:middle line:90%
and want to put it to use.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, we'll go to the
part, the segment of society

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.140 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't see everything
but can be taught, OK?

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: So people
who are wide open.

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:35.570 align:middle line:90%
They got the moonroof open.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:36.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:37.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.513 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Very often,
those are the empaths,

00:35:39.513 --> 00:35:40.540 align:middle line:90%
the clear sentience.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:41.340 align:middle line:90%
They feel it.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.510 align:middle line:90%
They sense it.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.770 align:middle line:90%
They're overwhelmed.

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:45.960 align:middle line:90%
They're bombarded, really.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.887 align:middle line:84%
And that's where energy
hygiene comes in.

00:35:47.887 --> 00:35:50.220 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you've got to learn
how to monitor and manage

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.120 align:middle line:90%
your energy.

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're just
going to be tossed around

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.170 align:middle line:90%
by this intuitive information.

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:59.725 align:middle line:84%
So that's a skill set
that needs honing.

00:35:59.725 --> 00:36:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
need to learn to have

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.300 align:middle line:84%
a little more
boundaries, protection,

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.340 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, if they're
going to go into this.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yes.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And again, I keep hearkening
back to what's in the book

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:13.020 align:middle line:90%
and what I teach.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.550 align:middle line:84%
These are important
skills to learn

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.145 align:middle line:84%
for anyone who is
highly intuitive

00:36:17.145 --> 00:36:21.540 align:middle line:84%
or feels that kind of sense
of bombardment or overload.

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:22.410 align:middle line:90%
Critical.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Critical.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.318 align:middle line:84%
And I know many of
your guests talk

00:36:24.318 --> 00:36:28.440 align:middle line:84%
about grounding, and shielding,
and monitoring, and managing,

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.980 align:middle line:90%
but that's step one.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.260 align:middle line:90%
You've got to have that.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's a skill that,
actually, literally,

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:34.510 align:middle line:90%
anyone can learn.

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:37.507 align:middle line:84%
But for those who are highly
sensitive, it's a good idea.

00:36:37.507 --> 00:36:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's why I'm asking.

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Because if they don't
do that, someone

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.950 align:middle line:84%
who would seem like they'd be
the perfect medical intuitive

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.990 align:middle line:84%
because they see
everything, what

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:49.230 align:middle line:84%
happens if they don't
do that due diligence?

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Oh, well, you know,
I've been working in this field

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:56.670 align:middle line:84%
now as a hobby and then as a
career for a long, long time.

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And back in the
day, you saw a lot

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:02.850 align:middle line:84%
of really unhealthy intuitives,
physically unhealthy.

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Taking everything
on, getting mixed up

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:07.120 align:middle line:90%
in the emotions of the person.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: It can be
very detrimental.

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, I really
emphasize the energy hygiene

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.600 align:middle line:90%
part critical.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.170 align:middle line:84%
You've got to work
on yourself first.

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:19.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, let's
talk about a person

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:23.130 align:middle line:84%
who seems to be impermeable
to outside influences,

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:26.010 align:middle line:84%
but who knows this is
necessary and totally

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:27.780 align:middle line:84%
resonates with
what you're saying,

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.750 align:middle line:84%
and they want to give it
a shot and be trained.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:36.848 align:middle line:84%
Now, they don't seem to be at
the whim of external energies.

00:37:36.848 --> 00:37:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Well, we're
always at the window.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We are, but they
don't appear to be, right?

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk about
a person more solid,

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.900 align:middle line:84%
maybe coming in a
little skeptical,

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.812 align:middle line:90%
but wants to give it a try.

00:37:47.812 --> 00:37:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Well, you know,
what's interesting is

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:54.120 align:middle line:84%
that the medical doctors that
are attracted to this, very

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.330 align:middle line:84%
often, are both
skeptical and excited.

00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, sure.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: And as you
should be, right?

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And I welcome skepticism
because my philosophy

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:04.710 align:middle line:90%
is, don't believe me.

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Try it.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Practice.

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And the more my
students practice,

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:10.650 align:middle line:84%
the more they see their
accuracy rates rise.

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:12.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's not about accuracy.

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:15.870 align:middle line:84%
It's about intuitive
efficacy, you could say.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:20.640 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm teaching, is
how to tune in and be aware of

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and use the information
that you're receiving

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:27.690 align:middle line:84%
and deliberately ask for
and receive and impart

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:29.580 align:middle line:84%
that information
that's the practice.

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:34.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's wonderful
to watch my students

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:38.070 align:middle line:84%
that come in at all different
places in this continuum of,

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:38.983 align:middle line:90%
I believe in it.

00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:39.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in it.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm skeptical.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:42.910 align:middle line:90%
I do it anyway.

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And learn how to
hone it and use it

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.520 align:middle line:84%
as a highly developed
skill in their work.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.320 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I mean,
I've interviewed

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.800 align:middle line:84%
quite a few people that
have been in remote viewing

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.350 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:55.210 align:middle line:90%
So there's no difference?

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Well, there's a
difference in the use of it,

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and there's maybe a difference
in the way it's practiced.

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:01.155 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The way
it's practiced,

00:39:01.155 --> 00:39:02.830 align:middle line:84%
but the actual
function of it is to be

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:05.365 align:middle line:84%
able to see beyond the
physical senses with accuracy.

00:39:05.365 --> 00:39:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Sure.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:06.715 align:middle line:90%
Non-local consciousness.

00:39:06.715 --> 00:39:08.382 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
non-local consciousness.

00:39:08.382 --> 00:39:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And they have said, repeatedly,
starting with Russell Targ,

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:16.152 align:middle line:84%
who I interviewed
first in the mid-'80s.

00:39:16.152 --> 00:39:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: He's amazing.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:18.068 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's amazing.

00:39:18.068 --> 00:39:20.350 align:middle line:84%
But he's talking about, a
lot of times, the people

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:24.400 align:middle line:84%
they brought in had no
instinct for it whatsoever

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.830 align:middle line:84%
and turned out to be
some of the best viewers

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.140 align:middle line:84%
because they came in just clean,
clear, and they wanted proof.

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yeah.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.750 align:middle line:90%
And that is a wonderful thing.

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.870 align:middle line:90%
And so, I welcome skeptics.

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And I have no problem
with it because they're

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.830 align:middle line:84%
going to show themselves
what they can do.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:43.030 align:middle line:84%
So now, in our last
few minutes, let's

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:47.200 align:middle line:84%
talk about what we can
do, and some techniques,

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.730 align:middle line:84%
and how we begin ourselves,
working with our own bodies,

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:54.640 align:middle line:84%
for example, and how we
start dialing in which--

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.840 align:middle line:90%
we're coming full circle.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.150 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
that in the beginning.

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Well, the way I
see it is, a lot of people

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:05.240 align:middle line:84%
talk about meditation techniques
and quieting the mind.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.970 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that, Regina.

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:08.560 align:middle line:90%
My mind is way too busy.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
not everybody can.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.030 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.753 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: So I don't teach that.

00:40:11.753 --> 00:40:14.050 align:middle line:84%
What I teach is,
open the dialogue

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:17.440 align:middle line:84%
and use your mind
as a visual tool

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.470 align:middle line:84%
for visually reaching
into the body

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and having discussion with
your liver, your kidneys,

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.730 align:middle line:90%
your digestive system, right?

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And these are wonderful
skills for everyone to use,

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:29.720 align:middle line:84%
and anyone can
learn how to do it.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.410 align:middle line:84%
It takes a little
practice in getting

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:34.990 align:middle line:84%
from where we are in
our conscious awareness

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:39.040 align:middle line:84%
to where we want to be in that
intuitive internal awareness.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's some skills
involved with that,

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:42.490 align:middle line:90%
some tools involved with that.

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, you're
just starting like a dialogue

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:45.520 align:middle line:90%
with your kidney.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Yeah.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then,
so, for you, you

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.270 align:middle line:84%
think it's an imaginary--
if you're a skeptic,

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.520 align:middle line:84%
you think it's an
imaginary conversation.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.970 align:middle line:84%
But you listen, and you
see what comes up, right?

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Exactly, yes.

00:40:56.380 --> 00:41:00.700 align:middle line:84%
We're simplifying it like crazy,
but that's essentially it.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Opening up that dialogue
takes a very important skill

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:06.620 align:middle line:84%
that everyone has, and
that's your imagination.

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: See?

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And most people think the
imagination invalidates

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.430 align:middle line:84%
everything, and
that is so not true

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:15.340 align:middle line:84%
because what comes
into your imagination

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.850 align:middle line:90%
is coming from somewhere.

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: I call the imagination
the doorway to your intuition.

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely I love it.

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe just talk about
that for one second then

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.190 align:middle line:84%
tell us about your classes
before we sign off here.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Sure.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:32.760 align:middle line:84%
As children, we
imagine like crazy.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.330 align:middle line:90%
We have imaginary friends.

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:36.300 align:middle line:90%
We play with-- we play house.

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.010 align:middle line:90%
We play whatever.

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And we have very, very active
and fertile imaginations.

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:42.630 align:middle line:84%
There isn't one
child that I've ever

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.370 align:middle line:90%
known that doesn't have that.

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And that also speaks to
the fact that children

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.680 align:middle line:90%
are highly intuitive.

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
for most people is

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:57.450 align:middle line:84%
intuition is not considered
a valid resource or--

00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: So they're shushed.

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:00.750 align:middle line:90%
They're told, stop.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:04.050 align:middle line:84%
As you grow up, you're
shamed out of it, you know?

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is, when
people become adults, either

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.620 align:middle line:84%
they hide it, or they
go head first into it.

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Or most people will hide
it and not talk about it.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.170 align:middle line:84%
In the medical field, that's
exactly what's happening.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:19.140 align:middle line:84%
When I give conferences
or I speak at conferences,

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.320 align:middle line:84%
the medical doctors who
have used their intuition

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.540 align:middle line:84%
successfully will come
up to me, and they

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:29.040 align:middle line:84%
used to have little furtive
conversations about that.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So when you learn a field,
like some health care field,

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:34.410 align:middle line:90%
you're using your left brain.

00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:37.680 align:middle line:10%
You're using your analytical
brain because you have to.

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.830 align:middle line:10%
And accidents happen and
tragedies happen when you

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:42.120 align:middle line:10%
don't.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.730 align:middle line:84%
The key to intuition
is it doesn't

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:48.100 align:middle line:84%
have to do with your
analytical brain at all.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:48.990 align:middle line:90%
It has to do it.

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:51.540 align:middle line:84%
You could say, right
brain or non-local.

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:55.110 align:middle line:84%
That's not always
natural to people.

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:57.420 align:middle line:84%
So the learning
curve, in my programs,

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.330 align:middle line:84%
for those folks who come from
that left brain perspective

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:02.760 align:middle line:90%
is to unlearn that to do this.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's such a tragedy
that in Western cultures

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:13.320 align:middle line:84%
that imagination has
been denigrated, like,

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:17.760 align:middle line:84%
just minimized, when this is the
most wonderful faculty humans

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.620 align:middle line:90%
have is an imagination.

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, it's
being fed from somewhere.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:24.010 align:middle line:90%
That information is flowing.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:25.930 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
explaining that to us.

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:26.730 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, very quickly, how can
people get involved and take

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:32.040 align:middle line:90%
classes and such?

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>COLTER: Well, I
offer two tracks.

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:37.320 align:middle line:84%
The main track is for health
care professionals-- wellness

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.020 align:middle line:84%
professionals, I should
say, from health coaches

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:43.140 align:middle line:84%
to MDs and everything
in between.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:48.690 align:middle line:10%
And that is a one year program
they can find on my website.

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:51.150 align:middle line:10%
The other part is for
everyone, and that

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:53.370 align:middle line:10%
is the idea of energy
hygiene and learning

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:54.930 align:middle line:10%
to open that communication.

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:57.390 align:middle line:84%
That program is called
medical intuition

00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:01.230 align:middle line:84%
for healing and
self-care, and that's also

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:02.617 align:middle line:90%
can be found on my website.

00:44:02.617 --> 00:44:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:04.825 align:middle line:84%
Well, Wendie, I
want to thank you

00:44:04.825 --> 00:44:07.470 align:middle line:84%
for being here with us
and also because this

00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:09.750 align:middle line:90%
needs a lot of educating.

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:12.330 align:middle line:84%
The public needs a
lot of tools to work

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:13.950 align:middle line:84%
with to help educate
their doctors,

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:16.810 align:middle line:84%
their family members, and so
forth as to the value of this.

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:18.750 align:middle line:84%
So I very much
appreciate that you're

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:20.647 align:middle line:90%
on the education trail on this.

00:44:20.647 --> 00:44:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>COLTER: Thank you.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, thank you.

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:25.740 align:middle line:84%
I personally believe
this is a profession

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.840 align:middle line:90%
whose time is long overdue.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.760 align:middle line:84%

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:42.200 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:48.000 align:middle line:90%
