at the news headlines, filled

with conflict and obscene levels
of inequity and unfairness,

John, it's good
to see you again.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.140 align:middle line:84%

of years and a lot

into your background,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.220 align:middle line:10%

with your voice,
which I just love.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:84%
I love the cartooning that went
along with it because it pretty

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.800 align:middle line:84%
much explains what you
used to do for a living.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.240 align:middle line:84%
So let's just take a moment
and roll that animation.

managed to create the world's

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:84%
first truly global empire, and
it's basically a secret empire.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.210 align:middle line:90%
We do it in many ways.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.120 align:middle line:10%
But principally, we
identify a country

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.910 align:middle line:10%
that has resources our
corporations covet, like oil,

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:10%
arrange a huge loan to that
country from the World Bank

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.345 align:middle line:10%
or one of its sisters.

00:01:40.345 --> 00:01:42.220 align:middle line:10%
The money never actually
goes to the country.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.840 align:middle line:10%
It goes to our own corporations
to build the infrastructure

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.990 align:middle line:10%
projects in that country that
help a few very wealthy people,

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.990 align:middle line:10%
but don't benefit the
majority of the people who

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.100 align:middle line:10%
are too poor to buy
electricity or have

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.950 align:middle line:10%
cars to drive on the highways.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they're left
holding a huge debt

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.630 align:middle line:90%
that they can't repay.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.269 align:middle line:84%
So we go back at some point and
say, you can't pay your debts.

00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:03.310 align:middle line:10%
Give us a pound of flesh.

jackals go in and either

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.820 align:middle line:10%
overthrow or assassinate
these leaders.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.855 align:middle line:10%
And if the jackals fail,
as they did in Iraq, then

00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:10%
we send in the military.

kind of capitalism where

a mutant viral

which I think is really a
predatory form of capitalism,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.350 align:middle line:84%

I was in business
school in Boston,

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.300 align:middle line:10%
I was recruited by the
National Security Agency,

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.684 align:middle line:10%
primarily because
my wife at the time,

00:04:04.684 --> 00:04:06.600 align:middle line:10%
her father was very high
up in the government,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.270 align:middle line:10%
and one of his best friends
was high up in the National

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.970 align:middle line:10%
Security Agency,
and I was looking

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.030 align:middle line:10%
for a way out of Vietnam.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And they put me through
a series of tests,

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.550 align:middle line:84%
including lie detector tests,
psychological tests, very, very

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.000 align:middle line:90%
extensive.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.081 align:middle line:84%
What I later learned
was that they concluded

00:04:21.081 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:84%
that I would make a good
economic hitman, a good con man

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:25.574 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:04:25.574 --> 00:04:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And I had the credentials, I was
graduating from business school

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:90%
so I had the credentials.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And they also discovered that
I had three weaknesses, which

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.500 align:middle line:84%
I think we could say are the
three big drugs of our culture,

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.840 align:middle line:90%
at least for men perhaps.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's the desire to
have power, money, and sex.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
I was a very young man
at the time, early 20s,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.810 align:middle line:90%
and I wanted all of these.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And I came from a fairly
poor rural background

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.060 align:middle line:90%
in New Hampshire.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:90%
And so this all appealed to me.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.580 align:middle line:84%
But then, they also encouraged
me to go in the Peace Corps.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.220 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.230 align:middle line:84%
For three years, I was in South
America working in the Amazon

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.520 align:middle line:84%
and the Andes, primarily
with indigenous people.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Once I was in the
Peace Corps, I was

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.350 align:middle line:84%
contacted by a man who later
became my boss at a consulting

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.960 align:middle line:84%
firm who was closely affiliated
with the National Security

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.465 align:middle line:84%
Agency through the Army Reserve,
which he was very high up

00:05:17.465 --> 00:05:19.650 align:middle line:90%
in as an intelligence officer.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And he came down to Ecuador,
where I was, and contacted me.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.996 align:middle line:84%
And basically offered
me a job when I got out

00:05:25.996 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:84%
of the Peace Corps, but
part of the condition

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.310 align:middle line:84%
was that I would
send back reports

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.890 align:middle line:84%
from Ecuador about economic
things going on, what

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.380 align:middle line:84%
was going on in South
America at the time.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.950 align:middle line:84%
What I saw with the
indigenous movements.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.950 align:middle line:84%
It was during the Cold
War, and so the US

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.450 align:middle line:84%
had a great interest
in knowing what

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:84%
was happening in some of
the revolutionary type

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.950 align:middle line:84%
movements that were
growing in Latin America,

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and he asked me to
send reports on that.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.380 align:middle line:90%
And I was happy to do it.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.590 align:middle line:84%
I had been an English
major, I loved writing,

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.205 align:middle line:84%
so I kind of wrote
these flowing reports

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.420 align:middle line:84%
But I was giving him
good information too.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And then when I got
out of the Peace Corps,

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.950 align:middle line:84%
they offered me a job as an

with the National Security

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.717 align:middle line:84%

put into training

00:06:25.717 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:84%
to become, what we
call tongue-in-cheek,

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.420 align:middle line:90%
an economic hitman.

My title was Economist,
and very quickly I

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.316 align:middle line:84%
was promoted to

00:06:36.316 --> 00:06:37.500 align:middle line:90%
had a staff working for me.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.410 align:middle line:84%
But basically, my
job was a con man.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.640 align:middle line:84%

covet, like oil, to accept

huge loans from the World Bank
and its sister organizations.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.920 align:middle line:84%
But the money would never
actually go to the country.

by the World Bank

to hire our corporations
to build big infrastructure

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.320 align:middle line:90%
projects in those countries.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Things like power plants
and industrial parks that,

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:84%
of course, benefited
our corporations most.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And also benefited a few wealthy
families in those countries.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.020 align:middle line:84%
The families that owned the
industries and the banks and so

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:90%
forth that used the electricity.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.039 align:middle line:84%
And the highways, and the
airports, and the ports.

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:25.080 align:middle line:84%
But the majority of the
people in these countries

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.670 align:middle line:90%
didn't benefit at all.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.770 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have enough
money to buy electricity.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.511 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: And they didn't
get jobs in industrial parks

00:07:31.511 --> 00:07:33.050 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
hire many people.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they were left
holding this huge debt

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.417 align:middle line:84%
that they couldn't
possibly repay.

00:07:37.417 --> 00:07:39.791 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that really gets
into the story of Ecuador.

00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Your life has
become inextricably

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.830 align:middle line:84%
intertwined with Ecuador
throughout the decade.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And yet in the early
days, did you see yourself

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.330 align:middle line:84%
as doing something
untoward in any way?

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Or did you think this is just
a good job opportunity that

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:84%
would satisfy your
other needs of life?

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: Well, you know,
Regina, it's interesting.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:04.350 align:middle line:84%
When I went to Ecuador as a
Peace Corps volunteer in 1968,

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:84%
the country was run by a
military dictatorship that

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.560 align:middle line:84%
had been put into power and
kept there by us, by the CIA,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.880 align:middle line:90%
by our people.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And Texaco had just discovered
that Ecuador had a lot of oil,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
exactly how much.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.326 align:middle line:10%
But the news went
out that this oil

00:08:23.326 --> 00:08:25.200 align:middle line:10%
would be the means for
Ecuador to come up out

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.464 align:middle line:10%
of the Dark Ages.

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You believed that?

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.985 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: I believed
it, too, because I

00:08:28.985 --> 00:08:30.651 align:middle line:84%
had been taught that
in business school.

00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:33.679 align:middle line:84%
That that's what happens
when countries get oil,

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and then they can use that oil
as collateral, which Ecuador

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.480 align:middle line:84%
did with these dictators,
or this military junta.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And use the oil that was still
in the ground as collateral

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.120 align:middle line:84%
to get these huge loans
from the World Bank, which

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle line:84%
economic hitmen were
in there pushing for.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.660 align:middle line:84%
But the money was used
to hire our corporations

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.000 align:middle line:84%
to build the infrastructure
projects there.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And to help a few
wealthy people in Ecuador

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.670 align:middle line:90%
get more and more wealthy.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't see all
that at the time.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.770 align:middle line:84%
I thought that,
yes, oil was going

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.537 align:middle line:90%
to be used to help education.

00:09:04.537 --> 00:09:05.495 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Makes sense.

00:09:05.495 --> 00:09:06.240 align:middle line:90%
You were young.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Yeah.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.763 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what we were
taught in business school too.

00:09:08.763 --> 00:09:09.690 align:middle line:90%
And we still are.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.010 align:middle line:90%
That is still the model.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what's
the reality of what

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.220 align:middle line:84%
happened in Ecuador coming
right up to current times?

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: Well, the
reality is that Texaco

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:90%
went in and raped the country.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.675 align:middle line:84%
And they just lost a
huge lawsuit, Texaco did,

00:09:22.675 --> 00:09:24.560 align:middle line:84%
which is now owned
by Chevron, so it

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.390 align:middle line:84%
was a lawsuit on behalf of
30,000 Ecuadorian Amazonian

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:84%
people against Chevron-Texaco,
because the terrible pollution.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.300 align:middle line:90%
People dying of toxic waste.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Texaco--

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
amount of dumping.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I read that a couple years
ago in your last book,

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:90%
"Hoodwinked."

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.480 align:middle line:90%
Horrible.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: You go into the
northern Amazon and Ecuador,

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's just a huge
mass of toxic waste.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's no drinking
water, no potable water.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:54.630 align:middle line:90%
People are still dying.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:90%
It's still a crime going on.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And Texaco lost the lawsuit,
but they're refusing to pay.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.274 align:middle line:90%
And Chevron also.

00:10:01.274 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:84%
They say they have
no assets in Ecuador,

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.482 align:middle line:90%
so Ecuador has no recourse.

00:10:05.482 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there was
also some debt involved

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.380 align:middle line:84%
and Correa said
we're not paying.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.150 align:middle line:84%
What happened around that, maybe
set that up a little bit for us

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.680 align:middle line:90%
so we see what happens.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: Well, President
Correa of Ecuador

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.900 align:middle line:84%
has a PhD in economics from
the University of Illinois.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.980 align:middle line:90%
He's a capitalist.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.930 align:middle line:90%
He understands our system.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And he ran on a
ticket that said,

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get for my people
of Ecuador what they deserve.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.277 align:middle line:84%
So he said, realistically,
we need oil companies.

00:10:33.277 --> 00:10:35.610 align:middle line:84%
We need technology because
we don't have the technology.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.220 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to make sure
that these companies take care

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:84%
of the environment, that
they do a really good job,

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and they're very restricted
in certain areas,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and the people of
Ecuador get a fair share

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:84%
of the proceeds that
come from our own oil.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And he was very popular and
got elected by a big majority,

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.750 align:middle line:84%
and many of us
supported him strongly.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.160 align:middle line:90%
He's since changed.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.350 align:middle line:90%
He's made a lot of compromises.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think, to be
honest with you,

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:06.170 align:middle line:84%
what happened was he got read
the riot act, like so many.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, a couple
years ago, the president

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:15.170 align:middle line:84%
of Honduras, President Zelaya,
got overthrown in a CIA coup

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.660 align:middle line:84%
because he stood up to Dole
and Chiquita, Russell Athletic,

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.380 align:middle line:84%
a few other big
multinational corporations.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.120 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to increase the
minimum wage significantly

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.495 align:middle line:84%
and have land
reform, which would

00:11:25.495 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:84%
have impacted those
countries big time.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're talking about
wages of as little as 6.5 cents

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.770 align:middle line:90%
an hour.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.524 align:middle line:90%
I mean, reform was needed.

00:11:34.524 --> 00:11:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Yeah.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
one of the lowest wage

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.537 align:middle line:90%
rates in the hemisphere.

00:11:38.537 --> 00:11:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: So Haiti and
Honduras are about the lowest.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happened
to Aristide in Haiti.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:84%
When both of these men,
Aristide and Zelaya,

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:55.347 align:middle line:84%
threatened to increase the wage
rate by 60% percent or more--

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From what?

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.555 align:middle line:90%
6.5 cents to a dime an hour?

00:11:58.555 --> 00:11:59.555 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Yeah, I know.

00:11:59.555 --> 00:12:00.780 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.380 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is not
only do the companies that

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:07.230 align:middle line:84%
are working in those countries
object because they're

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:84%
going to have to pay more to
laborers in those countries,

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.120 align:middle line:84%
but basically every major
corporation that's working

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.610 align:middle line:84%
in Latin America objects because
they know that nobody is going

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.300 align:middle line:90%
to go below Honduras or Haiti.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So if they raise
their wage rates,

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.699 align:middle line:84%
it means El Salvador
and Colombia and Ecuador

00:12:24.699 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:84%
and every other country is
going to to raise their wage

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:28.365 align:middle line:84%
rates, too, because
they all want

00:12:28.365 --> 00:12:30.320 align:middle line:84%
to stay at the same
level on the ladder.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And so Zelaya was
overthrown in a CIA coup,

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.285 align:middle line:84%
replaced by a brutal,
terrible totalitarian dictator

00:12:36.285 --> 00:12:40.300 align:middle line:84%
who has just driven Honduras
into a police state.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, Correa
was watching this.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a coup
launched against Correa.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.200 align:middle line:84%
He was really standing up to
oil companies and gold mining

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.625 align:middle line:84%
and other international
companies.

00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:53.870 align:middle line:84%
There was a coup
launched against him.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:55.340 align:middle line:90%
It was unsuccessful.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it was
meant to be unsuccessful,

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:03.240 align:middle line:84%
because the leader of the coup
was the Commandant of Police.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And he was trained in the
School of the Americas,

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.030 align:middle line:90%
he was part of the CIA circle.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.850 align:middle line:84%
But coups in Latin
America are not successful

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.610 align:middle line:84%
unless you get the
military behind them.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.779 align:middle line:84%
The military stood
behind Correa.

00:13:15.779 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do think it was just
to frighten him and intimidate

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:18.740 align:middle line:90%
him?

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.156 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: I totally
believe that,

00:13:20.156 --> 00:13:23.360 align:middle line:84%
because the CIA knows that
the Commandant of Police

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.850 align:middle line:84%
is not going to be successful
unless the military comes in.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.869 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So he's diminished.

00:13:27.869 --> 00:13:28.993 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: He's diminished.

00:13:28.993 --> 00:13:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I have
to say in his defense--

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.391 align:middle line:84%
as I would say in the defense
of so many of these presidents,

00:13:33.391 --> 00:13:35.910 align:middle line:84%
including our own,
Obama-- that when

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.760 align:middle line:84%
you start to look at these
things, a guy like Correa

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.650 align:middle line:84%
has to say to himself,
you know, if they

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.960 align:middle line:84%
overthrow me or assassinate
me, my successor

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.520 align:middle line:90%
is going to be a total puppet.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.925 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
set a precedent

00:13:48.925 --> 00:13:49.883 align:middle line:90%
all over Latin America.

00:13:49.883 --> 00:13:52.540 align:middle line:84%
It's going to scare every
other president that

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.680 align:middle line:90%
tries to stand up to the system.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And so my challenge, the
most important thing I can do

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.790 align:middle line:84%
is stay in office and
compromise the way I have to,

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.540 align:middle line:84%
but focus on the things where
I think I can-- the battles

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.683 align:middle line:90%
that I can win.

00:14:06.683 --> 00:14:08.165 align:middle line:90%
Focus on those.

00:14:08.165 --> 00:14:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if you look
at it on the macro scale,

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.910 align:middle line:90%
who doesn't do that?

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:84%
People are faced in their lives
with these kinds of decisions.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:17.900 align:middle line:84%
We just put a lot
of importance on it,

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:84%
of course, when it
affects global events

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.159 align:middle line:90%
and global economies.

00:14:21.159 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is,
if you're looking

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.890 align:middle line:84%
at it on a scale
of consciousness,

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:84%
people are forced
into these positions

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.180 align:middle line:84%
kind of on a niggling
day-to-day basis almost,

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:90%
this kind of compromise in life.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And in his case,
you're talking--

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and the leaders of
the world-- you're

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.980 align:middle line:84%
talking about a price
that's very hefty.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.010 align:middle line:84%
It might be the lives
of their family members

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.850 align:middle line:84%
or their own lives, or
character assassination.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.064 align:middle line:84%
And since we're on that, I know
you have some new work going

00:14:48.064 --> 00:14:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and you're writing a
new book right now.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And you're really
delving into the kinds

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.200 align:middle line:84%
of pressure and vulnerability
of the leaders of the world.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.540 align:middle line:84%
So let's take another
country as an example.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to the 1950s and
the US and Iran and President

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:05.580 align:middle line:90%
Eisenhower.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And then carry that
Iranian situation forward

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:11.290 align:middle line:84%
to the headlines that are in
the paper today, more sanctions.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:12.090 align:middle line:90%
My god.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Decade after decade, it's
the same old wheel of events.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Well, yes.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:24.370 align:middle line:84%
So back in the early '50s,
Iran had democratic elections,

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:28.470 align:middle line:84%
which was pretty amazing
in and of itself, elected

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.420 align:middle line:90%
Prime Minister Mosaddegh.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And Mosaddegh had run on,
again, a policy quite similar

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:84%
to Correa's
Ecuadorian elections.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.380 align:middle line:84%
It said basically, we understand
that the international oil

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:84%
companies need to be
here, but our people

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:90%
need to get a fair share.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And these companies have
to behave responsibly

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.380 align:middle line:90%
environmentally and socially.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And once he was
elected, he began

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:84%
to impose some very
strict regulations

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.150 align:middle line:90%
to make that happen.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, we
and England, what's

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.340 align:middle line:84%
today British Petroleum was very
active in Iran in those days,

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.690 align:middle line:84%
were incensed over
this and decided

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.150 align:middle line:84%
that we had to do
something about it.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Which I think in retrospect
is extremely unfortunate.

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Because if we'd
supported him and said,

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:84%
yes, let's help the Iranian
people benefit more,

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.320 align:middle line:84%
that would've changed the whole
history of the Middle East.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we would have
anything near the problems

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.380 align:middle line:84%
we have all over the
Middle East today

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.160 align:middle line:90%
if we'd just supported that man.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.710 align:middle line:84%
But instead, we
decided he had to go.

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower-- well, first of all,
Truman wouldn't buy into it.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.880 align:middle line:84%
But he was about
to leave office.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:84%
When Eisenhower
came into office,

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.900 align:middle line:84%
the Dulles brothers ran the
CIA and the State Department.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.776 align:middle line:84%
They were very strongly
opposed to Mosaddegh.

00:16:41.776 --> 00:16:43.400 align:middle line:84%
They called him a
socialist and that he

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.620 align:middle line:84%
would be in the Russian
camp, and the Cold War

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.020 align:middle line:90%
was on strong then.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.030 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't want
to send in the troops

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.696 align:middle line:84%
because Russia had
nuclear weapons,

00:16:51.696 --> 00:16:52.820 align:middle line:90%
and we had nuclear weapons.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And they were afraid
that Russia would

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:57.637 align:middle line:84%
enter the war on the side of
Iran and use nuclear weapons.

00:16:57.637 --> 00:16:59.345 align:middle line:84%
So they came up with
this plan of sending

00:16:59.345 --> 00:17:02.710 align:middle line:84%
in a CIA agent,
Kermit Roosevelt,

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:90%
grandson of Teddy Roosevelt.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And Kermit went in with a
few hundred million dollars,

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.990 align:middle line:90%
some large amount of money.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:15.359 align:middle line:84%
Not that large, not as large as
the military would have cost.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And he managed to
foment protests.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.849 align:middle line:84%
He paid a lot of people to go
out on the streets and protest.

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And he made it look as though
Mosaddegh was very unpopular.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:90%
And he instituted a coup.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And so Mosaddegh was
put under house arrest

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and the CIA brought
the Shah of Iran in.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And we all know that the
Shah became a great friend

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
of the oil companies and
all American corporations.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.360 align:middle line:84%
I've spent many-- over
a period of 10 years,

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.410 align:middle line:84%
I probably spent a couple
of years in Iran developing

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:84%
projects that were helping
us more than anybody else,

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.230 align:middle line:90%
and a few of the Shah's cronies.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And so it was such a
successful experiment though,

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:02.290 align:middle line:84%
using this economic
hitman, Roosevelt,

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:06.090 align:middle line:84%
that it sent a
strong message out

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.800 align:middle line:84%
to the State Department and
the presidency and the UN,

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.090 align:middle line:84%
and what I call
the corporatocracy,

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.790 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't need to
take the risk of war

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.510 align:middle line:90%
or the tremendous expense.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:84%
We could accomplish
the same thing

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:22.260 align:middle line:84%
by sending an individual
in with some money

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:84%
to bring around presidents
in one way or another.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.510 align:middle line:84%
The only problem
was that Roosevelt

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.890 align:middle line:90%
was a card-carrying CIA agent.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.122 align:middle line:84%
And if he'd been
caught, there would

00:18:32.122 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:84%
have been egg on the face
of the US government.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:34.746 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:35.800 align:middle line:90%
It could have looked bad.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.758 align:middle line:90%
It could've looked bad.

00:18:36.758 --> 00:18:42.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, so at the same time, this
was also in the early '50s,

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.170 align:middle line:84%
there was a nuclear
agreement that

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.350 align:middle line:84%
had been signed between
the United States and Iran,

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.260 align:middle line:84%
if I understand it
correctly, and it

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.691 align:middle line:90%
was called Atoms For Peace.

00:18:51.691 --> 00:18:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Mm-hmm.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And here we
are now 60 years later,

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:02.060 align:middle line:84%
and now we're back to this
whole notion of Atoms For Peace

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.900 align:middle line:84%
being used for military
weaponization and all the fears

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.480 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.150 align:middle line:90%
What happened then?

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.840 align:middle line:90%
What went wrong with that?

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.840 align:middle line:84%
We've been alternately
friends, enemies, friends,

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.970 align:middle line:90%
we're frenemies.

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:14.654 align:middle line:90%
Now I guess enemies, right?

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Well, yeah.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's going on there?

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.991 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: It's a
terrible shame, you know,

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:20.040 align:middle line:90%
what happened with Iran.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:25.040 align:middle line:84%
So once we overthrew Mosaddegh
and replaced him with the Shah,

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.440 align:middle line:84%
there was tremendous
undercurrent of resentment.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Not just in Iran, but
all over the Middle East.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.230 align:middle line:90%
In fact, the world.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And it caused what we
call blowback eventually.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And this resulted in the Mullahs
taking over and overthrowing

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.410 align:middle line:90%
the Shah years later.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:10%
But this resentment that
bubbled up-- and now,

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.570 align:middle line:10%
today, we're in the situation
where we're fearful of Iran.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle line:10%
Iran controls a lot of oil.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.050 align:middle line:10%
Iran controls the
Straits of Hormuz,

00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:00.840 align:middle line:10%
where something like 20%
or more of the world's oil

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.440 align:middle line:10%
passes through these straits.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:10%
Now there's a military base
down on the Straits of Hormuz

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.900 align:middle line:10%
at a town called Bandar
Abbas, which I financed.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.892 align:middle line:90%
I arranged for that.

00:20:08.892 --> 00:20:09.600 align:middle line:90%
I was down there.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I spent a lot of
time in Bandar Abbas.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the hottest places
on the planet, you know.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.970 align:middle line:84%
So we were developing this
military base down there

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.900 align:middle line:84%
for the Shah, but
basically for ourselves.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we thought, we, then,
the United States military,

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.313 align:middle line:84%
would have control of
the Straits of Hormuz.

00:20:24.313 --> 00:20:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Of course today, it's in
the hands of the Mullahs

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.220 align:middle line:84%
and they're using
it as leverage.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that the real
problem that we have with Iran

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:34.820 align:middle line:84%
has anything to do
with nuclear weapons.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.980 align:middle line:84%
It has everything
to do with the fact

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.307 align:middle line:84%
that Iran is
threatening to sell oil

00:20:39.307 --> 00:20:41.265 align:middle line:84%
on the international
market for something other

00:20:41.265 --> 00:20:44.105 align:middle line:84%
than dollars, open what they
call an International Oil

00:20:44.105 --> 00:20:44.605 align:middle line:90%
Bourse.

>>PERKINS: Well, Qaddafi
threatened to do this.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Saddam Hussein
threatened to do this.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.710 align:middle line:90%
Chavez threatened to do this.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And every one of them was
taken down in the process.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:90%
Chavez wasn't, he resisted.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.770 align:middle line:84%
He overcame the
CIA coup in 2002,

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:04.521 align:middle line:84%
but he'd dropped away from this
idea of an International Oil

00:21:04.521 --> 00:21:05.020 align:middle line:90%
Bourse.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.630 align:middle line:90%
So he, too, compromised a bit.

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.220 align:middle line:84%
But both Qaddafi and Saddam
Hussein, neither one of them

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:09.720 align:middle line:90%
backed down.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.980 align:middle line:90%
They were taken out.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:84%
I think this is really
the biggest thing that's

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.050 align:middle line:84%
behind what's happening
in Iran today.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:20.520 align:middle line:84%
You've got to figure Iran is
surrounded by nuclear weapons.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.144 align:middle line:90%
Russia.

Israel.

00:21:28.472 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:84%
It's surrounded by
nuclear weapons.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.550 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
General Custer telling

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.230 align:middle line:84%
the Indians they
couldn't have guns.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.040 align:middle line:84%
We can have guns, but
they can't have guns.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.940 align:middle line:84%
If you were Iranian, you'd say
why the heck shouldn't we have

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.300 align:middle line:90%
what all of our neighbors have?

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.425 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and they're
just insisting no, it's

00:21:43.425 --> 00:21:45.946 align:middle line:84%
for peaceful purposes, for
energy production and so forth.

00:21:45.946 --> 00:21:47.320 align:middle line:84%
But in reality,
why wouldn't they

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:84%
want to be protecting
themselves?

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.898 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: That's true.

00:21:49.898 --> 00:21:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the evidence does
show that they may not

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.575 align:middle line:84%
be developing nuclear
weapons, that it

00:21:54.575 --> 00:21:56.470 align:middle line:90%
is for peaceful purposes.

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.580 align:middle line:84%
The point being,
however, I don't

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.284 align:middle line:84%
think the whole
nuclear issue has much

00:22:02.284 --> 00:22:04.450 align:middle line:84%
to do with what's going on
between the United States

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:04.990 align:middle line:90%
and Iran.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.920 align:middle line:84%
It has much more to do with the
dollar and the central banking

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:09.420 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.336 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Petrodollar.

00:22:10.336 --> 00:22:12.690 align:middle line:10%
>>PERKINS: Petrodollar, central
banking system, and oil.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:13.880 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, now
that's interesting,

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.421 align:middle line:10%
because there was
some thought a year

00:22:15.421 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:10%
or two ago when we
were speaking last

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:10%
that they might switch over
to a petroeuro, for example.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Now look at everything
that's going on in the EU.

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it can't all
be one big conspiracy,

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.540 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think
they're that well organized

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.370 align:middle line:90%
on certain levels.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:35.810 align:middle line:84%
But isn't it interesting no
matter which way you slice it,

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:41.140 align:middle line:84%
it keeps shunting back
to the preservation

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.380 align:middle line:90%
of this petrodollar.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Right.

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:43.729 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:22:43.729 --> 00:22:47.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not what I would call
a conspiracy theorist.

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what goes on.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:52.980 align:middle line:84%
But I have no reason from
personal experience--

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.270 align:middle line:84%
which is what I base everything
on, I speculate much--

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:59.930 align:middle line:84%
and I've never been in contact
with the one person who

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:04.170 align:middle line:84%
sits at the top,
the Oz up there.

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:08.740 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of the matter
is that our whole system

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.450 align:middle line:84%
is driven by what I call
predatory capitalism, which

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:12.450 align:middle line:90%
is a fairly new thing.

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:13.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not what I was
taught in business school.

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:16.328 align:middle line:84%
It came along in the '70s when
Milton Friedman, the Chicago

00:23:16.328 --> 00:23:19.475 align:middle line:84%
School of Economics, said, "The
only responsibility of business

00:23:19.475 --> 00:23:21.550 align:middle line:84%
is to maximize
profits regardless

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:23.220 align:middle line:84%
of the social and
environmental cost."

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.330 align:middle line:84%
That's not what I was
taught in business school.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.130 align:middle line:84%
I was taught you have
to take into account

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:28.860 align:middle line:84%
the social and
environmental costs,

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and that has to be
a big part of it.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.250 align:middle line:90%
But that all changed.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And so everything is driven
by that now, and especially

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:90%
with the oil companies.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And the oil companies
are extremely powerful.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't think any of us has
a real appreciation for how

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.520 align:middle line:84%
powerful they are, because it's
really not just about them.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.517 align:middle line:84%
They don't even have to lobby
that much because everybody

00:23:49.517 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:90%
else is dependent on them.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:55.130 align:middle line:84%
The pharmaceutical industry
is dependent on oil.

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:57.634 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is dependent on oil.

00:23:57.634 --> 00:23:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All manufacturing.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.008 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: All manufacturing.

00:24:00.008 --> 00:24:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Food that's wrapped in
plastic, that's oil.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So when big oil is threatened,
when we think the price of oil

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:11.250 align:middle line:84%
might go up, everybody gets
on the bandwagon and objects

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.240 align:middle line:90%
to this.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So oil has tremendous,
tremendous power.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the whole-- what I
call the corporatocracy, which

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.870 align:middle line:84%
really are the people
that are running the world

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:25.590 align:middle line:84%
today, the biggest leaders of
our multinational corporations.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And again, they don't
have to get together

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.900 align:middle line:84%
to conspire to do something
illegal, a conspiracy.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.400 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know each other
half of them, I don't think.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.930 align:middle line:84%
But they do all follow
the same guideline,

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:38.766 align:middle line:84%
which is maximize
profits regardless

00:24:38.766 --> 00:24:40.140 align:middle line:84%
of social and
environmental cost.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And whenever that's threatened,
they all come together.

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:47.080 align:middle line:84%
So Shell and Chevron may be
competing for your dollar

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.380 align:middle line:84%
at the gas station,
and Nike and Reebok

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.780 align:middle line:84%
may be competing for your
dollar in the stores,

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.390 align:middle line:84%
but if they're threatened in
any way by new regulations

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:56.469 align:middle line:90%
they all come together.

00:24:56.469 --> 00:24:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they come together
also in the form of lobbying

00:24:59.010 --> 00:24:59.800 align:middle line:90%
on Capitol Hill--

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: And that's
how they come together.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -in this country, and
elsewhere in the world, just

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:03.940 align:middle line:90%

>>PERKINS: Absolutely.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And if it involves
another country,

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:12.070 align:middle line:84%
they put tremendous pressure
on the US government, the CIA,

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:13.730 align:middle line:84%
the Pentagon to
stand behind them.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:17.100 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I would go so far as
to say that these institutions

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.940 align:middle line:84%
today, the Pentagon,
the CIA, essentially

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.350 align:middle line:84%
serve the interests
of big corporations.

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.500 align:middle line:84%
They're not serving the--
they're not serving me,

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.000 align:middle line:84%
they're not serving
you, they're not

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:84%
serving the interests
of the American people.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's so
archaic on one level

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.060 align:middle line:84%
when you look at it, just
again, tying everything

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.080 align:middle line:90%
to oil supplies globally.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.822 align:middle line:84%
And here we're sitting
on the precipice,

00:25:38.822 --> 00:25:41.280 align:middle line:84%
and have been for quite a long
time, of so many alternative

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.230 align:middle line:90%
energies.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Literally on the precipice of
cold fusion it sounds like.

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And yet, still you read
the headlines in the paper

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:52.720 align:middle line:84%

now threatening sanctions,

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.830 align:middle line:84%
or I guess have
imposed sanctions

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.740 align:middle line:84%
on countries that are
accepting oil and continuing

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.810 align:middle line:84%
to buy from Iran
because of Iran's

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.290 align:middle line:90%
supposed "nuclear program."

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:07.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean this sounds like
1970s, 1980s, 1990s.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.680 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't change, the
story doesn't change.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.930 align:middle line:84%

it has really begun to change,

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:14.650 align:middle line:90%
but nothing's changing.

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: Create a bad guy
You know, have somebody to-- we

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.430 align:middle line:84%
talk about global

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:84%
of Evil, which Iran is
theoretically part of.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.440 align:middle line:84%
But in my opinion, there's no
such thing as global terrorism.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.710 align:middle line:84%
There are acts of
terror, but an "ism"

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:34.310 align:middle line:90%
implies a common philosophy.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So we know what communism
is, we know what socialism

is, we know what Catholicism
is, we know what capitalism is,

we can-- those are "isms,"
they have a common thread.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.590 align:middle line:84%
But I've talked with,
I've interviewed members

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:52.970 align:middle line:84%
of FARC in Colombia and Somali
pirates and members of al-Qaeda

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.510 align:middle line:84%
and the Taliban, and they
don't have anything in common.

is that their rank and
file are desperate people.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.390 align:middle line:84%
because their waters had
been fished clean illegally

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:28.350 align:middle line:84%
by international fishing fleets,
and also the dumping of US

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:29.790 align:middle line:84%
military vessels
in their waters,

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:31.210 align:middle line:90%
which had polluted the waters.

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:34.290 align:middle line:10%
And they complained for 22
years to the United Nations,

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.840 align:middle line:10%
nobody did anything, and
their kids are starving.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And once, you know,
all you've got

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:42.940 align:middle line:84%
to be is a 16-year-olod
boy on a fishing boat

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.514 align:middle line:84%
that a couple of people on the
boat didn't catch any fish,

00:27:45.514 --> 00:27:46.430 align:middle line:90%
our kids are starving.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:49.420 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go over and
raid that ship over there

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:50.440 align:middle line:90%
and get some food.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And you're a 16-year-old
kid, you've never even picked

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:54.410 align:middle line:84%
up a gun, but suddenly
you're a pirate.

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.743 align:middle line:84%
And so now, you might as well
go ahead and pick up a gun

00:27:56.743 --> 00:27:59.217 align:middle line:84%
and become a pirate,
because you are a pirate.

00:27:59.217 --> 00:28:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
can't see a solution

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.310 align:middle line:90%
any other way at this point.

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: You don't have--
there is no other solution.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And the world's created this,
we've created that situation.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And so this idea that
there's global terrorism,

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:15.550 align:middle line:84%
it gets us all
incensed and it allows

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.570 align:middle line:84%
us to use our tax dollars to
build the military up and up

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.375 align:middle line:84%
and up and up, but
it's a false issue.

00:28:21.375 --> 00:28:22.720 align:middle line:90%
There was communism.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.240 align:middle line:84%
There was the Cold War between
capitalism and communism,

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.350 align:middle line:84%
or however you
want to define it.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.377 align:middle line:84%
And we've tried basically
to recreate that today

00:28:30.377 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:90%
and say that's global terrorism.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:34.240 align:middle line:84%
There is no such thing
as global terrorism.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.110 align:middle line:90%
Acts of terror, yes.

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:36.760 align:middle line:84%
But if we want to
get rid of those,

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.630 align:middle line:90%
we get rid of the causes.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:41.760 align:middle line:84%
We get rid of the desperation,
the poverty, the disease.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Half the world is
starving to death,

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:47.310 align:middle line:84%
or on the verge of
starvation, while less than 5%

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.900 align:middle line:84%
of the world's population of
us here in the United States

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.440 align:middle line:84%
consumes almost 30% of
the world's resources.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.530 align:middle line:90%
That's a failed economic system.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:56.862 align:middle line:90%
It's not a model.

00:28:56.862 --> 00:28:57.820 align:middle line:90%
China cannot repeat it.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not a model.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: No, it's not.

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:00.030 align:middle line:90%
China can't repeat it.

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.040 align:middle line:90%
India can't repeat it.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.290 align:middle line:90%
Latin America can't repeat it.

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:84%
They may want to,
but they can't.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:04.760 align:middle line:90%
The numbers don't add up.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.940 align:middle line:84%
5% consuming 30% of
the world's resources.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.460 align:middle line:84%
You can't take
that anywhere else.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, you can't.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And you just brought up
the subject of fairness,

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.480 align:middle line:84%
and I recently interviewed
Lynne McTaggart

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and she was talking about in
her book, "The Bond," talking

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.460 align:middle line:84%
about these really
fundamentals of life.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest
ones was this innate sense

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:24.700 align:middle line:90%
in human beings of what is fair.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And when people are
treated unfairly,

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.610 align:middle line:84%
it does bring out the
less generous in oneself.

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're a kind
and generous individual,

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.730 align:middle line:84%
if you're confronted with
feeling taken advantage of,

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:40.610 align:middle line:84%
your internal psyche
starts changing,

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:42.150 align:middle line:84%
then your behavior
starts changing.

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:44.330 align:middle line:84%
There are plenty of
experiments on this.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So why should we
assume there would

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.850 align:middle line:84%
be anything but devastation
when you're talking about people

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.900 align:middle line:84%
who've been essentially
starved out.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Right.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
created a philosophy

00:29:55.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:middle line:84%
that's pretty global now
of scarcity and limitation.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And so if I want more, I've got
to take it from somebody else.

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of
the Age of Aquarius,

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.630 align:middle line:84%
part of all the prophecies,
2012, the eagle and the condor,

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:13.880 align:middle line:84%
prophecies around the
world are telling us

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.032 align:middle line:84%
that we're not living in a
time of scarcity or limitation.

00:30:17.032 --> 00:30:18.740 align:middle line:84%
We need to move out
of that and recognize

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.120 align:middle line:90%
that there's abundance.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.760 align:middle line:84%
For example, this
idea of peak oil.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.172 align:middle line:90%
Well, I hope there is peak oil.

00:30:24.172 --> 00:30:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I hope that it happens
soon and then we'd

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.350 align:middle line:84%
really turn to the
sun because we know--

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's all there.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: -there's
plenty of energy.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.787 align:middle line:90%
There's no scarcity of energy.

00:30:31.787 --> 00:30:32.204 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:30:32.204 --> 00:30:32.621 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: There's an abundance.

00:30:32.621 --> 00:30:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No scarcity of energy.

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:36.856 align:middle line:84%
We know that, and you
can look at it probably

00:30:36.856 --> 00:30:38.730 align:middle line:84%
1,000 different ways,
and each of those ways,

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.780 align:middle line:84%
there's still no
scarcity of energy.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:41.660 align:middle line:90%
So that's a lie.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:42.260 align:middle line:90%
That's a lie.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:46.480 align:middle line:10%
And all of these manipulations
taking place in the daily news

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.450 align:middle line:10%
are simply
perpetuated to keep us

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:51.560 align:middle line:10%
in that fear
scenario of scarcity.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Because how can you rally
people, semi-educated people

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:58.920 align:middle line:84%
if you call watching the
evening news educated,

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.550 align:middle line:84%
how can you rally them
without fear at the basis?

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.346 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Right.

00:31:04.346 --> 00:31:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And speaking of the
news, it's at best

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:10.360 align:middle line:84%
entertainment, and at
worst just pure propaganda.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And it is feeding us this
line of scarcity and so forth.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:16.685 align:middle line:10%
And when you think
that less than 5%

00:31:16.685 --> 00:31:18.200 align:middle line:10%
of us living in
the United States

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.091 align:middle line:10%
consumes 30% of the world's
resources, there's no scarcity.

00:31:21.091 --> 00:31:22.340 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's unconscionable.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.830 align:middle line:10%
>>PERKINS: And then we
talk about of that 5%,

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:28.410 align:middle line:10%
it's 1% we say,
the 99% versus 1%,

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.190 align:middle line:10%
but the fact is it's
much less than 1%.

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:32.390 align:middle line:90%
I did the calculations.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:36.530 align:middle line:84%
400 individuals in this
country control more assets

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:40.260 align:middle line:84%
than 50% of the population
of the United States.

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.070 align:middle line:90%
400 individuals.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:47.240 align:middle line:90%
I did the math it's 0.0000035%.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.414 align:middle line:90%
It's way less than 1%.

00:31:49.414 --> 00:31:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And so, when you start to
look at numbers like that,

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.150 align:middle line:84%
you realize it's not a
question of scarcity.

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:56.345 align:middle line:90%
It's a question of justice.

00:31:56.345 --> 00:31:58.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a question of balance
and distribution of resources.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.594 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:59.594 --> 00:32:02.080 align:middle line:84%
So we get that
mindset has to change.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:07.860 align:middle line:84%
But you have to go
some lengths to find

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.580 align:middle line:90%
any kind of genuine information.

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:12.000 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to
decipher what's going on

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.490 align:middle line:84%
because of flat out
disinformation and propaganda

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:16.940 align:middle line:90%
that is the media of the worlds.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the other media,
it's not just America,

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.820 align:middle line:84%
haven fallen into the same
trap to a very large extent.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.250 align:middle line:84%
There are a few good agencies
operating on their own

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:24.750 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.220 align:middle line:84%
But, for the most part, it's
a pretty corrupt business.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.500 align:middle line:90%
It's infotainment, as you say.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk
about how that feeds

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:35.450 align:middle line:84%
into the lives of and the
election-- the election

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:38.560 align:middle line:84%
process, but also the
lives of the world leaders.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Because of this new work
you're doing right now

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and we have this
election looming.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Now it's down to
Romney and Obama.

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:48.600 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what you're
discovering in your research.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: It's interesting that
the book that I'm writing now

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.810 align:middle line:84%
is fiction, it's a
novel, because when

00:32:56.810 --> 00:33:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I write nonfiction, I make
sure that I have everything

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.750 align:middle line:90%
backed up that I have filed.

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:04.210 align:middle line:10%
And after "Confessions of an
Economic Hit Man" came out,

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:08.360 align:middle line:10%
several major organizations and
corporations tried to sue me.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.645 align:middle line:10%
And we had all the backup files
and sent them the information

00:33:11.645 --> 00:33:13.990 align:middle line:10%
and they went away.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:17.720 align:middle line:84%
So as I write this stuff, it's
hard to get hard information

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.699 align:middle line:84%
on it so I'm writing it as a
novel, A, because of one thing,

00:33:20.699 --> 00:33:23.240 align:middle line:84%
I think it will reach another
class of people that don't read

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.490 align:middle line:84%
non-fiction, and B, because
I really think I can tell

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:28.809 align:middle line:84%
the truth better
in a novel than--

00:33:28.809 --> 00:33:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.460 align:middle line:90%
Wink, wink, it's--

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: -non-fiction.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:31.331 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -a novel.

00:33:31.331 --> 00:33:34.640 align:middle line:90%


00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: But a lot of
the theme of this novel

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:40.190 align:middle line:84%
is the vulnerability
of world leaders today,

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.900 align:middle line:90%
including our own president.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that the president
really doesn't have much power.

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:48.410 align:middle line:84%
We, the people, do
ultimately have the power

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:49.976 align:middle line:90%
if we'll just take it.

00:33:49.976 --> 00:33:53.780 align:middle line:84%
But the president
is so vulnerable.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:57.910 align:middle line:84%
We saw that in
Kennedy's day, Kennedy

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:01.900 align:middle line:84%
was not dependent
upon big corporations.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.260 align:middle line:84%
His father had financed his
campaign, for the most part.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:09.929 align:middle line:84%
But very quickly he had
a fight with big steel

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:11.070 align:middle line:90%
and put big steel down.

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:12.028 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK BEGINS]

00:34:12.028 --> 00:34:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Increasing steel
prices by some $6 a ton

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:21.600 align:middle line:84%
constitute a wholly unjustified
and irresponsible defiance

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.690 align:middle line:90%
of the public interest.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:23.219 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK ENDS]

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:24.969 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: And he had
a fight with the CIA

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:27.909 align:middle line:84%
over the Bay of Pigs in Cuba
and the Cuban Missile Crisis

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:28.409 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:30.867 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But wasn't he trying
to go up against the Federal

00:34:30.867 --> 00:34:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Reserve as well?

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Yes.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.179 align:middle line:84%
I mean he was making
a lot of enemies.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And everybody knew that John
Kennedy had a lot of women

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.940 align:middle line:84%
in his life, including
famous ones like Marilyn

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Monroe and Angie Dickinson,
but it was OK in those days.

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.730 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't take
them out with that.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:47.710 align:middle line:10%
They had to take him
out with a bullet.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.929 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, his
brother came along and--

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:53.115 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But when you say that,
the media was more discreet.

00:34:53.115 --> 00:34:57.280 align:middle line:84%
They didn't necessarily-- that
wasn't the evening news with, I

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:01.520 align:middle line:84%
think, you had Walter Cronkite
in those days and Chet Huntley.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.110 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't the evening news.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.742 align:middle line:90%
Now that would be headline news.

00:35:05.742 --> 00:35:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Right.

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:10.020 align:middle line:84%
We've deteriorated so much,
because in those days,

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.830 align:middle line:84%
like still in so
much of the world,

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:14.970 align:middle line:84%
a politician or
leader's personal life

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.330 align:middle line:84%
is considered just
that, personal life.

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And we all have weaknesses,
and who can be perfect?

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.440 align:middle line:84%
But today, we have a
totally different standard

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and that gives a lot more
control to the press.

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And let's face it,
the mainstream media

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:33.680 align:middle line:84%
is owned by the
corporatocracy, either

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.580 align:middle line:84%
through outright
ownership or it's

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.206 align:middle line:84%
controlled through
advertising budgets.

00:35:37.206 --> 00:35:39.746 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and they have
a lot of CIA operatives at high

00:35:39.746 --> 00:35:40.246 align:middle line:90%
places--

00:35:40.246 --> 00:35:41.121 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Of course.

00:35:41.121 --> 00:35:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -with network media.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.505 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: There's a
tremendous interchange

00:35:43.505 --> 00:35:44.796 align:middle line:90%
of information between the two.

00:35:44.796 --> 00:35:46.092 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes there is.

00:35:46.092 --> 00:35:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, and they said in
editorial positions as well.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.530 align:middle line:90%
People need to know that.

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: It's absolutely true.

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:56.350 align:middle line:84%
There's a revolving door where
they're constantly changing.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:58.616 align:middle line:84%
And the same with
Robert Kennedy.

00:35:58.616 --> 00:35:59.740 align:middle line:90%
And Martin Luther King, Jr.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.570 align:middle line:84%
People knew that
Martin Luther King, Jr,

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:04.460 align:middle line:84%
had what we might call
a shady background.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.990 align:middle line:90%
He had skeletons in his closet.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:07.630 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't come out.

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Partly because the media
didn't bring it out.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.500 align:middle line:84%
The media was much more
independent in those days,

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.090 align:middle line:84%
and there was a
different standard.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:17.190 align:middle line:84%
But also partly because
people didn't-- it wasn't that

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.500 align:middle line:90%
important.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.150 align:middle line:90%
And things all changed.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think the women's
movement had a lot to do this.

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:24.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm all for it.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm totally for what came
out of the women's movement.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.310 align:middle line:84%
But it did create a
different moral standard.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:33.800 align:middle line:84%
So when Clinton comes
along, one of the big voices

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.910 align:middle line:84%
was against Monica Lewinsky
expressed by a lot of women

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:40.580 align:middle line:84%
around the country
because of poor Hillary.

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
different standard.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And in any case,
whatever it meant,

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.850 align:middle line:84%
it meant that a president
could be impeached because

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:52.565 align:middle line:84%
of a sexual act, which wasn't
even that interesting if you

00:36:52.565 --> 00:36:53.075 align:middle line:90%
ask me.

00:36:53.075 --> 00:36:53.675 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:36:53.675 --> 00:36:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: Most of the world
laughed at this whole thing.

00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know,
especially the French.

00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:59.380 align:middle line:84%
It was like, come
on, get a clue.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:02.030 align:middle line:84%
These are world leaders, they've
always done this, always will.

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:04.571 align:middle line:10%
>>PERKINS: And soon after that
we stopped eating French fries

00:37:04.571 --> 00:37:07.686 align:middle line:10%
and ate Freedom Fries.

00:37:07.686 --> 00:37:09.920 align:middle line:10%
That's one way to get back
at those immoral French.

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.520 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That didn't take.

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:16.560 align:middle line:84%
McDonald's still
sells French fries.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: But in any
case, a new standard's set

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:23.570 align:middle line:84%
and there's no doubt in my mind
that Linda Tripp was an agent.

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:26.435 align:middle line:84%
And she'd been in the
Bush administration,

00:37:26.435 --> 00:37:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and she'd been in the Pentagon,
and she set Monica up.

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:34.160 align:middle line:84%
She gave her a microphone and
said, don't wash the dress,

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.610 align:middle line:90%
don't launder it.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:38.570 align:middle line:90%
It was a set up, it was a hit.

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:40.150 align:middle line:90%
And Clinton got taken out.

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And it looked as though at
that time that Clinton was--

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.840 align:middle line:84%
as he was getting prepared when
he left office to maybe go up

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.750 align:middle line:84%
against the Federal Reserve,
maybe do a few other things.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.430 align:middle line:84%
But he hasn't done
anything, obviously,

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.122 align:middle line:84%
except now he hangs
out with the Bushes.

00:37:52.122 --> 00:37:52.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I was just going
to bring that up.

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:54.529 align:middle line:90%
Now they're all friends.

00:37:54.529 --> 00:37:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: They're all friends.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Well, he got the message.

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that Obama, if
he hadn't happened before,

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:05.700 align:middle line:84%
as soon as he walked
into the Oval Office,

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.900 align:middle line:90%
he got the message.

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Like you're very, very
vulnerable, Mr. Obama,

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to
realize that you've

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.480 align:middle line:84%
got a few skeletons
in your closet.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And even if you don't,
between the FBI and the media,

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:22.040 align:middle line:84%
we can create them, so
you better play the game.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And then they shot a few shots
across his bow, you know,

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.305 align:middle line:84%
like is he a citizen,
is he gay, whatever

00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:28.430 align:middle line:90%
all these different things.

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:29.585 align:middle line:90%
Was he born in Indonesia?

00:38:29.585 --> 00:38:30.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And not too long after that, the
head of the IMF, Strauss Kahn,

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.570 align:middle line:84%
was brought down
by an accusation

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:43.770 align:middle line:84%
by a chambermaid in
a hotel in New York.

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:46.816 align:middle line:84%
And which was subsequently
thrown out of the courts.

00:38:46.816 --> 00:38:48.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
truth behind it.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he raped her,
maybe he didn't.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.070 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:53.690 align:middle line:84%
But what I do know is that when
something like that happens,

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:58.300 align:middle line:84%
it puts the fear of God in Obama
and every other politician.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Because what they see is it
doesn't matter whether it turns

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:03.880 align:middle line:84%
out to be true or not,
all you've got to do

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:08.090 align:middle line:84%
is have a scandal, a rumor,
and you're emasculated.

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:09.410 align:middle line:90%
You're assassinated.

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Character assassination
is every bit as effective

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.870 align:middle line:84%
as physical assassination
in terms of politics.

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And the way that the CIA works
with corporations to help them

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.700 align:middle line:84%
around the world establish
themselves, and it's mutual.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.350 align:middle line:84%
They work with each other
very, very, very closely.

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:29.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a complex system.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.743 align:middle line:84%
And I wish I could say there's
this conspiracy with one person

00:39:33.743 --> 00:39:34.570 align:middle line:90%
up there.

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Because if we believe that and
we could find that one person,

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.440 align:middle line:84%
we could take care
of everything.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.040 align:middle line:90%
But it isn't.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.560 align:middle line:84%
It's much more
complex than that.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.560 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really
important for we, the people,

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.390 align:middle line:84%
in the United States and around
the world to understand this.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Meanwhile,
we have Greece

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:50.190 align:middle line:90%
and what's happened there.

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And you just wrote a
recent article on that.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.330 align:middle line:84%
What is your perception
when you look

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:57.500 align:middle line:84%
at it from an economic
hitman point of view,

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.580 align:middle line:84%
you look at it from
a debt point of view,

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.870 align:middle line:84%
and then also the repercussions,
which, as you say,

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:06.455 align:middle line:84%
is ultimately privatization
of public institutions.

00:40:06.455 --> 00:40:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Yes.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.650 align:middle line:84%
You know I've been spending
a lot of time recently--

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and I spent a lot
of Latin America--

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:13.440 align:middle line:84%
but I was also fairly
recently in Iceland

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and I just came back from the
United Kingdom and Ireland

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:19.180 align:middle line:90%
and lecturing in these places.

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And what's been going
on throughout Europe,

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and I would include Iceland
as part of that category,

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:31.100 align:middle line:90%
is a big hit by economic hitmen.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's been this intent of
putting people deep into debt,

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.750 align:middle line:84%
whether it's national
debt or personal debt,

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:41.470 align:middle line:84%
private debt, as
a way of getting

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:43.560 align:middle line:90%
more and more control over them.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
different iterations.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So what happened
in Iceland is quite

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.408 align:middle line:84%
different from what's
happening in Greece

00:40:49.408 --> 00:40:51.960 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening in
Spain, which Spain now

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.260 align:middle line:90%
is in the deep depression.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:54.760 align:middle line:90%
More than--

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is
it, 50% unemployment?

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: -50% of its
young people are unemployed.

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening in
Ireland is different.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:08.506 align:middle line:84%
But in all these cases, you
can see that the solution today

00:41:08.506 --> 00:41:12.510 align:middle line:84%
advocated by the big
banks and by governments

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:15.150 align:middle line:84%
primarily, because they're
controlled by the big banks

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:17.030 align:middle line:84%
or they're in
collusion with them--

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:19.140 align:middle line:90%
is austerity for the people.

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Don't tax the wealthy.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Don't do anything to hurt
the banks or the wealthy,

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.900 align:middle line:84%
but force the people into
deeper and deeper austerity.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.230 align:middle line:90%
That is not the answer.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:27.730 align:middle line:90%
We know.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:28.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm an economist.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Any self-respecting economist
who has really studied

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:35.411 align:middle line:84%
the Great Depression and other
depressions knows that what

00:41:35.411 --> 00:41:36.160 align:middle line:90%
you've got to do--

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't
punish the people.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: You don't
punish the people.

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And you do invest money in
things that employ people.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.440 align:middle line:90%
What we need is employment.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.450 align:middle line:90%
That is the big one.

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:47.320 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter that the
GNP or GDP is going up,

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.600 align:middle line:84%
that a few corporations
and a few individuals,

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:54.200 align:middle line:84%
this 0.000035% of the
population, is doing better.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:57.670 align:middle line:84%
That may make the statistics
go up, but what we really need

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:01.030 align:middle line:84%
is to get employment,
to get people to work,

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:03.640 align:middle line:84%
to get people to be able to
pay off these incredible debts

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.840 align:middle line:84%
that they have on their credit
cards and on their homes.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's this
double-edged sword then

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.580 align:middle line:84%
where you're talking about going
into Greece, or any country

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:15.550 align:middle line:84%
really, and then privatizing
public sector types

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:17.810 align:middle line:90%
of institutional jobs and such.

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:19.330 align:middle line:90%
On one hand, need jobs.

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:22.060 align:middle line:84%
On the other, it wouldn't
be the government

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.740 align:middle line:84%
that would be providing
that any longer.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:27.140 align:middle line:84%
It would be some of these
preferred private corporations.

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:29.346 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: It's called
asset stripping,

00:42:29.346 --> 00:42:31.370 align:middle line:84%
and it's part of
empire building.

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:33.500 align:middle line:90%
It's as old as empire.

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's what part of my job was
when I was an economic hitman,

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:41.680 align:middle line:84%
was to put these
countries deep into debt,

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.820 align:middle line:84%
and then they
couldn't pay the debt.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So then we go back
in-- usually it

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:47.870 align:middle line:84%
was the World Bank and
its sisters that put them

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:50.590 align:middle line:84%
into the debt, along with
me, the economic hitman.

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Then the IMF goes in to help
them restructure the debt.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.480 align:middle line:84%
What the IMF does
is demand that they

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:00.512 align:middle line:84%
have certain forms of
government, A, that we like.

00:43:00.512 --> 00:43:02.220 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to be
democratic, as long

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.390 align:middle line:84%
as they are supporting
our corporations.

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And that they sell what
we'd consider public assets,

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:11.130 align:middle line:84%
like electric companies and
water and sewage companies,

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and maybe their prisons and
their schools and their ports

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and their airports
and their highways,

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.770 align:middle line:84%
sell them to private
corporations.

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So again, it goes
back to this theory

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.770 align:middle line:84%
that the only
responsibility of business

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:25.210 align:middle line:84%
is to maximize profits,
and businesses shouldn't

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:28.040 align:middle line:84%
be regulated, and everything
should be privatized.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Get government out, let the
big corporations control

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.100 align:middle line:90%
the governments.

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.130 align:middle line:90%
They control the assets.

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:35.490 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, it's happened.

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Even before they
control the assets,

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.400 align:middle line:84%
already the big
corporations control

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.970 align:middle line:84%
most of the world's
major governments

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:42.240 align:middle line:90%
in one way or another.

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And they control the
mainstream press.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And so this asset
stripping is just

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:48.857 align:middle line:90%
another step in that direction.

00:43:48.857 --> 00:43:51.440 align:middle line:84%
It's putting everything in the
hands of the big corporations--

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.010 align:middle line:84%
of what I call the
corporatocracy, the few,

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:59.260 align:middle line:84%
primarily men, few women around
the world who run our biggest

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:00.544 align:middle line:90%
multinational corporations.

00:44:00.544 --> 00:44:02.210 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones who
are taking control.

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:05.390 align:middle line:84%
They're the modern
equivalent of the emperor.

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:07.320 align:middle line:90%
And I think this is the hope.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.280 align:middle line:84%
That every one of us
needs to recognize

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.220 align:middle line:84%
that we, as individuals,
have tremendous power,

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.180 align:middle line:90%
each individual, we all have it.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.510 align:middle line:90%
And each of us has passions.

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:18.780 align:middle line:90%
And we have talents.

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.541 align:middle line:84%
So I have a passion for
writing, and hopefully,

00:44:21.541 --> 00:44:22.290 align:middle line:90%
some talent at it.

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:25.680 align:middle line:84%
You have a passion and talent
for producing documentaries

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.730 align:middle line:90%
and films.

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:28.950 align:middle line:84%
But everybody has
passion and talent.

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And if we all channel those
passions and those talents

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:34.270 align:middle line:84%
toward creating a
sustainable, just,

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:36.750 align:middle line:84%
peaceful world that's
thriving for all beings--

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:37.680 align:middle line:90%
we will get there.

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:40.070 align:middle line:84%
I think this needs to
be the mantra today.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And we need to
recognize that we've

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.550 align:middle line:84%
got to force the corporations--
that the corporations are

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:45.560 align:middle line:90%
very, very vulnerable.

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:48.570 align:middle line:84%
They're running the world,
and we run them ultimately.

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: The marketplace
is a democracy,

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:52.940 align:middle line:90%
if we choose to make it that.

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And we've shown this
time and time again.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:58.200 align:middle line:84%
When I was in college, there
was apartheid in South Africa

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.240 align:middle line:84%
and we boycotted
corporations that

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.140 align:middle line:90%
supported it and it changed.

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And now I think we have
to take this up a notch

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:07.409 align:middle line:84%
and convince the
corporations we're only

00:45:07.409 --> 00:45:09.700 align:middle line:84%
going to buy from those
corporations that are committed

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:12.380 align:middle line:84%
to making a decent rate of
return on their capital.

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:12.940 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.944 align:middle line:84%
But not maximizing
profits regardless

00:45:14.944 --> 00:45:16.360 align:middle line:84%
of social and
environmental cause.

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.750 align:middle line:84%
They've got to be
committed to being socially

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and environmentally
responsible, to creating a world

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:25.590 align:middle line:84%
that my grandson, who is 5 years
old, will want to grow up in.

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And to recognize
that that world has

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.420 align:middle line:84%
to include every
child on the planet.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.580 align:middle line:90%
And this is new in history.

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.830 align:middle line:84%
We used to only have to worry
about the United States.

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:35.230 align:middle line:84%
That was certainly
true in World War II.

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:36.688 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is a
global community.

00:45:36.688 --> 00:45:39.475 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: Today, we've got
to recognize that my grandson

00:45:39.475 --> 00:45:43.210 align:middle line:84%
in the United States cannot
inherit a sustainable, just,

00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:45.980 align:middle line:84%
peaceful, thriving world
unless every child growing up

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:50.310 align:middle line:84%
in Bolivia, Botswana,
Indonesia, Palestine,

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:53.390 align:middle line:84%
and Israel also inherits
that same world.

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:54.520 align:middle line:90%
This is new.

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.606 align:middle line:84%
We've discovered--
and we're all talking

00:45:56.606 --> 00:45:57.980 align:middle line:84%
to each other for
the first time,

00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:59.650 align:middle line:84%
we're communicating
across the planet

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:01.480 align:middle line:84%
through all these
technologies, and we've

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:05.730 align:middle line:84%
discovered that we're living
on a very, very fragile space

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:06.880 align:middle line:90%
station.

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:10.900 align:middle line:84%
But unlike the space station
that our astronauts built,

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:13.520 align:middle line:84%
this one doesn't
have any shuttles.

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.947 align:middle line:90%
You can't get off.

00:46:14.947 --> 00:46:16.260 align:middle line:90%
I can't get off.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And debt is the modern
chains of slavery.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:25.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's get to Latin Americans
and what happened there,

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:26.780 align:middle line:84%
some recent scandals
that occurred

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:28.209 align:middle line:90%
and the extension of that.

00:46:28.209 --> 00:46:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: Well,
first of all, I want

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:32.250 align:middle line:84%
to say that in
the last 10 years,

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:37.280 align:middle line:84%
10 countries in Latin America
representing more than 80%

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.170 align:middle line:84%
of the population
of South America

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:42.340 align:middle line:84%
have voted in in
democratic elections,

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:44.870 align:middle line:84%
presidents that have stood
up to the corporatocracy.

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:46.620 align:middle line:84%
There have been varying
different degrees.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's been amazing.

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:47.846 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Yeah.

00:46:47.846 --> 00:46:51.420 align:middle line:84%
It's been different in
Bolivia from Ecuador or Chile

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:53.190 align:middle line:84%
or Argentina, they're
all different.

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:54.940 align:middle line:84%
But every one of
these 10 countries

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:58.130 align:middle line:84%
during most of my lifetime
was run by brutal dictators,

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:01.060 align:middle line:84%
primarily put into power by the
CIA and kept there by the CIA.

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:02.390 align:middle line:90%
And this is all changed.

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:05.540 align:middle line:84%
It actually changed
after 2002, after Chavez

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:07.329 align:middle line:84%
showed that he could
stand up to the CIA.

00:47:07.329 --> 00:47:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he
wasn't assassinated.

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: No.

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.610 align:middle line:90%
We backed down.

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Bush and the CIA were
shown as paper tigers.

00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And you can think whatever
you want about Chavez,

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:19.446 align:middle line:90%
he's eccentric to say the least.

00:47:19.446 --> 00:47:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's a
big personality.

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: But the
fact of the matter

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.505 align:middle line:84%
is he changed history
in Latin America.

00:47:23.505 --> 00:47:24.530 align:middle line:90%
So big things happened.

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:26.654 align:middle line:84%
There's been a real
revolution, a quiet revolution.

00:47:26.654 --> 00:47:29.060 align:middle line:84%
We don't talk about it
in the United States.

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:30.680 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make the
press even hardly.

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.410 align:middle line:90%
But it's been big.

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:34.565 align:middle line:84%
And one example of how
it doesn't make the press

00:47:34.565 --> 00:47:38.020 align:middle line:84%
is that the recent summit that
was held in Cartagena, Colombia

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:43.780 align:middle line:84%
that Obama was at, the majority
of the presidents of Latin

00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:46.350 align:middle line:84%
America really
strongly protested

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:48.941 align:middle line:84%
US policies toward drug
trafficking and the fact

00:47:48.941 --> 00:47:50.565 align:middle line:84%
that they said, you've
got to get drugs

00:47:50.565 --> 00:47:52.320 align:middle line:90%
under control in your country.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not about sending
your military down here

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:56.320 align:middle line:84%
or your CIA to Columbia, or
Mexico or other countries.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're the consumers.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:58.963 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: You're the consumers.

00:47:58.963 --> 00:48:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Mr. President, Mr. Obama
take this seriously.

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And several other
issues like this

00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:08.030 align:middle line:84%
never made the news
in the United States.

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And instead, we focused on a
dozen Secret Security agents

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:16.210 align:middle line:84%
who had prostitutes in their
hotel room, which incidentally

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:17.465 align:middle line:90%
is not illegal in Colombia.

00:48:17.465 --> 00:48:20.420 align:middle line:84%
It may be against the
Secret Service policy,

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:22.830 align:middle line:84%
but what concerned
me is I couldn't

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:25.320 align:middle line:84%
get any news about
what was going

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.110 align:middle line:84%
on in that summit
in the US press.

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Just minimal amounts except
about the prostitution

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.720 align:middle line:90%
scandal with the Secret Service.

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.760 align:middle line:84%
To get the real news,
I had to go online.

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.100 align:middle line:90%
Fortunately, I read Spanish.

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:40.166 align:middle line:84%
I could get the real news from
Latin American publications.

00:48:40.166 --> 00:48:41.540 align:middle line:84%
But the American
people are being

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:44.104 align:middle line:84%
kept in the dark
in so many ways.

00:48:44.104 --> 00:48:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big
things is we're

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.436 align:middle line:84%
kept in the dark about
the amazing things that

00:48:47.436 --> 00:48:49.590 align:middle line:84%
have been going on
in Latin America.

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And now the fact that we are
overthrowing governments,

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:57.690 align:middle line:84%
like Zelaya and attempt
at Correa in Ecuador--

00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and because these countries have
elected these presidents now,

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:04.100 align:middle line:84%
the economic hitmen
are going in.

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:06.130 align:middle line:84%
They're playing the game
that I used to play.

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And you know, just a few months
ago I spoke at a conference

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:10.330 align:middle line:90%
in Istanbul.

00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:14.980 align:middle line:84%
4,000 leaders of the
communications industry,

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:18.110 align:middle line:84%
CFOs and CEOs of big
communications companies, and I

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:20.078 align:middle line:90%
was the keynote opening speaker.

00:49:20.078 --> 00:49:21.536 align:middle line:84%
And what I said to
these people is,

00:49:21.536 --> 00:49:23.680 align:middle line:84%
you know, we've created
a world-- now you've

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.520 align:middle line:84%
created a world
where everybody's

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:28.140 align:middle line:84%
talking to everybody else
through the internet,

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:32.670 align:middle line:84%
through Skyping,
through cell phones.

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:34.577 align:middle line:84%
But you now have
to ask yourselves,

00:49:34.577 --> 00:49:36.660 align:middle line:84%
what do you want these
people to be communicating?

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:39.076 align:middle line:84%
What are you going to encourage
them to communicate about?

00:49:39.076 --> 00:49:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Do you want them to
continue to discuss the sex

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.690 align:middle line:84%
lives of Hollywood
stars and politicians?

00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:45.800 align:middle line:84%
The latest fashions
in Paris and New York?

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who is in rehab?

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.485 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Who is in rehab?

00:49:47.485 --> 00:49:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And who's winning the World
Cup and so on and so forth.

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:52.680 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a little bit.

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:56.010 align:middle line:84%
But let's focus on
what's really important.

00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:57.977 align:middle line:84%
And people are
hungering for this.

00:49:57.977 --> 00:49:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:01.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not like there's a
shortage of good information.

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:04.430 align:middle line:84%
It's just that en mass, we
need to start valuing it.

00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And also, talk about
the corporatocracy

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.770 align:middle line:90%
and its power or not.

00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:11.264 align:middle line:84%
As you said earlier, the power
is actually in our hands,

00:50:11.264 --> 00:50:12.930 align:middle line:84%
all you have to do
is turn off the media

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:14.232 align:middle line:90%
and now you have panic.

00:50:14.232 --> 00:50:16.190 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
advertising dollars flowing,

00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:18.020 align:middle line:84%
a lot of impressions
that are trying

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:21.430 align:middle line:84%
to be laid through that
media to sell those products,

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:23.870 align:middle line:84%
so that they can keep these
ridiculous policies going

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:24.850 align:middle line:90%
in other countries.

00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:26.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a really
interesting circle.

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.419 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Well, it is.

00:50:27.419 --> 00:50:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's really all
in our hands, isn't it?

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Yes, it is.

00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:32.905 align:middle line:84%
We do have control if
we just recognize that.

00:50:32.905 --> 00:50:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the Dalai Lama,
you sat next-- I love this.

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:38.410 align:middle line:84%
I asked you this last time-- but
the Dalai Lama was next to you

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:40.080 align:middle line:84%
on the airplane
one time and he had

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:43.120 align:middle line:84%
read "Confessions of an
Economic Hit Man," hadn't he?

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: He had read-- it
was before it was came out

00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:46.440 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:47.730 align:middle line:90%
He'd read "Shape Shifting."

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Shape Shifting," OK.

00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:52.542 align:middle line:10%
And so you were talking
with him back and forth,

00:50:52.542 --> 00:50:54.500 align:middle line:10%
and wasn't he telling
you something, I thought,

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:57.860 align:middle line:10%
profound about
meditation is great but.

00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.404 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: Yeah,
so the Dalai Lama

00:50:59.404 --> 00:51:01.320 align:middle line:84%
invited me to sit next
to him on the airplane.

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And then he invited my whole
group--I was leading a group

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:07.750 align:middle line:84%
of about 30 people-- to
his house in Dharamsala

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:09.190 align:middle line:84%
for a meeting in
his living room.

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And at that talk
he said, "You know,

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.380 align:middle line:84%
it's good to meditate
and pray for peace,

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:19.770 align:middle line:84%
but if that's all you do,
forget it, because," he said,

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:21.500 align:middle line:90%
"we have to take action, too."

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, he went on
to say that if all you do

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:26.630 align:middle line:84%
is pray for peace and
meditate for peace and figure

00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:28.690 align:middle line:84%
you've done your
job and walk away,

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:29.960 align:middle line:90%
then it's counterproductive.

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we've really all got
to go out and take action

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.620 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think the Dalai Lama is
such a great example of that.

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Here's one of the world's
great spiritual leaders

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:41.600 align:middle line:84%
who meditates for
hours every day,

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.030 align:middle line:90%
but he's also always out there.

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:45.977 align:middle line:84%
He's got hundreds of
best selling books out.

00:51:45.977 --> 00:51:47.435 align:middle line:84%
He seems to be
speaking everywhere.

00:51:47.435 --> 00:51:48.922 align:middle line:84%
I travel around
the world speaking

00:51:48.922 --> 00:51:50.838 align:middle line:84%
and the Dalai Lama is
always right ahead of me

00:51:50.838 --> 00:51:52.250 align:middle line:90%
or right behind me.

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:53.014 align:middle line:90%
He's everywhere.

00:51:53.014 --> 00:51:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he's had to
deal with political strife

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and manipulation in his
own country and his people.

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:02.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as though he's
not familiar with this.

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:05.200 align:middle line:84%
He understands what happens
when a government chooses

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:08.880 align:middle line:84%
to lay an impression
or unseat indigenous

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.062 align:middle line:90%
people and their ways.

00:52:10.062 --> 00:52:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: The Dalai Lama's
a great example that way.

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And Mother Teresa
was another one.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.630 align:middle line:90%
And there's so many.

00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:18.449 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people
doing amazing, amazing things

00:52:18.449 --> 00:52:18.990 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:22.420 align:middle line:84%
I think what we each have to
recognize is that each of us

00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.450 align:middle line:90%
has that ability.

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:28.335 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us has the ability
to do what Rosa Parks did

00:52:28.335 --> 00:52:29.820 align:middle line:90%
and walk to the front of a bus.

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:33.270 align:middle line:84%
It may take courage, but
she changed the world

00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:35.260 align:middle line:84%
by walking to the
front of a bus.

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Or Rachel Carson sat down
one day at a little desk

00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:41.980 align:middle line:84%
in Pennsylvania and started
scribbling out with a pencil

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:44.420 align:middle line:90%
a book called "Silent Spring."

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:46.560 align:middle line:84%
She had no idea it
would ever be published.

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:48.604 align:middle line:84%
Much less that it would start
a whole environmental movement

00:52:48.604 --> 00:52:49.312 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:52:49.312 --> 00:52:53.000 align:middle line:84%
It really was the
driving force behind what

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.850 align:middle line:84%
today is the
environmental movement.

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:56.890 align:middle line:84%
She just sat down at a
desk and started writing.

00:52:56.890 --> 00:53:02.010 align:middle line:84%
We all have the power to do
whatever it is we do best,

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and to recognize that
it can change the world.

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.280 align:middle line:90%
Each one of us has that ability.

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And when we all come together
and commit to doing that,

00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:10.640 align:middle line:90%
it will happen.

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:11.804 align:middle line:90%
I'm very hopeful.

00:53:11.804 --> 00:53:12.970 align:middle line:90%
I know it's going to happen.

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:14.500 align:middle line:84%
I know we're going
to pull through this

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:15.510 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to do this.

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:16.955 align:middle line:90%
I think we are.

00:53:16.955 --> 00:53:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's really going to
rest on the next generation.

00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And as we wrap up
our conversation,

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:24.600 align:middle line:84%
any final comment about--
you've mentioned your grandson

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.220 align:middle line:84%
a couple of times now,
who is now five years old,

00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:32.540 align:middle line:84%
any thoughts on how we
inspire the next generation

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:34.710 align:middle line:84%
or what our
responsibility to them

00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:middle line:84%
is in releasing these
charades, these illusions?

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: I think what we
need to tell this upcoming

00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:45.140 align:middle line:84%
generation, and I do every
chance I get in speaking out

00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and so forth and with young
kids too, very young kids, is

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:51.110 align:middle line:84%
that we're in perhaps
the most revolutionary

00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:52.750 align:middle line:90%
times in human history.

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:54.970 align:middle line:84%
We're in a bigger revolution
than the Agricultural

00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:56.746 align:middle line:84%
Revolution or the
Industrial Revolution

00:53:56.746 --> 00:53:57.870 align:middle line:90%
or the American Revolution.

00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:59.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a revolution
of consciousness.

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:01.500 align:middle line:90%
We're waking up.

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing it in
the Occupy movement,

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:04.620 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing it in
the Arab Spring,

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.560 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing it in what's
happening in Latin America,

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:08.220 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing it in what's
happening in Europe,

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:10.430 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing it with
demonstrations against Putin

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and things happening in
China, people around the world

00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.500 align:middle line:90%
are really beginning to wake up.

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Thank goodness for
movies like this,

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:19.590 align:middle line:84%
for getting this
information out.

00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:20.900 align:middle line:90%
People are getting it.

00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to let
the young folks know

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:25.140 align:middle line:90%
that just follow their passions.

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:28.910 align:middle line:84%
We've got to create a better
world, and we can do it.

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:30.400 align:middle line:84%
The information's
getting out there

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.790 align:middle line:90%
and we have the power to do it.

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:34.910 align:middle line:84%
The corporations are
running the world today,

00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and that's good
news because we have

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.070 align:middle line:90%
control over the corporations.

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Every time you buy
something or choose not to,

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:43.810 align:middle line:90%
you're casting a vote.

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a much more
powerful vote than the one you

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:49.730 align:middle line:84%
cast every four years,
or maybe every two years,

00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:51.160 align:middle line:90%
in the ballot boxes.

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.447 align:middle line:84%
Because you're casting
this one frequently.

00:54:53.447 --> 00:54:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's going right
to the real power

00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:56.801 align:middle line:84%
sources, which is
the corporations.

00:54:56.801 --> 00:54:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And you have to let
the corporations know.

00:54:58.550 --> 00:54:59.800 align:middle line:84%
You've got to send
an email and let

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.716 align:middle line:84%
them know why you're not
buying their products

00:55:01.716 --> 00:55:04.181 align:middle line:84%
or why you are buying
their products.

00:55:04.181 --> 00:55:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And to recognize that we
have this amazing power.

00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And to let our children
and grandchildren

00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:13.930 align:middle line:84%
really feel empowered
and with the hope

00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:16.370 align:middle line:84%
that we can do
something much greater.

00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:19.062 align:middle line:84%
And the recognition that there's
prophecies in every indigenous

00:55:19.062 --> 00:55:20.520 align:middle line:84%
culture that I'm
aware of, and I've

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.845 align:middle line:84%
worked with many around the
world, that tell us we're

00:55:22.845 --> 00:55:26.939 align:middle line:84%
at this time for the potential
for tremendous transformation.

00:55:26.939 --> 00:55:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are, indeed.

00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:30.660 align:middle line:84%
But it does require
our participation.

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And then we come down to the
simplest little conundrum,

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:35.670 align:middle line:90%
like bananas.

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:40.720 align:middle line:84%
How do you get your bananas when
you cut out Chiquita and Dole?

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:44.820 align:middle line:84%
I say that tongue-in-cheek,
how do you do that?

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: That's
an interesting one

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:50.827 align:middle line:84%
because I teach a lot at Omega,
what you would call a new age

00:55:50.827 --> 00:55:52.410 align:middle line:84%
teaching facility
in upstate New York,

00:55:52.410 --> 00:55:56.151 align:middle line:84%
and they are very
committed to being socially

00:55:56.151 --> 00:55:57.400 align:middle line:90%
and environmentally conscious.

00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that
their bananas were Dole.

00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I told the
CEO, I said, don't you

00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:07.440 align:middle line:84%
know that Dole is killing people
and treating people brutally

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:10.220 align:middle line:84%
throughout Central America
and parts of South America?

00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So he went back to
the distributor,

00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:15.090 align:middle line:84%
and the distributor
didn't know this either.

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:17.276 align:middle line:84%
And so the distributor
said, gosh, we're

00:56:17.276 --> 00:56:19.390 align:middle line:84%
going to cancel all of
our contracts with Dole

00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:20.270 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
find alternatives.

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.811 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:56:20.811 --> 00:56:25.004 align:middle line:84%
They found fair trade
bananas from South America.

00:56:25.004 --> 00:56:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, that's
what we need to do,

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:27.504 align:middle line:90%
put our pressure on.

00:56:27.504 --> 00:56:29.544 align:middle line:84%
>>PERKINS: Put your pressure
on your local store.

00:56:29.544 --> 00:56:31.260 align:middle line:84%
There are fair
trade bananas that

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:35.120 align:middle line:84%
are not Dole or
Chiquita or Del Monte.

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And put pressure on your
store, and put pressure

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:38.330 align:middle line:90%
on your suppliers.

00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:39.632 align:middle line:90%
And that mushrooms.

00:56:39.632 --> 00:56:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it does.

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:42.715 align:middle line:84%
And there's a good place
to start, with the morning

00:56:42.715 --> 00:56:43.810 align:middle line:90%
smoothie.

00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:46.729 align:middle line:84%
So on that note, I thank you
so much for taking the time.

00:56:46.729 --> 00:56:48.270 align:middle line:84%
I know you're on
your way to Ecuador.

00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:50.590 align:middle line:84%
You have ongoing
relationships there

00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:52.180 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of good
stuff coming up

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and you've taken
this time with us.

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:54.650 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PERKINS: Thank you very much.

00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:55.990 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure.

00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:57.005 align:middle line:90%
Keep up your great work.

00:56:57.005 --> 00:56:58.139 align:middle line:90%
This is so important.

00:56:58.139 --> 00:57:00.430 align:middle line:84%
This is what freedom of the
press is all about, Regina.

00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:03.027 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for doing what you do.

00:57:03.027 --> 00:57:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I highly encourage
you to read his book,

00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:08.240 align:middle line:84%
"Confessions of an Economic Hit
Man," and the follow up book,

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.020 align:middle line:90%
"Hoodwinked."

00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Both provide an
invaluable education

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:13.350 align:middle line:90%
in economics and politics.

00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you might also
enjoy my previous conversation

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:18.340 align:middle line:84%

find under Conscious Media

Network on this site.

00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
