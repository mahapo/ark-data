00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:21.310 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: The
world has been through one

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.410 align:middle line:10%
of the greatest
stressors imaginable--

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.260 align:middle line:10%
a pandemic that ground the
global economy to a virtual

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.400 align:middle line:10%
halt for a few months.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.210 align:middle line:84%
The gift in this is that we
gave people time to be still

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.190 align:middle line:90%
and reflect on what matters.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Was our way of
living sustainable?

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Was it satisfying
on a social level?

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.880 align:middle line:84%
What needs to emerge for a
more whole way of engaging

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.900 align:middle line:90%
with life?

Zeus Yiamouyiannis, author
of Transforming Economy

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.210 align:middle line:84%
is with me today to
unwind how we ended up

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.790 align:middle line:84%
in such an unsustainable
way of life,

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.260 align:middle line:90%
and where we can go from here.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.610 align:middle line:90%
So hello.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:90%
Good to have you back again.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.335 align:middle line:84%
>> ZEUS YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Hi Regina.

00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Not that I
don't see you every day.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:90%
So let's go into this.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.760 align:middle line:84%
You were commenting
one time, and I had

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.927 align:middle line:90%
to make a little note of it.

00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:10%
It's so strange that
before the whole shut down,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.750 align:middle line:10%
the global shut down
occurred, people

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.970 align:middle line:10%
would go out to restaurants
and we'd always comment.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.040 align:middle line:84%
They'd be sitting there,
whole family with four

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.070 align:middle line:84%
or five people all
on their devices--

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.290 align:middle line:90%
on their cell phones.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Not even engaged with
each other while they're all

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.880 align:middle line:84%
going to their favorite
little cafes and restaurants.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And now with none
of that available,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:84%
the engagement between people
is just wonderful to see.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Where we live, it's
families out riding bikes

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.860 align:middle line:90%
with their kids, people Zooming.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:90%
You're involved with that.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Most of our friends are Zooming
family members and people

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.432 align:middle line:84%
they went to school
with around the world.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Something beautiful
is coming out of something that

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.087 align:middle line:90%
feels like it's a catastrophe.

00:01:46.087 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:10%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Well I think
what happened was as long as we

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.890 align:middle line:10%
could get our, sort
of, social needs met--

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:10%
kind of outside social
needs met, which is just

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.815 align:middle line:10%
being around each other.

00:01:57.815 --> 00:01:59.440 align:middle line:84%
We kind of lost the
internal connection

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:90%
we had with other people.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:10%
So you know, everything
was a flurry of activity.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.870 align:middle line:10%
And with the virtual reality
and with social media

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.639 align:middle line:10%
and with phones,
there always seemed

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.310 align:middle line:10%
to be something
urgent that stepped

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.020 align:middle line:10%
in front of the important.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, as Gaia, as
your own show demonstrates over

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and over, you cannot neglect the
internal without consequences.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
the only thing standing

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.410 align:middle line:84%
in the way of that internal is
our recognition and that time

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:90%
of reflection you're mentioning.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS:
And so this pandemic,

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
especially the lockdowns and
removal away from that flurry

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:84%
of activity, I would call
it addictive activity,

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.310 align:middle line:84%
economic and social activity
allowed for this internal voice

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.770 align:middle line:84%
to be heard, and the desire and
the loneliness to really reach

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.050 align:middle line:90%
someone on a substantive level.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Because even though,
you know, you

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.340 align:middle line:84%
used the example of
families sitting around

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.960 align:middle line:84%
like being involved
in their phones--

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.877 align:middle line:84%
even though we're using
electronic technology,

00:03:00.877 --> 00:03:03.340 align:middle line:84%
we're using it and much
more intimate way now

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.500 align:middle line:90%
to get families together.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, even yoga
studios are doing it over--

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I took tap classes.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.017 align:middle line:90%
Online tap dancing classes.

00:03:11.017 --> 00:03:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So we're beginning to explore
not so much the difference

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:84%
between technology
in a mechanical world

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and a human world, which was
kind of the old division.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.622 align:middle line:84%
Now we're beginning to see
that there are intimate ways

00:03:21.622 --> 00:03:23.468 align:middle line:84%
to use technologies
and non-intimate ways.

00:03:23.468 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So they work for us.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: So
that they work for us.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.745 align:middle line:84%
And the same with when
we're together-- there

00:03:27.745 --> 00:03:28.953 align:middle line:90%
are intimate ways to do that.

00:03:28.953 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Or we can be texting other
people, or even each other

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.790 align:middle line:84%
over the table while
we're together,

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:84%
instead of actually
talking and warmly letting

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:90%
the energy go between us.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And beginning to
develop things that

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:84%
are much more
important to us today,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.915 align:middle line:84%
rather than some diversion
or some little game

00:03:43.915 --> 00:03:45.290 align:middle line:84%
that we happen to
be involved in.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of--

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.350 align:middle line:84%
we were just in an addicted
chronic state of busyness.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.210 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't serving
anyone because, as I've

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:84%
said in other shows, the
one thing that's commonly

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:84%
said right now as things are
just getting ready to open back

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.720 align:middle line:84%
up again from this
in America anyway,

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.250 align:middle line:84%
is that people guiltily say,
I really kind of like this.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.543 align:middle line:90%
I like this pace of life.

00:04:08.543 --> 00:04:10.960 align:middle line:84%
That means we've really been
doing ourselves a disservice.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.610 align:middle line:84%
If this is kind of
a universal-- now

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.090 align:middle line:84%
there are people
who are suffering,

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.590 align:middle line:84%
who don't have enough food who
are fighting with each other.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.890 align:middle line:84%
But by and large, that not being
the case, people otherwise OK

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.960 align:middle line:84%
are seeing this
feels really good.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.452 align:middle line:84%
So now when you get
right into your book,

00:04:25.452 --> 00:04:27.910 align:middle line:84%
because this is where some of
the problems that got us here

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:28.930 align:middle line:90%
started.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.240 align:middle line:84%
The subtitle is from
Corrupted Capitalism

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.370 align:middle line:90%
to Connected Communities.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what does
that mean, first of all,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.745 align:middle line:90%
corrupted capitalism?

00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: In
very, very simple terms,

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.730 align:middle line:84%
corrupted capitalism is when
people serve money rather than

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.620 align:middle line:90%
money serving people.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:84%
When you give your
autonomy, your sovereignty,

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:84%
and in some sense, your choices
over to the mechanical things

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:84%
in life that are
driven by money,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:84%
that are driven for money and
the accumulation of money,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
lose your humanity.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's why it's corrupt.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Right, capitalism, and I
talk about in this book

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.910 align:middle line:84%
democratic capitalism,
which is the reverse where

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:90%
money actually serves people.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, where we aren't
trying to cut corners

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.870 align:middle line:90%
when we make products.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Or we aren't trying to put a
bunch of pesticides on fields

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:84%
just to make a
couple of extra bucks

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.350 align:middle line:84%
or produce a couple of
extra turnips or corn.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.930 align:middle line:84%
But we think about
where that corn

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.463 align:middle line:84%
or where that food is going
to go inside a person's body.

00:05:26.463 --> 00:05:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And we realize it's more
important for their health,

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.600 align:middle line:84%
for instance, and that's where
our organic foods comes in,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.090 align:middle line:84%
than it is to make a
couple of extra dollars.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So what's always, in a
non-corrupt capitalism,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:84%
what's always given the highest
priorities are those things you

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.130 align:middle line:90%
have in your reverse pyramid--

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:49.000 align:middle line:84%
health, nature, a truly healthy
social life, the ability

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.370 align:middle line:90%
for families to come together.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, when you
don't do that, what you get

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.850 align:middle line:90%
is no paid leave, sick leave.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.243 align:middle line:84%
Or no guaranteed
paid sick leave,

00:05:59.243 --> 00:06:00.910 align:middle line:84%
as what's happened
in the United States.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Even in the
United States, a very,

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.400 align:middle line:84%
kind of, ungenerous vacation
policy where you get two weeks

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:90%
of your life off.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.272 align:middle line:84%
Where in Germany, you get a good
six weeks right, for example.

00:06:10.272 --> 00:06:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: The ironic
thing about it is productivity

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.050 align:middle line:84%
is actually higher when you
value people over money.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And when we look at
the functional elements here,

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.130 align:middle line:84%
a couple of things I have
as, you know, the bailouts.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:84%
We had the bailouts of 2008 that
really rocked people and made

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.060 align:middle line:90%
them angry.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.518 align:middle line:84%
The same thing just
happened again.

00:06:26.518 --> 00:06:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: It did.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.770 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: The top corporations
and wealthiest people

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.010 align:middle line:10%
in the world shorted markets,
made billions as soon

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.670 align:middle line:10%
as the closures, you know, Covid
closures started happening.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.898 align:middle line:84%
Then they got bailed
out by the government.

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: To
the tune of trillions.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Trillions.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And where small
businesses are still

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.770 align:middle line:90%
waiting for even a stipend.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.245 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
kind of corruption

00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I assume you're talking
about that has put everyone

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.452 align:middle line:90%
in a vulnerable position.

00:06:49.452 --> 00:06:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Well, I mean,
an example of that was even

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.610 align:middle line:84%
a small business that considered
someone who had like say 50

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.300 align:middle line:84%
or fewer employees, well there
were hedge funds that were

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
making hundreds of millions of
dollars that were considered,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.010 align:middle line:84%
quote, small business, and they
got to the front of the line.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Rather than these
necessary businesses,

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry hedge funds, you
guys aren't that necessary.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.460 align:middle line:84%
We're serving whole communities
that were food based

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.967 align:middle line:84%
and so forth were more
toward the back of the line.

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very end of the line.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: I mean a bold
example of corrupt capitalism.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Because again, what was
the signifier that put you

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:25.840 align:middle line:90%
to the front of the line?

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.530 align:middle line:90%
Connection-- money, power.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:34.055 align:middle line:84%
Not life, liveliness, not
health, not necessity.

00:07:34.055 --> 00:07:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Not cooperation.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Not cooperation.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.423 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Not care.

00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:38.260 align:middle line:90%
Not compassion.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And if we
are to move from corrupted

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.700 align:middle line:84%
capitalism to
connected communities,

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.560 align:middle line:84%
that is the move
that has to be made.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.660 align:middle line:90%
That order has to be reversed.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so right now
though the problem is this

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.460 align:middle line:84%
perception with people,
especially if people watch

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle line:84%
a lot of media and
mainstream news.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And doesn't matter which side
you watch on mainstream news.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:90%
It can be conservative.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.970 align:middle line:90%
It can be progressive.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:58.770 align:middle line:90%
It can be liberal.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.870 align:middle line:84%
If it's mainstream, you're
getting this reflection

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:84%
that the stock
markets of the world

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.880 align:middle line:84%
somehow reflect our
economic health.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.070 align:middle line:10%
This was made very
plain to me in watching

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.540 align:middle line:10%
a video in which
they were talking

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle line:10%
about the various kind
of multiple crises

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:10%
happening at one time.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.415 align:middle line:84%
You know, physical,
social, economic.

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And they said and then we don't
want to see a financial crisis.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wait a minute--
you just said economic.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And then I realize the
two aren't linked at all.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.610 align:middle line:84%
This BS game of showing
us on the news what's

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.250 align:middle line:84%
happening in the stock
market is a little game

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:90%
for the power elite.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there
are, yes, some people

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.640 align:middle line:84%
have some of their money tied
up in pension plans in it.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.950 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't represent us.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.370 align:middle line:84%
90% of it is just algorithm
trading to begin with.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:90%
It's not even people driven.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at one
of the graphs here.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.890 align:middle line:10%
The one from Zero Hedge.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.070 align:middle line:10%
The green line indicating
the stock market

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.573 align:middle line:10%
as we see it, which
is totally artificial.

00:08:56.573 --> 00:08:58.990 align:middle line:10%
So what does that mean-- that
green line we're looking at?

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.820 align:middle line:10%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: The green line
has to do with the actual price

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.110 align:middle line:10%
of stocks.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:06.752 align:middle line:10%
So again, stocks don't have
to reflect earnings or value.

00:09:06.752 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Not anymore.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.335 align:middle line:10%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Not productive value.

00:09:09.335 --> 00:09:11.380 align:middle line:10%
All they have to do
is reflect demand.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:84%
So literally if you just
print money and borrow it

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.727 align:middle line:84%
for zero interest and you
throw it into your company,

00:09:16.727 --> 00:09:18.310 align:middle line:84%
even if your company
is going downhill

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.340 align:middle line:84%
in terms of productivity, in
terms of real world value,

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.225 align:middle line:90%
it'll go up in price.

00:09:23.225 --> 00:09:24.350 align:middle line:90%
So that's what's happening.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:25.517 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's not value.

00:09:25.517 --> 00:09:27.130 align:middle line:90%
That's price, not value.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: When
they say value of a stock,

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.540 align:middle line:84%
they're talking about
price of a stock.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Nothing
with real value.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Nothing with real value,

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.210 align:middle line:84%
with financial value or with
kind of manipulated value.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to bring
this up because people

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.900 align:middle line:84%
do watch the news and say,
oh no, our economy is OK.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:90%
Stock markets OK.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.570 align:middle line:90%
Pop back up again.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.030 align:middle line:10%
So OK, so then
what's this red line

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.930 align:middle line:10%
mean here, which is more
of a real world value?

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:52.930 align:middle line:10%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.100 align:middle line:10%
Earnings per share.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:10%
That means how much
is your actual stock

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.930 align:middle line:10%
and the public company
that it represent

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:02.560 align:middle line:10%
bringing in revenue from
the productive capacities,

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.470 align:middle line:10%
capabilities, and an
output of that company.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.110 align:middle line:10%
Those have fallen off a
cliff as you all could know.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.700 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes, so that's what's
reflected in this red line.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.665 align:middle line:10%
The real value has
gone off a cliff.

00:10:12.665 --> 00:10:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And they
have never been further apart.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.640 align:middle line:90%
Ever-- these are records.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.553 align:middle line:84%
Even the Great Depression didn't
have this kind of disconnect.

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, this is what
I was talking about earlier.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:84%
This is where the real world
economy and the stock market.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.880 align:middle line:90%
These are two different worlds.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.280 align:middle line:84%
One is for people to
play with over there,

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.720 align:middle line:90%
and the rest is for us.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Well here's what's--

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're on a
declining one right here.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And here's
what's happened since we talked

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:36.570 align:middle line:90%
about it earlier.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Here's what's happened
since 2008, 2009.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Back then it was a
financial crisis, not just

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.400 align:middle line:90%
an economic crisis.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.658 align:middle line:84%
It was made to become
an economic crisis

00:10:45.658 --> 00:10:47.950 align:middle line:84%
because of the way we handled
the financial crisis back

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:49.930 align:middle line:90%
in 2008, 2009.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%
There we bailed
out the big banks.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And everyone
else lost their homes.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And everybody
else lost their homes.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Too big to fail.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.110 align:middle line:90%
Too big to jail.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:57.370 align:middle line:90%
That was sort of the thing.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Oh we wrote everything,
the financial institutes.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.200 align:middle line:84%
We got to-- we have to
make them have liquidity.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.240 align:middle line:84%
So what ended up
happening after that,

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.510 align:middle line:84%
instead of getting reform
together in these banks,

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.480 align:middle line:84%
we had record bonuses handed
out the next year for these guys

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.820 align:middle line:90%
to crash the economy.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And what the Fed did was lower
the interest rates so much,

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.560 align:middle line:84%
that zero interest rates has
been the rule since then.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in your audience knows
that their savings account went

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:26.360 align:middle line:90%
from 5-6% in 2000, 2002--

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: To 0-2%.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: To 0-2% to now
basically 0% since 2008, 2009.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Well what can you do
with 0% interest money?

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.587 align:middle line:90%
You can borrow it endlessly.

00:11:36.587 --> 00:11:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They can.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: They can.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.810 align:middle line:90%
We can't.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.970 align:middle line:84%
But the big companies did,
and then your financial crisis

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:84%
morphed into an
economic corruption.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: So now
the banks got backstopped

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.510 align:middle line:84%
in a corrupt way, and they
passed the corruption onto

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.880 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the productive
economy of the big businesses

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle line:90%
or corporations.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:84%
They started to borrow
money at 0 interest rate

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.520 align:middle line:84%
or near 0 interest
against the collateral

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.950 align:middle line:84%
of their own organization,
their own company,

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.450 align:middle line:90%
and buy up their own stocks.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:08.628 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they just
did with the recent COVID 19.

00:12:08.628 --> 00:12:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Trillions
of dollars in bailout.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Everyone
was saying do not allow stock

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.680 align:middle line:90%
buybacks.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Mark Cuban, who's
on Shark Tank said,

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.910 align:middle line:84%
absolutely should be
outlawed because it distorts

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.830 align:middle line:90%
an actual value of a company.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.050 align:middle line:84%
You can always jack it
up by just borrowing

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.390 align:middle line:84%
infinite amounts of money,
buying up your own stock

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.592 align:middle line:90%
and jacking up the price.

00:12:26.592 --> 00:12:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that's
a false world.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.780 align:middle line:90%
And I had it written down here--

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:34.403 align:middle line:84%
10% of the population
own 84% of the stocks.

00:12:34.403 --> 00:12:35.320 align:middle line:90%
That's the real world.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.460 align:middle line:84%
That's a separate
world from our world.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And
that's dangerous for them.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Because now for
us, the only thing

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.290 align:middle line:84%
keeping even upper
middle class Americans on

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:47.590 align:middle line:84%
is their pensions
and their 401ks.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.638 align:middle line:84%
They've got a little bit
of addiction or toe--

00:12:49.638 --> 00:12:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They have
a toe into the market.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:53.513 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: They
have a toe into the market.

00:12:53.513 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:84%
But if those pensions
dry up, literally no one

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.600 align:middle line:84%
has an incentive to
keep the stock market up

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.160 align:middle line:90%
except those 10%.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And yes they do have a lock
on a lot of the politics,

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.540 align:middle line:84%
and that's part of
the corruption too.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.060 align:middle line:84%
The policies and the
policy are serving

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.210 align:middle line:84%
the 10% on every issue
across the board--

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:11.470 align:middle line:90%
conservative, liberal.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter, on
community, on environment.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.140 align:middle line:84%
You get 80% to 90% agreement
on so many issues and no action

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.350 align:middle line:84%
is being done, because
that 10%, and more often

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.630 align:middle line:90%
the top 1/10 of 1%--

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Are represented
by the top people

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.210 align:middle line:90%
in our government.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.325 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:13:26.325 --> 00:13:29.170 align:middle line:84%
So this logjam has been
happening and building.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And now with this
epidemic coming forward,

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.310 align:middle line:84%
we're actually getting
a lot of it revealed.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, we are.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And like you say, this goes
beyond which side of politics

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:36.460 align:middle line:90%
you're on.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.387 align:middle line:90%
It's both sides.

00:13:37.387 --> 00:13:39.970 align:middle line:84%
It's the people at the top that
are dealing with these lobbies

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.860 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, with the banking
industry and Wall Street

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:43.660 align:middle line:90%
directly.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, those people
are using cultural issues

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:84%
to split us up so we don't
see the financial and economic

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.500 align:middle line:90%
aspects.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And now that's
beginning to break down.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:84%
As you see the rich
people keep getting first

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.350 align:middle line:84%
in line for
everything, even when

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:59.710 align:middle line:84%
people are desperately poor,
libertarians and progressives

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.457 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to
say, wait a minute.

00:14:01.457 --> 00:14:03.040 align:middle line:84%
they're starting
to-- they're starting

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.230 align:middle line:84%
to move closer together
and say, we actually

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.360 align:middle line:90%
have a common opponent here.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.830 align:middle line:90%
This is not healthy.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.832 align:middle line:84%
This is not what this
country stands for.

00:14:10.832 --> 00:14:12.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not what the
world stands for.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.623 align:middle line:84%
It's not what the environment's
going to accept anymore.

00:14:14.623 --> 00:14:16.165 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's not
what our spirit--

00:14:16.165 --> 00:14:18.220 align:middle line:84%
collective spirit is
going to accept anymore.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And that
I think is the most powerful

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.080 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.290 align:middle line:90%
And again--

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: That's why
I love interviewing with you,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:84%
and I love watching your
own interviews with others.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is you're bringing
forward this notion

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:90%
that it's not just pragmatic.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the history
is moving us or social.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:41.180 align:middle line:84%
It's the spirit now coming out
into this world in these very,

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.680 align:middle line:84%
very powerful, practical ways,
and we have an opening now

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.943 align:middle line:84%
to see ourselves as we've
never seen ourselves before.

00:14:46.943 --> 00:14:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's get back to what
this looks like because we're

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.140 align:middle line:90%
talking economics here, right?

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Now how do you actually
see this playing out

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.680 align:middle line:84%
with trillions of
dollars of national debt?

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: The US
dollar is the world's reserve

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.670 align:middle line:90%
currency.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.045 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Even though we've
heard for years it was going

00:15:06.045 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:84%
to fall, everybody
else is falling worse.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.923 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:15:08.923 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:84%
So the United States can
print up $10 trillion

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:90%
and give it to corporations.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.250 align:middle line:90%
And it will create an impact.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:21.040 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of money, OK.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.660 align:middle line:84%
But it basically will
cause an inflation.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.370 align:middle line:90%
It'll decrease purchasing power.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.130 align:middle line:84%
The more and more you
expand the money supply,

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.380 align:middle line:84%
especially if you're just
creating it out of thin air,

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:84%
you've got more dollars
chasing fewer things.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:38.375 align:middle line:84%
So generally that
causes an inflation.

00:15:38.375 --> 00:15:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But can you have
an inflationary period during

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.720 align:middle line:90%
a recession and a depression?

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: I think it's
going to make money irrelevant.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:47.695 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, interesting.

00:15:47.695 --> 00:15:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: I think it's
going to actually throw us

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:51.940 align:middle line:84%
into a situation where
the money itself,

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.770 align:middle line:90%
the authority behind money--

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.840 align:middle line:84%
since there's no gold
behind it now anyway.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.070 align:middle line:90%
That went away in 1971.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's just
a belief system.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.523 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: It's a
belief system and the so-called

00:16:00.523 --> 00:16:02.800 align:middle line:84%
productive capacity of the
government and its citizens

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:90%
that supports it now.

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:84%
If that is going away,
if money itself--

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:14.180 align:middle line:84%
it's being lent into the
economy to create productivity

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.660 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of growth,
is now completely

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.880 align:middle line:90%
decoupled from growth.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:84%
It loses its own,
kind of, reason.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.840 align:middle line:84%
It loses its authority,
its legitimacy.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But what
does that mean, say,

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.520 align:middle line:84%
for a person who's just
graduating from college

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.210 align:middle line:90%
and starting their life?

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Well, I think
what it's going to mean is that

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.508 align:middle line:84%
these really, really high costs
for health care in particular,

00:16:40.508 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:84%
really, really high costs
for a college education

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.830 align:middle line:84%
in particular, really,
really high costs for homes.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.828 align:middle line:90%
Those are the three big ones.

00:16:47.828 --> 00:16:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Are they
going to go away?

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.700 align:middle line:90%
Are they going to be reduced?

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: I think once
the authority of money begins

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:58.120 align:middle line:84%
to collapse, and once necessity
has people moving together,

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.460 align:middle line:84%
for instance, with homes
and young people not going

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.052 align:middle line:84%
to colleges because they realize
it's kind of a boondoggle.

00:17:03.052 --> 00:17:04.510 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to have the jobs,

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and they have
skyrocketing costs.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not a good
investment anymore.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.855 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's a
conversation we could have.

00:17:09.855 --> 00:17:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Your degrees, PhD is in the
philosophy of education,

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:14.770 align:middle line:84%
and you would be
the first to say

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.180 align:middle line:90%
college is bogus for a whole--

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.401 align:middle line:90%
most sectors of young people.

00:17:18.401 --> 00:17:20.859 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Let's look
at the other one, health care.

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:23.500 align:middle line:84%
So-call health care
is actually sick-care.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.359 align:middle line:84%
So many drugs are
being poured into this,

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:28.300 align:middle line:84%
so much fear is being poured
into this to drive you

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.890 align:middle line:84%
toward drug companies,
to drive you

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:33.840 align:middle line:84%
toward palliative methods
instead of preventive

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.840 align:middle line:90%
and health care methods.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going
to drive people

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.700 align:middle line:84%
into doing their own
gardening, to go to organics,

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.560 align:middle line:84%
to realize food is
medicine, to begin

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.680 align:middle line:84%
to take care of themselves to
increase health responsibility

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.680 align:middle line:90%
and let those guys--

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.330 align:middle line:84%
the revenues
absolutely collapse.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Let colleges' revenues
absolutely collapse.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Because what they've been
doing with that kind of lending

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.640 align:middle line:90%
has been predatory.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.445 align:middle line:84%
These kids, I mean,
you're 23 years old.

00:18:00.445 --> 00:18:04.260 align:middle line:84%
That's if you don't go
into an extended degree

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.250 align:middle line:90%
into law or medicine.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.400 align:middle line:84%
These kids are stuck
with, you know, 40 to 80

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.260 align:middle line:84%
to $100,000 of debt
getting out of college.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.060 align:middle line:90%
For what?

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:17.290 align:middle line:84%
What kind of ordinary job that
a college degree will bring

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:18.332 align:middle line:90%
can ever offset that now?

00:18:18.332 --> 00:18:20.832 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And they're
waiting in line for a job that

00:18:20.832 --> 00:18:23.620 align:middle line:84%
never emerges because jobs
are actually contracting.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Things are being automated.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Even pretty high, you know,
even pretty high things

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:29.590 align:middle line:84%
like graphics, or even
computer programming

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.070 align:middle line:90%
is now becoming automated.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So you look at that, and people
start getting very nervous.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.610 align:middle line:84%
You don't get butterflies
in the stomach

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:39.320 align:middle line:84%
and think, oh my god, how am
I going to support myself?

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm young.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm just out of school.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:84%
The jobs are essentially,
as you say, contracting,

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:84%
the number of jobs
or contracting.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.600 align:middle line:84%
So this brings
across the notion of,

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.030 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of people
that were young who

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.658 align:middle line:90%
were supporting Bernie Sanders.

00:18:53.658 --> 00:18:56.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean that brought about this
huge, kind of, youth movement.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.333 align:middle line:90%
Obama did it in his day too.

00:18:58.333 --> 00:18:59.500 align:middle line:90%
This was a little different.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.540 align:middle line:84%
There was a kind of
practicality to this one.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.240 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't idealistic, as
much as it was practical.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Thinking we need to have
our health care covered.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, they
should start making

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:12.010 align:middle line:84%
these big companies responsible
for paying their own taxes.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.440 align:middle line:84%
They were really connecting
in on what's called

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:90%
democratic socialism, right.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.410 align:middle line:84%
That term scared
a lot of people.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:84%
But young people--
it didn't scare them.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.210 align:middle line:90%
They didn't baggage around it.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.340 align:middle line:90%
It meant something to them.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:84%
What do you think they were
looking to get out of that?

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And now that this has happened,
ie the Covid phenomena

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.250 align:middle line:84%
and the shut down and
slow down the economy.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.640 align:middle line:84%
What are they going to
get now out of this?

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.182 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Well first, let me,

00:19:38.182 --> 00:19:39.880 align:middle line:90%
sort of, define a couple terms.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Democratic capitalism,
as I define it

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.920 align:middle line:84%
in the book, as
money serving people

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.300 align:middle line:84%
rather than people
serving money,

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.160 align:middle line:90%
which is corrupted capitalism.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Does that get
conflated with democratic

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.030 align:middle line:90%
socialism?

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.405 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: The only
difference I make between that

00:19:52.405 --> 00:19:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and democratic socialism
is in democratic socialism

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.570 align:middle line:84%
corporations and governments
serve people rather than people

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:84%
serving corporations
and governments.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.560 align:middle line:90%
So they kind of parallel.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Democratic capitalism
really talks

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:84%
more about the money
side-- free enterprise.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And so with a vital
democratic capitalism,

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:90%
you have small business.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.290 align:middle line:84%
You have a really
active community

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.968 align:middle line:84%
and local economies
in which people really

00:20:16.968 --> 00:20:18.010 align:middle line:90%
begin to circulate money.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:19.193 align:middle line:90%
You have low currency.

00:20:19.193 --> 00:20:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Real value.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.318 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Real value.

00:20:21.318 --> 00:20:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And you'll also have
unproductive middlemen who take

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:90%
a cut, like interest brokers.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:84%
You'd have pure
lending in democratic--

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:90%
why do banks get in the middle?

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.630 align:middle line:84%
We're getting 0%
interest for our loans?

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we loan
to other people

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.847 align:middle line:84%
who are building
houses, who are trying

00:20:36.847 --> 00:20:37.930 align:middle line:90%
to support their families.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:39.550 align:middle line:90%
That's democratic capitalism.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Democratic socialism also
has a place, in my opinion.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't talk about
it much in the book,

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.140 align:middle line:84%
but it certainly has
arisen in the sense

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.390 align:middle line:84%
that government should
also, and corporations

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:50.980 align:middle line:90%
should serve the people.

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Medicare for all would
save $500 billion a year.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.810 align:middle line:84%
That's acknowledged in
scientific and sociology

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.130 align:middle line:90%
studies.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't
have the profiteering.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.680 align:middle line:84%
You eliminate that with
a single payer system.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: All the
admin, everything.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And you
incentivize preventive health

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.630 align:middle line:90%
and actual health.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in corrupted
capitalism system,

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:15.130 align:middle line:84%
you're actually
incentivizing sickness

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:16.960 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
pays the money.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.490 align:middle line:84%
It increases the
gross domestic product

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:20.970 align:middle line:90%
but in the wrong kind of way.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.668 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I was going to say,
the way to-- and they don't do

00:21:23.668 --> 00:21:25.960 align:middle line:84%
this because they don't make
this distinction and gross

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.510 align:middle line:84%
national product or
gross domestic product--

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:31.480 align:middle line:84%
distinguish between the parts
of gross domestic product that

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.150 align:middle line:84%
increase the health of people
and the parts of it that

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:37.490 align:middle line:84%
actually diminish or damage
the health of people.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And then that's your
real financial health

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.965 align:middle line:90%
and economic health of a nation.

00:21:41.965 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:84%
If you just throw
it all together

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.798 align:middle line:84%
and say, doesn't matter what
kind of money you're spending,

00:21:45.798 --> 00:21:47.360 align:middle line:84%
this is how much
we're spending--

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.230 align:middle line:90%
that's not good.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:50.635 align:middle line:84%
We want to spend less on
the things that damage us,

00:21:50.635 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and more on the things
that enhance us.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:55.213 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, it seems
like if we had already had,

00:21:55.213 --> 00:21:57.380 align:middle line:84%
for example-- and these
aren't political statements.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.005 align:middle line:84%
We're just looking
at where we are now.

00:21:59.005 --> 00:22:02.420 align:middle line:84%
If we had had Medicare
for all already in place,

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.610 align:middle line:84%
when something-- like
other countries did--

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:07.700 align:middle line:84%
when something like
a pandemic hits.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Without even getting into any of
the politics of that or whether

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.380 align:middle line:84%
it was right to close
it to that extent

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.180 align:middle line:84%
or for how long--
forget all that.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.370 align:middle line:84%
If we had that in
place, whereas you

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:22.460 align:middle line:84%
say the emphasis is on health
and prevention of illness,

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.400 align:middle line:84%
how much better would
a country fare just

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:30.260 align:middle line:84%
by having that system in place
for any kind of future pandemic

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.190 align:middle line:90%
or epidemics?

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:32.398 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Absolutely.

00:22:32.398 --> 00:22:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Just in the administration
alone and the ability

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.850 align:middle line:84%
to mobilize nationally
in a coordinated way

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:40.940 align:middle line:84%
as we saw a disaster
happening in our country,

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.470 align:middle line:90%
it would pay huge dividends.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Because all those
resources, institutions,

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.890 align:middle line:84%
research institutions
would be linked

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:50.955 align:middle line:90%
to serve a system broadly.

00:22:50.955 --> 00:22:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And it would have
basically one and not

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.163 align:middle line:84%
all these little
teeny bits of plants.

00:22:54.163 --> 00:22:56.310 align:middle line:90%
Collecting data would be easy.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.310 align:middle line:84%
But the other part that
doesn't get talked about

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.690 align:middle line:90%
is a preventive aspect.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We need to learn
to take care of our immune

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:03.140 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:05.182 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Who are
at the highest at risk?

00:23:05.182 --> 00:23:07.520 align:middle line:84%
We have an overwhelming
obesity epidemic

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.960 align:middle line:90%
in this country right now.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Here and
England and Australia.

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:12.900 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And they were
one of the greatest at risk.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:84%
We have an overwhelming
diabetes too,

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.150 align:middle line:84%
which can be solved almost
entirely with good diet, which

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.663 align:middle line:84%
I don't encourage and neither
does the medical profession

00:23:19.663 --> 00:23:21.830 align:middle line:84%
because they make money off
of sick people and drugs

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:22.640 align:middle line:90%
to treat diabetes.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.348 align:middle line:84%
They don't make it
off the healthy people

00:23:24.348 --> 00:23:26.090 align:middle line:90%
who don't need their drugs.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.110 align:middle line:90%
And it goes on and on.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:28.985 align:middle line:84%
Those are the people
that are most affected--

00:23:28.985 --> 00:23:31.550 align:middle line:84%
not just by COVID 19, but any
future pandemic and pretty

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:32.687 align:middle line:90%
much any other disease.

00:23:32.687 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well let's
get into another part,

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and this has to do with again
the corrupted capitalism around

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.770 align:middle line:84%
medical insurance in
general, and around this.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:43.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the fear-- what people
had so much fear around it,

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:45.383 align:middle line:90%
rather than being--

00:23:45.383 --> 00:23:47.300 align:middle line:84%
first of all, we didn't
have enough knowledge.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.425 align:middle line:84%
We still don't have enough
knowledge on what it is,

00:23:49.425 --> 00:23:50.240 align:middle line:90%
how it acts.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Can it come back, and so forth?

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And so people tended to not
take care of themselves.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.765 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these people
didn't take care of themselves,

00:23:57.765 --> 00:23:59.390 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes because
they couldn't afford

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.005 align:middle line:84%
to go to the hospital
and others out of fear.

00:24:02.005 --> 00:24:04.130 align:middle line:84%
But we've learned recently
that, for example, there

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.350 align:middle line:84%
was an increase
in people arriving

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:11.270 align:middle line:84%
at hospitals dead on arrival,
right, from heart conditions,

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:12.070 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:14.487 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Because they
were afraid they would have

00:24:14.487 --> 00:24:16.010 align:middle line:84%
to pay and it would
bankrupt them.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And now you're putting
the health of your kids,

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.870 align:middle line:84%
the ability to eat, the
ability to heat your home

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.235 align:middle line:84%
or cool your home
up and against--

00:24:23.235 --> 00:24:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Your life.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Your
life going to a hospital.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.400 align:middle line:90%
That should never be the case.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Never.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.540 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes so now other countries--

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Germany has fared fairly well
for a variety of reasons.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.000 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to get
into all of them.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.640 align:middle line:84%
But one of them is they
have a different way

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.050 align:middle line:90%
of seeing their populace.

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And during the COVID pandemic,
rather than just having people

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:50.090 align:middle line:84%
tossed off of their jobs when
everything came to a halt,

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:53.750 align:middle line:84%
the government subsidized
them for the employers

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:56.210 align:middle line:84%
to keep their employees
on the payroll.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.110 align:middle line:90%
So they continued their income.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:01.670 align:middle line:84%
They could continue a certain
amount of normal consumption

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:05.230 align:middle line:84%
so they didn't have to grind
to a total halt anyway.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're only experiencing
at this point in time

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:14.240 align:middle line:84%
a relatively minor drop in
the GDP and everything else.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.280 align:middle line:90%
Where we're tanking.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're going to be
circling the toilet bowl.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And
we're taking even more

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.250 align:middle line:84%
because we're not recognizing
in the stock market.

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.275 align:middle line:84%
We act like that's the
economy, and it's not.

00:25:26.275 --> 00:25:27.650 align:middle line:84%
So people aren't
paying attention

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:28.650 align:middle line:90%
to what's going on here.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:31.108 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: The electronic
jolt that someone's trying

00:25:31.108 --> 00:25:33.650 align:middle line:84%
to get someone's heart
started back is being mistaken

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:37.410 align:middle line:90%
for a leap in the economy.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what these
multi-trillion dollar subsidies

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.720 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, they are
not something that's

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.930 align:middle line:90%
actually repairing the economy.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.915 align:middle line:90%
They're simply treas.

00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:51.290 align:middle line:84%
They're the same
as those paddles

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:54.040 align:middle line:84%
that they've rub together and
try to get your heart started.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's important to get
your heart started, otherwise

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.000 align:middle line:84%
your economy is
really toast, but it's

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:84%
not a long term plan for
economic health or economic--

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The things underneath
that the economy has to be,

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.610 align:middle line:84%
the people have
to be taking care,

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:12.160 align:middle line:84%
or allowed to have some kind of
graceful survival in this whole

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:12.960 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.677 align:middle line:84%
So one thing you've
talked about now--

00:26:14.677 --> 00:26:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Germany, for example is
announced they're formally

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.290 align:middle line:90%
in a recession.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Other countries are going
to-- already in a recession

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:23.000 align:middle line:90%
and slipping into depression.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Our country debatably we may be
going into the latter category.

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:28.063 align:middle line:84%
We will see how this plays
out over the next nine months

00:26:28.063 --> 00:26:29.780 align:middle line:90%
to a year or so.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Now when we look at that,
people are comparing it

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.980 align:middle line:90%
to the Great Depression.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I know that you've
looked at tons of graphs.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.470 align:middle line:84%
You look at every kind of
graph, and you've looked

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.240 align:middle line:90%
at how these track each other.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And they can look very
similar on paper, on a graph.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.830 align:middle line:84%
However, compared to what might
become a depression this time

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:50.050 align:middle line:90%
around, it's not the same.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:51.670 align:middle line:84%
What is different
that's in place?

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Even though we say we
have no real safety

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.860 align:middle line:84%
nets compared to some
of the European nations

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.370 align:middle line:90%
and other nations.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:59.590 align:middle line:90%
It is different.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:01.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
affect us to the degree

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.712 align:middle line:84%
that the Great
Depression did, right?

00:27:03.712 --> 00:27:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS:
I don't think so.

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:06.790 align:middle line:84%
My assessment is
that people aren't

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:07.990 align:middle line:90%
going to largely go hungry.

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And I even said in the book
way back when I wrote it,

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and it's only proving to
be true more and more,

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:16.510 align:middle line:84%
that I thought if
there are violence,

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.820 align:middle line:84%
there would be
pockets of violence.

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:19.953 align:middle line:90%
The big shift--

00:27:19.953 --> 00:27:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Sleeping from
violence to that, you mean,

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.440 align:middle line:90%
because people are starving.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Literally, they don't
have money for food.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:25.897 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Resentful.

00:27:25.897 --> 00:27:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Or angry.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Or angry that
they're not getting bailed out,

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and other people are
getting bailed out.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And then they're going
to feel entitled,

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.417 align:middle line:84%
perhaps to say listen,
I'm going to take

00:27:33.417 --> 00:27:35.350 align:middle line:84%
some of that stuff I
should have gotten.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.850 align:middle line:90%
So you know, I think that--

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:40.510 align:middle line:84%
but I also see as a much
stronger possibility

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:44.200 align:middle line:84%
this radical localization and
decentralization of economies

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.100 align:middle line:90%
into communities.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:48.220 align:middle line:84%
What we saw, even
in our community

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.770 align:middle line:84%
in the foothills,
the Sierra foothills,

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.680 align:middle line:84%
was that people were
doing exactly that.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:58.060 align:middle line:84%
There was a huge rush to the
local nursery to get plants.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Unbelievable,
suburban and rural,

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.020 align:middle line:84%
and now even urban gardening
is becoming a big thing.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Where people are
deciding, hey, you're

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.262 align:middle line:84%
going back to the Jeffersonian,
Thomas Jefferson roots.

00:28:07.262 --> 00:28:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And saying, we need to
be more self-sufficient.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.345 align:middle line:90%
We can't have food deserts.

00:28:10.345 --> 00:28:12.352 align:middle line:84%
We have to be able
to grow our own food.

00:28:12.352 --> 00:28:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And then when we grow our own
food, we have respect for it,

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:16.000 align:middle line:90%
and it can be organic.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And we can trade
it with neighbors

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that
we're not hungry.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.970 align:middle line:90%
This isn't just a utopian dream.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:22.105 align:middle line:90%


00:28:22.105 --> 00:28:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: No.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:22.950 align:middle line:90%
It actually is happening.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is
practical and happening.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:30.220 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned in another show
that during this whole shutdown,

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.320 align:middle line:84%
it was looking
like a black Friday

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.290 align:middle line:84%
sale at the local nurseries
virtually every day.

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:36.220 align:middle line:90%
They were so packed.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Home Depot and the nurseries.

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:39.490 align:middle line:84%
With people wanting
to get on it.

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Get their vegetable garden
planted for the spring,

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.160 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Now in those times--

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.550 align:middle line:84%
well I think one thing to note
too that in the United States,

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.820 align:middle line:84%
this is possible for a huge
percentage of the population.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.270 align:middle line:84%
If you're not in a very densely
packed urban area like New York

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.970 align:middle line:84%
City, for example,
you usually have

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:00.940 align:middle line:84%
a little patch of land nearby
or for a community garden,

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.610 align:middle line:84%
or even a little patch of your
own land in the front or back.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.080 align:middle line:90%
You can do these things.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
basic and essential.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:11.478 align:middle line:84%
We can grow our own food,
and now it's becoming clear

00:29:11.478 --> 00:29:12.770 align:middle line:90%
that people are ready to do it.

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:15.342 align:middle line:84%
It took something to
jolt us into this part

00:29:15.342 --> 00:29:16.300 align:middle line:90%
of our self-sufficient.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.383 align:middle line:10%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And once
people taste that life,

00:29:18.383 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:10%
getting their hands in the
soil, all those good microbes

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.760 align:middle line:10%
and viruses that we've been kept
from because we use triclosan

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.960 align:middle line:10%
or some kind of
bactericidal soap,

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.060 align:middle line:10%
and we never really expose
ourselves to the good stuff,

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.480 align:middle line:10%
starts to begin to come back.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And we start to develop a
connection with the sun,

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.260 align:middle line:84%
because we're out
in the sun weeding.

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:38.740 align:middle line:84%
We're out in the sun you know
trimming these fruit trees.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
we're beginning

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:45.380 align:middle line:84%
to recall now, wait a minute,
this is the good life.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Compare this to the burying
your house, you know.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:51.200 align:middle line:84%
When it's a perfectly
nice day outside,

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.080 align:middle line:84%
we see now families
walking consistently.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Bike riders going in ways that
are much, much more frequent.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're also
starting to see right before

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:03.080 align:middle line:84%
this shut down, there was an
increase in people getting

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:07.220 align:middle line:84%
together, like in coffee shops
and such, even in the evenings,

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:08.390 align:middle line:90%
playing games.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Bringing cards and board games--
not with their kids even,

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:12.610 align:middle line:90%
but kids too.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:16.460 align:middle line:84%
This, kind of, very kind of back
to the 50s and 60s in a sense.

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:20.350 align:middle line:84%
When people were
craving company with one

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:22.160 align:middle line:90%
another and engagement.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is just kind of a fun
lighthearted way to engage.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.320 align:middle line:84%
We're already seeing
a pickup in that,

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.655 align:middle line:90%
so this has driven it further.

00:30:27.655 --> 00:30:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: We've
needed that contrast.

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And we needed a
really sharp shut down

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.260 align:middle line:90%
for that to come to fruition.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it would have
happened in a gradual way.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:41.188 align:middle line:84%
So one of the great gifts
of this and the shutdowns

00:30:41.188 --> 00:30:43.480 align:middle line:84%
associated with-- whether
you agree with it politically

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.580 align:middle line:90%
or not, as it's economic.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.550 align:middle line:84%
From a spiritual standpoint,
from an emotional standpoint,

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:51.820 align:middle line:84%
from a mental health
standpoint, and definitely

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.970 align:middle line:84%
from a cooperative social
and community standpoint,

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:59.590 align:middle line:84%
it was absolutely critical
that we basically made

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:05.260 align:middle line:84%
to stop cold turkey and engage
in reflection and silence

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.150 align:middle line:90%
and stillness for a time.

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people then started
to go out into the gardens.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Started to then get
on Zoom or other,

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.490 align:middle line:84%
you know, forms to
speak with their family.

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, this is
the silver lining of it.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.220 align:middle line:84%
I think looking at another
part that people may not

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.813 align:middle line:84%
consider a silver lining,
some of these businesses

00:31:23.813 --> 00:31:24.730 align:middle line:90%
are not going to open.

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.770 align:middle line:84%
A good percentage
will not reopen.

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, if
you're a small business

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:30.912 align:middle line:84%
and say you have a hair
salon, you can do it at home.

00:31:30.912 --> 00:31:32.620 align:middle line:84%
You can take your
stuff to people's homes

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and do their hair
from their homes.

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:35.710 align:middle line:90%
You can continue going.

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:39.820 align:middle line:84%
It may not look like you
thought it was going to look.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:43.000 align:middle line:84%
In our neighborhood, a
lady is doing all her dog

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.805 align:middle line:84%
grooming from her
garage on weekends.

00:31:44.805 --> 00:31:47.770 align:middle line:84%
She has a day job but
she loves animals.

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of this office
space and commercial space

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:54.290 align:middle line:90%
is going to start going vacant.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, let's look
at what happens over time

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:01.090 align:middle line:90%
when office space goes vacant.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:05.140 align:middle line:84%
When malls start having
a lot of vacancies.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.120 align:middle line:84%
When people realize that
their income has been reduced

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to have to
maybe, you know, move back--

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.820 align:middle line:90%
maybe families will combine.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, siblings
and their families

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:16.600 align:middle line:84%
can move into one
larger house together.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are creative
solutions that have always

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:22.240 align:middle line:84%
been employed in other
cultures and we're

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.730 align:middle line:84%
going to have to get creative
that way in the West as

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:25.540 align:middle line:90%
well now.

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: We are.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Ours, especially
the United States,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.690 align:middle line:84%
is a risk taking individualism
to create something

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:35.890 align:middle line:84%
that, some new invention or some
massive success multi-million

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:39.430 align:middle line:84%
dollar app you can sell to a
multi-billion dollar company.

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And that was the notion
of continual expansion--

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:43.360 align:middle line:90%
more, more, more.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Move away from other people.

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:46.820 align:middle line:90%
Be the highest percent--

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:47.455 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: More individualistic.

00:32:47.455 --> 00:32:49.205 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Be
more individualistic.

00:32:49.205 --> 00:32:50.860 align:middle line:90%
Get your own house.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.320 align:middle line:84%
You've somehow failed unless
you had your own house

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.450 align:middle line:90%
and you owned your own house.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And now so much of
that is coming back

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:58.617 align:middle line:90%
to the other direction.

00:32:58.617 --> 00:33:00.450 align:middle line:84%
That's going to create
a lot of opportunity.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:03.250 align:middle line:84%
It's going to create
a lot of contraction.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:05.680 align:middle line:84%
So on the real world, it's
actually going to open up,

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.597 align:middle line:84%
I think, some serious
opportunities for people

00:33:07.597 --> 00:33:10.510 align:middle line:84%
to be solvent, and
to free up time.

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Because they're slaving
away two families.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.410 align:middle line:84%
If you compare what
happened the early 70s,

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:17.590 align:middle line:84%
one middle class family could
have one full time worker,

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:19.778 align:middle line:90%
and could easily support--

00:33:19.778 --> 00:33:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A mortgage,
a car payment.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Food, the mortgage,

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and a college
education for the kids.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Now with two full time
working, sometimes

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.100 align:middle line:84%
working more than
one job, you can't

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.543 align:middle line:90%
afford all of those things.

00:33:29.543 --> 00:33:30.710 align:middle line:90%
Where did all that money go?

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:34.970 align:middle line:84%
It was being skimmed off through
all these financial mechanisms.

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And now it's gotten to
its logical conclusion,

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:39.990 align:middle line:90%
and you can't do it anymore.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:43.250 align:middle line:84%
It's collapsing back, and we're
beginning to find out it never

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:44.412 align:middle line:90%
benefited us really anyway.

00:33:44.412 --> 00:33:46.370 align:middle line:84%
The stocks are owned by
a very small percentage

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:47.960 align:middle line:90%
of the population.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.743 align:middle line:84%
We were churning out
our productivity,

00:33:49.743 --> 00:33:51.410 align:middle line:84%
and all the graphs
will show you, again,

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:54.350 align:middle line:84%
that productivity skyrocketed,
but our actual wages

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.480 align:middle line:84%
were flat during
that whole time.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So the difference of
that was being skimmed.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And now we're like,
hey, why don't we

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.990 align:middle line:84%
use our own productivity
with each other?

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.540 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we lend to each other?

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we move in together?

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:09.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, that certificate-- if
I don't get it from a college,

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.510 align:middle line:90%
I'll still be able to learn.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.880 align:middle line:84%
I'll still be able to
have a meaningful craft.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:17.389 align:middle line:84%
So we're now empowered
as individuals.

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Because they said you
need our certificate.

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:23.090 align:middle line:84%
You need our stamp of prestige
or you haven't made it.

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And now we're realizing
it's a bit of a boondoggle,

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:27.560 align:middle line:84%
and we can come back
out of that and start

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:28.828 align:middle line:90%
creating our own value.

00:34:28.828 --> 00:34:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's a matter of also
re-establishing now our self

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:35.179 align:middle line:84%
identity, because we've gotten
used to those ways in which

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:37.250 align:middle line:90%
our ego has seen itself.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Yes, absolutely.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now to become a
little more humble and say, OK,

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.960 align:middle line:84%
that part actually
don't see it as defeat.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.080 align:middle line:84%
That part isn't
working for me anymore.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.219 align:middle line:84%
Now it's time to
change the game.

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Hey, my sister and her
husband are doing fine.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.989 align:middle line:84%
They've got a couple
extra bedrooms.

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I can go there,
pitch in on the rent.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:00.860 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, families can
even buy a home together.

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the developments
has been in the last decade

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:07.460 align:middle line:84%
is multiple family
housing, which

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.970 align:middle line:84%
has a central area,
central kitchen

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:12.260 align:middle line:84%
but can house two different
families in one house.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily a duplex,
but one largish house.

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:17.870 align:middle line:90%
You can have meals together.

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:20.630 align:middle line:84%
You can buy things together
in bulk that save you money.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:22.190 align:middle line:90%
There are so many things.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.953 align:middle line:84%
And we've been, kind of,
propagandized against that

00:35:25.953 --> 00:35:27.620 align:middle line:84%
because there's
something wrong with you

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:28.550 align:middle line:90%
if you have to move in.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.980 align:middle line:84%
There's something wrong with
you if you live cooperatively.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.270 align:middle line:84%
There's something--
and all of a sudden,

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:33.918 align:middle line:84%
we're beginning to
say, wait a minute,

00:35:33.918 --> 00:35:35.460 align:middle line:84%
that makes sense
for the environment.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.980 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense for our budget.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.490 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense for the world.

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:39.860 align:middle line:90%
We have a more intimate thing.

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.170 align:middle line:90%
If I want to go out--

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:43.340 align:middle line:84%
if you and I want to go
out, we have children

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.200 align:middle line:84%
and we have a family
is living with us,

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.910 align:middle line:84%
they just go with
the other family.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:48.870 align:middle line:90%
No babysitting necessary.

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:50.840 align:middle line:84%
So we're beginning
to discover, wait,

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.120 align:middle line:84%
a good life is one where
we have the freedom

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:56.300 align:middle line:84%
to do things we want to do,
rather than always putting them

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.500 align:middle line:90%
off.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And then to live the
kind of life that

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:00.465 align:middle line:84%
will allow us to
do the things we

00:36:00.465 --> 00:36:02.510 align:middle line:84%
want to do rather
than putting them off.

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So where is this
spiritual opportunity here

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:09.510 align:middle line:84%
in economic contraction to bring
people literally back in houses

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:10.310 align:middle line:90%
together?

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Extended family,
where they've been

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:14.150 align:middle line:84%
able to afford to get away from
each other for a few decades.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: It's
going to mature us.

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:18.085 align:middle line:84%
It's going to help us be more
forgiving and more graceful

00:36:18.085 --> 00:36:19.680 align:middle line:90%
by necessity.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
side too, this COVID

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:23.700 align:middle line:84%
has also forced
people in houses that

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.260 align:middle line:84%
don't belong together,
in abusive relationships

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.060 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.040 align:middle line:84%
But we never heard
about those people

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.260 align:middle line:84%
because we were in
our individual houses

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.820 align:middle line:90%
and our own individual lives.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.520 align:middle line:84%
As we collapse together and
realize how more interdependent

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.420 align:middle line:84%
we are, we will become more
aware of those people who truly

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:41.250 align:middle line:84%
need help, rather
than shipping it off

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:44.710 align:middle line:84%
on some institution or some
nonprofit to take care of it.

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:46.590 align:middle line:84%
We will start taking
responsibility

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:49.200 align:middle line:84%
to begin to protect and become
aware of the people who are not

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.590 align:middle line:90%
being treated properly.

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And we will have
them be able to move

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:54.820 align:middle line:84%
into healthier
environments as well.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So on both sides,
both on the removal

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:01.170 align:middle line:84%
and having too much
money, right, and having

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:05.610 align:middle line:84%
it, quote, too good, and not
allowing yourself to bring it

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:08.040 align:middle line:84%
back into the importance
of relationship,

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.450 align:middle line:84%
we'll also be addressing
the other side as well.

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That kind of
creates a spiritual maturity.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And having to be
where you are, you

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.130 align:middle line:84%
see where your own
buttons are being pushed,

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:19.140 align:middle line:84%
what's going on spiritually,
psychologically,

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.000 align:middle line:90%
emotionally with other people.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it gives us a
chance in a fast track order

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:27.980 align:middle line:84%
really to come back together and
to first learn about ourselves.

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And
that's a good thing.

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:29.820 align:middle line:90%


00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:30.615 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What we're
bringing to the table.

00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:30.990 align:middle line:90%


00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: That's a good
thing you interviewed Calleman,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.020 align:middle line:90%
Carl Calleman.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.420 align:middle line:84%
He talked about that
regime is falling.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And what that regime is, is
this Western individualistic,

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:41.130 align:middle line:90%
materialist regime.

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:44.010 align:middle line:84%
What is better for spiritual
growth than the collapse

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:46.290 align:middle line:90%
of a materialist regime?

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Patriarchal.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And
the patriarchal regime,

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:50.190 align:middle line:84%
where everyone is
propagandized--

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We don't
need strong man.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The
strong man dictators.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.338 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Give up a
responsibility to someone else.

00:37:56.338 --> 00:37:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Give your life over to
someone else for making money

00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.650 align:middle line:90%
for someone else.

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:02.378 align:middle line:84%
That's what we've been taught
for the last 400 years.

00:38:02.378 --> 00:38:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well arguably,
even before that,

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:06.260 align:middle line:84%
but certainly since
industrialization.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.228 align:middle line:84%
Patriarchy has lasted
thousands of years.

00:38:08.228 --> 00:38:11.880 align:middle line:84%
But the last iteration of it,
of scientific materialism,

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:16.180 align:middle line:84%
of industrialism, of
colonialism, of paternalism--

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: All moves away from
spirit, away from intuition,

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:24.600 align:middle line:84%
away from heart, community,
care, the feminine.

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Now we are being forced
back into embracing

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.820 align:middle line:90%
of the feminine strengths.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And there is no
greater-- you can

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:37.200 align:middle line:84%
be as politically correct as you
want, it will not make a dent.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.740 align:middle line:84%
But being forced into caring
and actually embracing

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.627 align:middle line:84%
as a necessity, and
also something--

00:38:42.627 --> 00:38:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's beautiful.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: You want
for yourself is the best way

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.050 align:middle line:84%
to bring the feminine
attributes forward.

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And now how long
would that have taken us if we

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.220 align:middle line:84%
weren't simply ground to a
halt and have it stuffed right

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:54.053 align:middle line:90%
in our faces, right?

00:38:54.053 --> 00:38:55.137 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:38:55.137 --> 00:38:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It could
have taken millennia,

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.120 align:middle line:84%
another hundreds of years for
us to finally get this one.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.370 align:middle line:84%
That's what I see is
the beauty in this.

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So now, in terms
of rebuilding here,

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.230 align:middle line:90%
you talk about the three C's--

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:09.980 align:middle line:90%
cash, coin, and community.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And let's also get into the
notion of debt forgiveness

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:13.430 align:middle line:84%
while we're at it,
because there's

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.180 align:middle line:84%
going to have to be
some of that, period.

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: When you can
no longer expand like we have

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:21.000 align:middle line:84%
for all the reasons--
environmental reasons,

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.370 align:middle line:84%
or the fact that we just
have contraction of jobs.

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Or the fact that all
of this is funny money,

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and it's not based
in anything real.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:31.170 align:middle line:84%
When we finally become
real with all this,

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:34.320 align:middle line:84%
we realize it's a lot
smaller than we think.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Then we have to reassess,
it's not going to be growth.

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Growth is not to
create value here.

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:39.870 align:middle line:90%
So what is?

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:42.450 align:middle line:90%
I would say depth.

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Depth and connection is
going to create value.

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:49.110 align:middle line:84%
I talk in my book about
moving from capital

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:51.210 align:middle line:84%
to relationship capital,
like money capital

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:52.530 align:middle line:90%
to relationship capital.

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:55.650 align:middle line:84%
I also talk in my book about
going from a possession

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:58.950 align:middle line:84%
oriented, which is
materialist, right, material

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:04.450 align:middle line:84%
society to a non-possession
or experience based

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:06.060 align:middle line:90%
non-material society.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.490 align:middle line:84%
The thing that is beautiful
about non-material goods--

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:15.330 align:middle line:84%
care, connection, gratitude,
spirituality in all its forms,

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:16.600 align:middle line:90%
is that it's non-scarce.

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:20.070 align:middle line:84%
It actually multiplies
the more you share it.

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:22.650 align:middle line:84%
In our current materialist
objectified world,

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:23.490 align:middle line:90%
it diminishes.

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.728 align:middle line:90%
The more it's shared, the less--

00:40:25.728 --> 00:40:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You feel diminished.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.718 align:middle line:90%
The less scarce it is--

00:40:28.718 --> 00:40:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's a take away.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: The
less valuable it is.

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Not good.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS:
In this new world,

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:36.330 align:middle line:90%
these goods are all non-scarce.

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You're right.

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Because the suffering
that we've had for so many

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:42.580 align:middle line:84%
years has really been due to
the poverty of our relationships

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:43.380 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: It is.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And then we're
tying that poverty

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:50.520 align:middle line:84%
to value we invest
in finite goods.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.470 align:middle line:90%
This is infinite.

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:55.500 align:middle line:84%
We can grow
infinitely, but only in

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.780 align:middle line:90%
non-material, non-scarce goods.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.060 align:middle line:90%
So why not make that our growth?

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Bhutan talks
about gross national happiness.

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:05.585 align:middle line:84%
That's a canary in
the coal mine, right.

00:41:05.585 --> 00:41:06.960 align:middle line:84%
That's where we
need to be going.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Instead of gross
national product,

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:middle line:84%
we need to go to gross
national happiness.

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Where our physical, mental,
social, psychological,

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.480 align:middle line:84%
spiritual, emotional health
and the growth of that,

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and the deepening of that is
what constitutes the new GNP.

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, I agree.

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's, I think,
the hope in all of this

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.030 align:middle line:84%
is that we can find
our way to it that once

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:32.520 align:middle line:84%
we get through the pitfalls
of what's coming up.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the things you
say, you said when you wrote

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.210 align:middle line:84%
the book, but also now appears
that it might be more real

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:42.450 align:middle line:84%
is that people may just
stop paying taxes in mass.

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Massive numbers of
people stop paying taxes.

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:46.430 align:middle line:90%
Then what happens?

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:51.780 align:middle line:84%
What happens on a local level
and beyond to national levels

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.340 align:middle line:84%
if people stop
paying their taxes

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.930 align:middle line:84%
due to a certain
amount of poverty

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:56.110 align:middle line:90%
going through the country?

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:56.397 align:middle line:90%


00:41:56.397 --> 00:41:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: You
could even do, I mean,

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:00.605 align:middle line:84%
I think there will be some
people that simply say listen,

00:42:00.605 --> 00:42:01.950 align:middle line:90%
my taxes are being abused.

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:03.300 align:middle line:90%
It's for corrupt purposes.

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:04.350 align:middle line:90%
I refuse.

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:07.200 align:middle line:84%
But you could even stop
short of that legally.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.480 align:middle line:84%
You literally can
move in together

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:14.550 align:middle line:84%
and do bartering, trade, and
have your actual taxable salary

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:17.712 align:middle line:84%
be so low that you don't
have to pay taxes on it.

00:42:17.712 --> 00:42:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So once the tax
revenue's no longer there,

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.630 align:middle line:84%
do you have a Draconian building
department, for example?

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: No.

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:26.987 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You have to pay
$30,000 for a permit to have

00:42:26.987 --> 00:42:27.945 align:middle line:90%
a trailer on your land?

00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: No,
bureaucracy and technocracies

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:34.880 align:middle line:84%
are going to be forced to
also contract seriously.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.390 align:middle line:84%
They're basically,
they were foot soldiers

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:39.265 align:middle line:84%
for this elite,
this one percent.

00:42:39.265 --> 00:42:41.870 align:middle line:90%


00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And they were also
reliable voters

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:47.710 align:middle line:84%
for the cities and political
machines that were paying them.

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:49.600 align:middle line:84%
If that goes away,
then there has

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.900 align:middle line:84%
to be a new basis of value,
a new basis of power.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.560 align:middle line:90%
And so that's going to be--

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.540 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be
an interesting thing.

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly
what's going to happen.

00:42:57.410 --> 00:43:01.753 align:middle line:84%
But with fewer tax revenues,
say steeply reduced tax revenue,

00:43:01.753 --> 00:43:03.170 align:middle line:84%
technocracy,
bureaucrats are going

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:05.140 align:middle line:90%
to have to seriously contract.

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Gavin Newsom already
is contracting,

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:09.320 align:middle line:90%
I think, 10% just recently--

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: For the
government agencies.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.918 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Yep, for payroll.

00:43:12.918 --> 00:43:14.620 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
continue to accelerate.

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.720 align:middle line:84%
These bloated pensions
are going to dry up and be

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.370 align:middle line:90%
a lot, lot smaller.

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to force everyone
into a much more community

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.770 align:middle line:90%
based way of getting along.

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not going to come
from some distant institution.

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.170 align:middle line:84%
You said in this cash
coining community,

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:31.803 align:middle line:90%
we've got the community part.

00:43:31.803 --> 00:43:33.220 align:middle line:84%
What about the
cash and coin part?

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:34.280 align:middle line:90%
What's that mean?

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Things
don't change overnight.

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:39.650 align:middle line:84%
To me, I look, just as a
person who's pragmatic, grew up

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:40.450 align:middle line:90%
in the Midwest.

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And I
noticed with you and I,

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:47.170 align:middle line:84%
the things that matter
that really hold value from

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:50.020 align:middle line:84%
an objective standpoint,
and there still are objects

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:54.790 align:middle line:84%
of value, our arable land
that is cultivatable land.

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:57.520 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, still
the US government's

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:01.210 align:middle line:84%
dollars, just because we're
still the world's reserve

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:07.800 align:middle line:84%
currency, and that would
be cash and then coin.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.020 align:middle line:84%
By coin, I just think
of gold and silver.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And some people have
asked, well is it Bitcoin?

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.780 align:middle line:84%
I like what Mark Blyth said
about this, economic Mark

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:16.960 align:middle line:90%
Blyth.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:17.830 align:middle line:90%
He's a contrarian.

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said, listen, I
think Bitcoin is largely

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.110 align:middle line:90%
a figment of imagination.

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:25.250 align:middle line:90%
It says you can't store it.

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:28.070 align:middle line:84%
You can't exchange
it for the most part.

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:34.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, its value in a
normal real world sense

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:35.207 align:middle line:90%
isn't well established.

00:44:35.207 --> 00:44:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, it's
certainly vulnerable

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.980 align:middle line:90%
and volatile.

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.700 align:middle line:84%
So right now at
this period of time

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:44.040 align:middle line:84%
going into a recession,
possibly a depression,

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.690 align:middle line:84%
we want things that are
simple that you can rely on,

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:50.232 align:middle line:84%
that are understood,
that are transferable.

00:44:50.232 --> 00:44:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right, yep.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Whether it's
oversized zucchinis or cash,

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:54.930 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: , Exactly and
gold and silver in this case.

00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:58.723 align:middle line:90%
And gold and silver.

00:44:58.723 --> 00:45:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So that, still in your
opinion, will have some value.

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: It does
because it's had historical

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:03.390 align:middle line:90%
value.

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:04.973 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And when
people are scared,

00:45:04.973 --> 00:45:07.250 align:middle line:84%
you want something that
has some historical value.

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes, but it--

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Familiarity.

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes, but
it also has another thing.

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:13.290 align:middle line:84%
When we were taken off the gold
standard and silver standard

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:18.020 align:middle line:84%
to back money, we essentially
went into the Twilight Zone.

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:21.380 align:middle line:84%
My money was now
controllable by elites

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.672 align:middle line:90%
because it had no anchor.

00:45:23.672 --> 00:45:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
going to be both

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:28.580 align:middle line:84%
a nostalgic and a practical
turn back to gold and silver

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:32.720 align:middle line:84%
as a basis for or
community exchange itself.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Zucchinis in local currency,
local dollars and services

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.580 align:middle line:84%
because that allows it to
be tethered to something

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.890 align:middle line:84%
that's not under
the manipulation

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:44.850 align:middle line:90%
and mandate of someone else.

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:47.270 align:middle line:90%
No, that makes total sense.

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Another thing you talk about
is radical decentralization.

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Explain
what that means and--

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:56.168 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Well
we're already seeing it.

00:45:56.168 --> 00:45:58.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look just from
the physical requirements

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.088 align:middle line:90%
of quarantining.

00:46:00.088 --> 00:46:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Our community is
beginning to open up

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:04.600 align:middle line:84%
where we are because everyone's
been shut down for a few weeks,

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:08.020 align:middle line:84%
enough to have the
so-called coronaviruses

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.830 align:middle line:90%
symptoms to run through.

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:11.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
to open up again,

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.970 align:middle line:84%
are you going to
zip off to China?

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:16.287 align:middle line:10%
Are you going to
zip off on vacation,

00:46:16.287 --> 00:46:18.370 align:middle line:10%
or are you going to start
staying in your own area

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:20.920 align:middle line:10%
and patronizing as we
do our local coffee

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.660 align:middle line:10%
shop and local farmers?

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:24.220 align:middle line:10%
The farmers market
was the busiest

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:26.310 align:middle line:10%
I've ever seen it in
the last couple weeks.

00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:27.190 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: In the first
weekend it opened.

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.610 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:29.463 align:middle line:10%
I mean, everything
started opening back up.

00:46:29.463 --> 00:46:31.630 align:middle line:10%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: All the
best practices were there.

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:32.680 align:middle line:10%
The masks were there.

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:33.910 align:middle line:10%
The social distancing.

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:36.880 align:middle line:10%
The people having distance
between to the extent

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.550 align:middle line:10%
that they could.

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:41.838 align:middle line:10%
But there was this
extra zeal to--

00:46:41.838 --> 00:46:43.630 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Happy to be
out together, alive,

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:44.430 align:middle line:10%
have fresh food.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And to
support local business.

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.730 align:middle line:90%
And it makes you safer, right?

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not bringing
in all these weird viruses.

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Or if you do, it's
just in a small way

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.450 align:middle line:90%
that can easily be assimilated.

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:57.970 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's helping
people understand

00:46:57.970 --> 00:46:59.530 align:middle line:90%
that it's safer physically.

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:02.450 align:middle line:84%
But economically, it's
opening up a whole new avenue

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:03.250 align:middle line:90%
of connection.

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That gives us
control over our true economy.

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:11.620 align:middle line:84%
You're saying take on some
of these big boogeymen,

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:13.360 align:middle line:84%
so to speak-- the
boogeyman of the past.

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:14.747 align:middle line:90%
Take on big pharma.

00:47:14.747 --> 00:47:16.330 align:middle line:84%
We're all being faced
with this notion

00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:18.400 align:middle line:84%
or to vaccinate or
not to vaccinate.

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's scared,
divided, and we're not

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:22.480 align:middle line:90%
going to get into that debate.

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.940 align:middle line:84%
But the point is we have
a choice in the matter.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: We do.

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we decide whether
we're going to engage with

00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:31.810 align:middle line:84%
the pharmaceutical industry any
longer to the degree we have,

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:33.520 align:middle line:90%
because it's been ridiculous.

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.620 align:middle line:84%
The amount of drugs,
the number of drugs

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:38.020 align:middle line:84%
that people are on
even by the time they

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:39.910 align:middle line:90%
reach middle age sometime.

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:43.750 align:middle line:84%
You with statins
and all, you know,

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:47.400 align:middle line:84%
management of type 2 diabetes
and so forth, insulin.

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:52.390 align:middle line:84%
That as you said earlier, we
can manage that with education.

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:53.598 align:middle line:90%
Changing self practices.

00:47:53.598 --> 00:47:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: We can.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And not allowing ourselves to be
divided along traditional lines

00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:00.490 align:middle line:84%
to turn ourselves
against each other.

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:04.330 align:middle line:84%
In terms of big pharma, the
best thing that we can do

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:07.450 align:middle line:84%
is begin to develop our
diet and our exercise.

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Diabetes too, I
mentioned before,

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:11.680 align:middle line:84%
can almost be
completely eliminated

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:12.970 align:middle line:90%
without any need for drugs.

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:15.490 align:middle line:84%
That's already established
in mainstream society.

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:18.040 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is create
the culture around it

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and the community support
and reinforcement around it.

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Is that going to collapse
a lot of the drug profits?

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:24.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes it is.

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to help collapse
big pharmas hold or monopoly?

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Yes it is, but that's
ultimately the only way we're

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.720 align:middle line:90%
going to move things forward.

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.990 align:middle line:84%
It happened and
it worked in the--

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and a template was created
in the organic food movement.

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:41.290 align:middle line:84%
We can do it with
every single thing.

00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:44.590 align:middle line:84%
With the big rent and the
big housing boondoggle,

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:46.480 align:middle line:90%
we can move in together.

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:50.260 align:middle line:84%
We can build our own
houses and communities

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.400 align:middle line:90%
and withdraw from that.

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And we can do this
in every single area.

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:57.990 align:middle line:90%
We did it with organic foods.

00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:59.580 align:middle line:90%
We voted with our feet.

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:01.060 align:middle line:90%
We said we're moving over here.

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:04.360 align:middle line:84%
They tried to bring us back with
addictive high fructose corn

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.090 align:middle line:84%
syrup and all kinds of pesticide
laden food to make it cheaper.

00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:09.340 align:middle line:84%
We said it's not
worth our health.

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:10.540 align:middle line:90%
And they had to follow.

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:13.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even tried to
buy up family organics

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and so forth because they
knew that they could not

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.120 align:middle line:90%
win that game.

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.420 align:middle line:90%
Well we can do it in every area.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:22.250 align:middle line:84%
We can do it in the energy
area and move towards solar,

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:23.887 align:middle line:90%
and move to a local production.

00:49:23.887 --> 00:49:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We can do
it with transportation.

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:26.545 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: We can
do it with transportation.

00:49:26.545 --> 00:49:29.612 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Moving toward
hybrid or even electric cars.

00:49:29.612 --> 00:49:31.570 align:middle line:84%
The prices are coming
down on all these things.

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Public transport,
using bicycles.

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And each one
of these moves is more local.

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:38.390 align:middle line:90%
Is more decentralized.

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:40.660 align:middle line:84%
It's more under our
control, and less

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.830 align:middle line:84%
putting us dependent
upon somebody else.

00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How do we get
to the big one, though?

00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:47.098 align:middle line:84%
The one that Bernie
Sanders movement

00:49:47.098 --> 00:49:48.140 align:middle line:90%
was trying to get behind.

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is, how do
we make accountable

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:55.620 align:middle line:84%
those who are not paying
their fair share, so to speak?

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And this really is creating a
lot of resentment among people.

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And part of it too is that
it's this kind of twisted world

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:06.430 align:middle line:84%
where we give these people
our adulation and respect.

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:10.815 align:middle line:84%
Why are we admiring and
adoring people like this?

00:50:10.815 --> 00:50:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And we
can make that distinction.

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:15.280 align:middle line:84%
We can say, you have a
good product here helping

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.380 align:middle line:84%
to create connections
and communities.

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Or this app that's
allowing these communities

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:21.580 align:middle line:90%
to do time sharing.

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And then still say, but the
vast majority of your money

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:29.860 align:middle line:84%
is being funneled into--
against us and against life.

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:30.940 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So again, we have to do the
education around that and say,

00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:37.330 align:middle line:84%
we will buy these products
for these reasons.

00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And we will
absolutely, absolutely

00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:42.100 align:middle line:84%
band together across
divisions to elect

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:45.910 align:middle line:84%
people we know are going
to tax these corporations.

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:47.192 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This is critical.

00:50:47.192 --> 00:50:49.150 align:middle line:84%
This is real-- in my
opinion, this is critical.

00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: And don't
allow ourselves to be divided

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:51.940 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:55.100 align:middle line:90%
We share a common goal.

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're libertarian,
progressive, liberal

00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:00.430 align:middle line:84%
conservative-- of
sovereignty and community.

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Universally loved and
accepted by all those people.

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:07.930 align:middle line:84%
We now have to develop the
practice of acting on it,

00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and then also
critically examining

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and acting against those
things which interrupt or go

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:15.970 align:middle line:90%
against us.

00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:18.148 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to do
it mean spiritedly.

00:51:18.148 --> 00:51:19.690 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to--
we don't even have

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:23.810 align:middle line:84%
to use the word conspiracy to
recognize it's a business plan.

00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:27.723 align:middle line:84%
They're going to use us for our
profits, not for our own good.

00:51:27.723 --> 00:51:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You have said
this before on other shows.

00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:32.680 align:middle line:84%
These are not conspiracies
you are talking about.

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.450 align:middle line:90%
This is a business plan.

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:35.980 align:middle line:84%
The guys that have
the money and are

00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:38.860 align:middle line:84%
holding those kinds
of chips, we're just

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:40.182 align:middle line:90%
part of their business plan.

00:51:40.182 --> 00:51:41.140 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to make--

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:44.290 align:middle line:84%
we can just unplug and not
support that business plan.

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I would like
us to show a graphic

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:47.950 align:middle line:90%
that I'm really happy about.

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I came up with it
thinking this is wrong.

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.760 align:middle line:84%
When I kept hearing
all the conspiracy

00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.770 align:middle line:84%
theories, and a lot of
market conspiracies--

00:51:56.770 --> 00:51:58.270 align:middle line:90%
they're just simple facts.

00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:02.830 align:middle line:84%
They're truths that the systems
that are in place right now

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:04.900 align:middle line:84%
are being used against
us, as you say.

00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:06.855 align:middle line:84%
But we've known
about the pyramids

00:52:06.855 --> 00:52:09.250 align:middle line:84%
where you have
the 1% at the top.

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're called
the useless eaters

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:13.060 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of derogatory terms.

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:16.780 align:middle line:84%
About the poor human beings down
at the bottom-- the bulk of us.

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at
the new inverted pyramid,

00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:22.300 align:middle line:84%
because I think it
really represents what

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:23.500 align:middle line:90%
you and I are talking about.

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Absolutely.

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:25.570 align:middle line:90%
I love this by the way.

00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Regina, when you mentioned it,
I just saw so many uses for it.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And I saw it as
a perfect summary

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:33.910 align:middle line:90%
of where we need to move.

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:37.600 align:middle line:10%
I know that I could show
this graph to a libertarian,

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.240 align:middle line:10%
to someone who shares many
different political views

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.640 align:middle line:10%
or cultural views and they
would all agree with it.

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.920 align:middle line:10%
And would all give him
a fun wonderful feeling.

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.637 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it doesn't matter
what side you're on,

00:52:48.637 --> 00:52:50.180 align:middle line:90%
we all want the same thing.

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: We do.

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:52.595 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Politically it
doesn't matter what side.

00:52:52.595 --> 00:52:54.250 align:middle line:84%
We're just looking
at different lenses

00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:56.770 align:middle line:84%
to help us get to
this place, where

00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:59.030 align:middle line:84%
you can see in the pyramid
here, we're healthy.

00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.830 align:middle line:90%
We're happy.

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:00.630 align:middle line:90%
We have family.

00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:01.870 align:middle line:90%
We have friendships.

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:06.040 align:middle line:84%
We have community and
activity, and good health

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and good healthy
food and so forth.

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:09.640 align:middle line:90%
This is our birthright.

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes it is.

00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And it is the groundwork
for spirituality.

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:17.050 align:middle line:84%
If we have that high
frequency, healthy living,

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:19.630 align:middle line:84%
our spiritual development
will take off.

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:22.720 align:middle line:10%
We've been in stunted spiritual
and metaphysical development

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:25.070 align:middle line:10%
now because of the
way in which we've

00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:27.070 align:middle line:10%
given away our sovereignty
and allowed our Earth

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:30.400 align:middle line:10%
to be polluted and allowed the
ways in which our societies are

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.650 align:middle line:10%
structured not to
honor our spirits.

00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Now it's time that we
began to move forward.

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:39.910 align:middle line:84%
To emerge with this
commitment, and this courage,

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:42.268 align:middle line:84%
and this creativity, and this
compassion for each other.

00:53:42.268 --> 00:53:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And this care.

00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We have to start
caring about ourselves and one

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:48.370 align:middle line:90%
another again.

00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:48.610 align:middle line:90%
That's

00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Critical.

00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because a lot of
us stopped even caring about

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:51.150 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:54.700 align:middle line:84%
We just ran ourselves ragged
to be part of the larger game

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:57.550 align:middle line:84%
that we're not even the
ones that created the game.

00:53:57.550 --> 00:53:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We've plugged into--

00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: We're
going to create our own game,

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.953 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
bring that care,

00:54:01.953 --> 00:54:03.370 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to make it strong.

00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:06.460 align:middle line:84%
I see it as a beautiful
golden opportunity

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:08.880 align:middle line:84%
that's going to cause some
suffering in the short term.

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.690 align:middle line:90%
Long term, we have to do it.

00:54:10.690 --> 00:54:12.100 align:middle line:90%
We have to come back together.

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:13.350 align:middle line:90%
And I thank you for your work.

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:14.590 align:middle line:90%
You've done so much research.

00:54:14.590 --> 00:54:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, every day you're
just passing on new insights

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:20.170 align:middle line:84%
to me, which I absolutely
love because it

00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:21.320 align:middle line:90%
helps me do what I do.

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:23.620 align:middle line:84%
But both of us have,
along with many people

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:25.760 align:middle line:84%
watching this, this
one thing in common.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.090 align:middle line:84%
We're all looking for this
brighter, more connected,

00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:30.070 align:middle line:84%
healthier, more
sustainable future.

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:33.460 align:middle line:84%
This is our golden opportunity
if we can get out of it.

00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:36.990 align:middle line:10%
Take this time to not just
go back to what we knew

00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:40.330 align:middle line:10%
and fall into fear, but really
consciously engage with it.

00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:41.633 align:middle line:90%
I think our time is at hand.

00:54:41.633 --> 00:54:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>> YIAMOUYIANNIS: I think
our time is at hand.

00:54:43.550 --> 00:54:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:45.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you Zeus.

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Zeus has done a number of videos
and articles on this topic
