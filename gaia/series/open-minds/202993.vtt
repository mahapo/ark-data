00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:22.680 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Never before
has it been more important

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.280 align:middle line:10%
to begin looking into the nature
of reality in an ordered way.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:10%
This is what the various
ancient mystical orders

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.080 align:middle line:10%
were based upon, a
clear intellect endowed

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:10%
with the capacity to see deeper
truths, even unseen energies.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.470 align:middle line:84%
We have Robert
Gilbert with us today

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.740 align:middle line:84%
to speak about the unique
virtues of the ancient lineages

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.910 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge, and you span
all of them pretty much.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:90%
And some more modern ones.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.310 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Robert.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>> ROBERT GILBERT:
Great to be here.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is the first
time you've been on Gaia.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: It's
the first time, yes.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you have
a really fascinating story.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:10%
Your site,
vesica.org, you really

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.440 align:middle line:10%
split it into science
and spirituality.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is really big,
because this is who you are,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.010 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of people
don't understand

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.800 align:middle line:84%
that Rosicrucianism,
Hermeticism is really

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:90%
called occult science.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Yes.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: People think you're
going into the mysteries that

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.740 align:middle line:84%
are more nebulous and unseen
without understanding,

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.342 align:middle line:84%
these are highly structured
systems of information.

00:01:23.342 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Absolutely.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.842 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Very
scientifically based.

00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
So just for a moment, just
finish that sentence off for me

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.520 align:middle line:84%
because I want to get into this
really intriguing part of who

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.870 align:middle line:90%
you were before.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: OK,
great, thank you.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.360 align:middle line:10%
One thing that I often say
about the current situation

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.870 align:middle line:10%
in metaphysics is that we
live in an incredible time--

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.630 align:middle line:10%
that is, both a
blessing and a curse.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And the blessing
of it is that we

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:84%
have access to
esoteric information

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.930 align:middle line:84%
from an incredible
range of traditions

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.670 align:middle line:84%
all over the planet,
things that used

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:90%
to be very hidden, very secret.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.500 align:middle line:84%
That in earlier
times on the Earth,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to spend your whole
lifetime trying to access

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.920 align:middle line:90%
small bits of that knowledge.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: It's available
now in an incredible flood.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And so to have so much available
to us is really such a gift.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's a curse
because a lot of it

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.750 align:middle line:84%
has come out in a
very fragmented form.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.640 align:middle line:10%
And so in modern
metaphysics, we have

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.000 align:middle line:10%
to try to put together these
fragments into a hole that

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.500 align:middle line:10%
makes sense to us.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And so what the Vesica Institute
that I founded is really about

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.680 align:middle line:84%
is, how do we put
together these pieces

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.890 align:middle line:84%
from different traditions, from
different bodies of knowledge

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.950 align:middle line:84%
into a coherent whole so
that we can understand

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.600 align:middle line:84%
how to develop our consciousness
and our energy in the most

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.830 align:middle line:90%
clear, concise way possible?

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So really trying to clarify the
core principles behind the work

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:90%
so people can get to really--

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.960 align:middle line:90%
the meat--

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Useful.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: Yes, the most useful
things as quickly as possible.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.768 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the
thing is, you can go--

00:02:53.768 --> 00:02:56.520 align:middle line:84%
you can study for many,
many years any one of these

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.540 align:middle line:90%
traditions.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.095 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes if you don't have
a certain level of discernment,

00:03:04.095 --> 00:03:06.717 align:middle line:84%
it's not ever going
to be applicable.

00:03:06.717 --> 00:03:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: I'm so glad
you brought that up.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.550 align:middle line:84%
For the work that
we do with creating

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:84%
a clear, concise overview of
the sciences of subtle energy

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and of consciousness,
discernment is really

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.150 align:middle line:90%
the foundation of everything.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.133 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And it's something
that probably is not emphasized

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:26.230 align:middle line:90%
enough in modern metaphysics.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And so for the development
of discernment,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's important
to see where we are today

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.940 align:middle line:90%
in modern initiatory processes.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:84%
If we look at ancient
times, people normally

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:84%
went through initiation by
joining a particular initiation

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.775 align:middle line:84%
group, often a closed
group, and you'd

00:03:45.775 --> 00:03:48.025 align:middle line:84%
be a part of that one group
for the rest of your life.

00:03:48.025 --> 00:03:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And so you would
go very deep in that one

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.100 align:middle line:84%
tradition, but you wouldn't
learn things from other

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.660 align:middle line:90%
perspectives necessarily.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And you would have a particular
teacher or a guru who really

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.090 align:middle line:90%
guided the entire process.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:84%
There's been a huge
change in the last couple

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.930 align:middle line:90%
of hundred years.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Part of it was the
Scientific Revolution

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.780 align:middle line:84%
where the old religions
began to die to some extent

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.700 align:middle line:84%
and people became
more independent

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.500 align:middle line:90%
in their spiritual search.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.630 align:middle line:84%
But today there's
developed a kind

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.110 align:middle line:84%
of independent
initiatory process

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.000 align:middle line:84%
that people are
voting with their feet

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.540 align:middle line:90%
to do all over the world.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So now millions upon
millions of people

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.540 align:middle line:84%
do not say that they have one
particular tradition or one

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.850 align:middle line:84%
particular teacher,
but rather, they're

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.580 align:middle line:84%
gathering information
from everywhere,

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.608 align:middle line:84%
and that's really what
I think Gaia is about.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.150 align:middle line:84%
To gather information
from everywhere

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and put it into a
useful system that

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.910 align:middle line:90%
works for whatever they need.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's in a really, I
think, well-considered process.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Whereas a lot of times what
people tend to do also is

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:84%
go through and
cherry-pick a little

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.183 align:middle line:90%
of this, a little of that.

00:04:54.183 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Cobble something together that
already reflects who they are.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Right.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's where
it starts breaking down,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:84%
and millions of
people do that, too.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Right, absolutely.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.280 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the work from the
European Rosicrucians, people

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.760 align:middle line:84%
like Rudolf Steiner, they
really emphasize this concept

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.730 align:middle line:84%
that in modern times,
self-initiation

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:84%
is a major part of
spiritual development.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.093 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: Because we are
able to choose and learn from

00:05:20.093 --> 00:05:23.270 align:middle line:84%
so many different
traditions and teachers.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.300 align:middle line:84%
But this requires that we
have a very keen intelligence

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.100 align:middle line:84%
to work through a
lot of information.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.930 align:middle line:84%
We have to be very proactive
and put it together

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.190 align:middle line:84%
so the different pieces actually
form a coherent whole that

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.770 align:middle line:84%
creates something in our
own personal development

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.600 align:middle line:84%
that actually leads us to
where we need to get to.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And as part of
that understanding

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.840 align:middle line:84%
of the context we're
working in, discernment

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.610 align:middle line:84%
is the absolute
foundation of everything.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Absolutely, and
that's what we appear to be

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.680 align:middle line:84%
lacking right now across
the board as a species.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
things about Steiner's work

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.790 align:middle line:90%
that was so beautiful.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Is it was cohesive,
even more so than I

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:84%
think a lot of the
ancient traditions,

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.100 align:middle line:84%
which brought in a
lot of information.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.430 align:middle line:84%
I call a Hermetic education
a proper education because it

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.200 align:middle line:90%
spans everything, from--

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.300 align:middle line:84%
in all of the sciences
to art to poetry

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.080 align:middle line:84%
to color and light
and the cosmos.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.760 align:middle line:90%
That's a proper education.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.130 align:middle line:84%
But it is like a
liberal arts education

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:84%
that's deeply
spiritual, whereas what

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.600 align:middle line:84%
he was doing with anthroposophy
was very, very focused

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.060 align:middle line:84%
around a type of
human development

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.162 align:middle line:84%
that you could kind of
get your mind around.

00:06:34.162 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Absolutely.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And so to have
true freedom in our spiritual

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.590 align:middle line:84%
development, I think that's only
possible if we have sufficient

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:43.760 align:middle line:90%
contextual knowledge.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: If you don't
have contextual knowledge,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.008 align:middle line:84%
you don't have enough
information to make an informed

00:06:48.008 --> 00:06:50.270 align:middle line:84%
choice, and then
there's no freedom.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And so to have the
discernment, then,

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.750 align:middle line:84%
to be able to choose what
is the best pathway or what,

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:84%
in my limited amount
of time and energy

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:84%
that any person has, where do
I want to focus my attention

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
to develop my core structure
to the level that's going to be

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.980 align:middle line:90%
the most important for me?

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And from my perspective, to
go beyond the present lifetime

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.000 align:middle line:84%
something that becomes the
core of our development

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.350 align:middle line:90%
that we can keep?

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe
that after we die,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.470 align:middle line:84%
we lose all the superficial
aspects, but what we keep

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.235 align:middle line:84%
is the core structure
of the subtle bodies

00:07:23.235 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle line:90%
in the consciousness.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: And that moves on.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So if we use our
lifetimes properly,

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.320 align:middle line:84%
we can really structure
the subtle bodies

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.600 align:middle line:84%
so that we can take that
through the gate of death

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.273 align:middle line:84%
and keep moving through a
true initiatory process.

00:07:35.273 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You are so right.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad you're so
articulate in the way you

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:90%
state all of this.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm really very
appreciative of your saying

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.630 align:middle line:84%
even just that because we
always talk about and bandy

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.490 align:middle line:84%
about the notion
of reincarnation,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.130 align:middle line:84%
but we don't talk often
enough about the fact

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.400 align:middle line:84%
that this is an ongoing process
of refinement from lifetime

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.630 align:middle line:90%
to lifetime to lifetime.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's smart for
one to consider

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.520 align:middle line:84%
what you want to
inherit yourself

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:84%
when you come into
your next incarnation.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's directly going
to be a reflection of what

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.125 align:middle line:90%
you develop now.

00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: Yes, I really
feel like we need to refocus

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.110 align:middle line:84%
on the importance of
our present earthly life

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:84%
and the opportunity
that it gives us.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.910 align:middle line:84%
I think many classical
traditions will

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.460 align:middle line:84%
agree that everyone goes through
initiation in earthly life,

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.460 align:middle line:84%
and you can either do it,
as the Buddhists would

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.497 align:middle line:84%
say, through skillful
means, or you

00:08:24.497 --> 00:08:26.330 align:middle line:84%
can do it through the
School of Hard Knocks.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You can
stumble through it.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.662 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: That's right.

00:08:28.662 --> 00:08:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And you're better off choosing
the School of Skillful Means

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.368 align:middle line:84%
so you don't have to do all
the unnecessary suffering

00:08:33.368 --> 00:08:35.000 align:middle line:90%
of the School of Hard Knocks.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.130 align:middle line:84%
But if we can then
really understand

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.190 align:middle line:84%
what the core principles
and processes are

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.380 align:middle line:84%
to develop our
energy body, which

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:84%
is what then feeds
our consciousness

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.300 align:middle line:84%
so the consciousness can expand
and really bring together--

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.390 align:middle line:84%
like they did in ancient India,
the concepts of the Shiva,

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate consciousness,
and the Shakti,

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.830 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate energy,
and bring together

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.380 align:middle line:84%
energetic and consciousness
practices that

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.810 align:middle line:84%
are going to create a
structure in our subtle bodies

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.150 align:middle line:84%
that we can keep and
that we can take with us

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.440 align:middle line:90%
through the gate of death.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.540 align:middle line:84%
I think many classical
traditions were focused

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.090 align:middle line:84%
on that, and that in
modern metaphysics,

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.340 align:middle line:84%
we can bring together
incredible insights

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.050 align:middle line:84%
from so many
traditions with this,

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.060 align:middle line:84%
but unfortunately it's
been so fragmented today

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.280 align:middle line:84%
that people don't always see
how the pieces fit together.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.155 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's true.

00:09:17.155 --> 00:09:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And also popularized
to the point

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.293 align:middle line:84%
of almost being of chewing
gum status in some cases.

00:09:23.293 --> 00:09:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: It can
be caricatured.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.293 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, it
can be caricatured.

00:09:26.293 --> 00:09:27.890 align:middle line:10%
So you're really--
what you're looking

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.530 align:middle line:10%
to do is bring the fulsome
of it together in a way

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.570 align:middle line:10%
that we can understand
and in a way that

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.210 align:middle line:10%
can be almost validated
essentially through the world

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.320 align:middle line:10%
and body of science.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.278 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Absolutely.

00:09:37.278 --> 00:09:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So, you're
a scientist by nature.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back into this
other part of your life.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.020 align:middle line:90%
OK, I gotta read this off here.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.750 align:middle line:84%
You were a US Marine
Corps instructor

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:51.928 align:middle line:84%
of nuclear, biological,
chemical warfare survival.

00:09:51.928 --> 00:09:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: That's right.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.345 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK,
that's a mouthful.

00:09:54.345 --> 00:09:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about who
you were in this job you

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.850 align:middle line:84%
were doing and then
ultimately will

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.337 align:middle line:84%
go into how it took you
to where you are now.

00:10:01.337 --> 00:10:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: Well, this
present conversation,

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to say something I
don't often say about that

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:84%
background, which is
that I believe as part

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.592 align:middle line:84%
of our incarnating, that
we have all kinds of skills

00:10:11.592 --> 00:10:13.550 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge that we
have from previous times.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.398 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And one of the
principles of this is that

00:10:16.398 --> 00:10:18.740 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we need to
have certain experiences

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.030 align:middle line:84%
in the present lifetime to
remind us of the things that we

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.953 align:middle line:84%
developed before and to bring
those skills back up on--

00:10:24.953 --> 00:10:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.453 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: --in the
current lifetime.

00:10:27.453 --> 00:10:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, to bring up
certain skills, knowledge,

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.180 align:middle line:84%
willpower, whatever it might
be from some previous lifetimes

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:39.790 align:middle line:84%
that were more in the
military and monastic than I

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:44.000 align:middle line:84%
needed when I was a young
man to join the military.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to
join a outfit that

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.670 align:middle line:84%
was more of an elite
type of structure,

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and so I joined the US
Marine Corps at a young age.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And my test scores
were fairly high,

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.140 align:middle line:84%
so they assigned me
unexpectedly to become

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.500 align:middle line:84%
an instructor in nuclear,
biological, chemical warfare

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.545 align:middle line:90%
defense and survival.

00:11:04.545 --> 00:11:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did you have
any schooling or background

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:90%
in this?

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Or did they send you
to university for this?

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:84%
How did this work
if you didn't have

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.660 align:middle line:90%
a background in these areas?

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: Well, they literally
just go off the test scores,

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.020 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And at that
particular time-- this

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:90%
was still during the Cold War.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.720 align:middle line:90%
This is 1982 when I entered.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And so they needed to expand
the number of people involved

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:84%
in this, because
unfortunately, as mankind tends

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.850 align:middle line:84%
to do in modern times,
we have infinite funding

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.832 align:middle line:84%
for technologies of death
and limited funding--

00:11:32.832 --> 00:11:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And none for life.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Exactly.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a fairly
sobering field

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.070 align:middle line:84%
to be involved in nuclear,
biological, chemical warfare.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:46.640 align:middle line:84%
This is basically finding, how
do we pervert physics, biology,

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and chemistry to be able to
kill as many people as possible?

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.670 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's a
very sobering field

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.100 align:middle line:90%
to be a part of as a young man.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:84%
But it also was something that
awakened in me the importance

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.000 align:middle line:84%
of understanding how do we
develop in a positive sense

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.980 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
counterbalance this?

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.680 align:middle line:84%
But also held within
it was the idea

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.050 align:middle line:84%
that if we're going
to be teaching people

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.530 align:middle line:84%
how to survive these types
of unconventional warfare,

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.060 align:middle line:84%
it all comes back to physics,
biology, and chemistry.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: So in
the Marine Corps,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.160 align:middle line:84%
you don't get sent
to university,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.690 align:middle line:84%
you get sent to particular
training schools.

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was
at Fort McClellan,

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.180 align:middle line:84%
which was an Army training
base in Anniston, Alabama.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And so they have their
own training systems.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.110 align:middle line:84%
But once I got out
of that training

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.170 align:middle line:84%
to become a teacher
in this, I spent

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.740 align:middle line:84%
a lot of my own time going
more deeply into the background

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.763 align:middle line:84%
of physics, biology,
chemistry, and one thing

00:12:40.763 --> 00:12:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that I found while I
was in the military

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.220 align:middle line:84%
and studying these
topics is that there

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:84%
were a whole series
of studies that

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:52.610 align:middle line:84%
were based on geometric
aspects of physics, biology,

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and chemistry that the general
public is not aware of.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.590 align:middle line:84%
We get presented with an image
of these modern sciences that's

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.170 align:middle line:84%
almost completely
mathematical or algebraic.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And for the vast
majority of people,

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.260 align:middle line:90%
that's very off-putting.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.183 align:middle line:84%
They're traumatized
by high school math

00:13:07.183 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:84%
and they don't really want
anything to do with that.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And for example, I
found one document

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.690 align:middle line:84%
that was sponsored
by NATO and it

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:17.470 align:middle line:84%
was a study of chemical
structures from a purely

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.180 align:middle line:90%
geometric perspective.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this makes
everything so clear.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.160 align:middle line:84%
It's so easy to understand--
a child could understand

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle line:84%
how these natural systems work
based on the geometry of it.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And over time,
what this led me to

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:34.570 align:middle line:84%
was to study what the
geometric basis was

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:38.020 align:middle line:84%
of modern physics,
biology, and chemistry,

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and then to go back
into ancient traditions

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.300 align:middle line:84%
and study what we think of
today as sacred geometry

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and find one-to-one
matches between what's

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.510 align:middle line:84%
been rediscovered today
in modern technology

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:84%
as the patterns that all
of science is based on

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and see how that was
known thousands of years

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.770 align:middle line:90%
previously in other traditions.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And if I could give one
particular example that

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.730 align:middle line:84%
was very affecting for me, I
was doing research, of course,

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.960 align:middle line:84%
into the Egyptian and
the Pythagorean schools

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and about the concepts of the
Platonic geometry, Archimedean

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.010 align:middle line:90%
geometry.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And so this all goes back to the
perfect divisions of a sphere.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.790 align:middle line:84%
The sphere is the perfect
form in sacred geometry.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
the center, which

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:84%
is our gateway to the
divine, has a boundary being

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.450 align:middle line:84%
created around it which becomes
the sphere of all of creation.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And for a sphere, the distance
between the divine center

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:37.300 align:middle line:84%
and the periphery of creation is
equidistant in every direction.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.910 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes the
sphere the perfect form

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.200 align:middle line:90%
in sacred geometry.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Every part of it is
equidistant from the divine,

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.260 align:middle line:90%
from the center.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And so the next issue that
comes up in sacred geometry

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.150 align:middle line:84%
is, how do you divide that
sphere into different forms

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:84%
that have different
vibrational powers,

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:58.023 align:middle line:84%
or what they would call sitas
in the Indian tradition.

00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let me just stay
with you for a moment here.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: OK.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.193 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So are you saying
that all of the other forms

00:15:03.193 --> 00:15:06.233 align:middle line:84%
of geometry are essentially
embedded within the sphere?

00:15:06.233 --> 00:15:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: When you study the
particular pathway that was

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.500 align:middle line:84%
taken in Greece, for
example, coming out of Egypt,

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.590 align:middle line:84%
then they really start with the
sphere and how do you divide

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:17.290 align:middle line:84%
the sphere, but we don't always
explain what I just mentioned

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.815 align:middle line:84%
about why do they always say
the sphere is the first form

00:15:19.815 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:90%
of sacred geometry.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which makes
perfect sense, of course.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Just look at the cosmos,
look at anything.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Exactly.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the pathway they followed
again, coming out of Egypt,

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:84%
was how do we then divide
the sphere into equal parts

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.610 align:middle line:84%
that all have exactly
the same shape face, all

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:37.642 align:middle line:90%
the same angles, et cetera?

00:15:37.642 --> 00:15:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there are
five perfect divisions

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.312 align:middle line:84%
of the sphere that we
call the Platonic solids.

00:15:42.312 --> 00:15:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing about
it that I found

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:84%
fascinating was in
the old Greek times,

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.470 align:middle line:84%
they only made four
of those forms public.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And the fifth form, the
form of the ether, which

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.980 align:middle line:84%
is the dodecahedron, a 12-sided
form and every one of the faces

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:84%
is a pentagon, that
form was kept secret.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we cannot
release this to the public.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:84%
The dodecahedron
has to stay secret

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.240 align:middle line:84%
because if it was to
be misused as the key

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.460 align:middle line:84%
to the ether, the
dynamic life force,

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.280 align:middle line:84%
it could unleash incredible
forces of destruction

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.450 align:middle line:90%
that people can't even imagine.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And so in the Pythagorean
school, and later

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Platonic schools,
you had to swear

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.243 align:middle line:84%
you'd never make public
the form of the ether.

00:16:20.243 --> 00:16:21.660 align:middle line:84%
The only place
that you really see

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.270 align:middle line:84%
it described by
Plato in his writings

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.750 align:middle line:84%
is when he says that the
Earth, when seen from above,

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.178 align:middle line:84%
looks like a 12-sided
leather ball.

00:16:30.178 --> 00:16:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking about
the dodecahedral structure

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.450 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth itself.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Other than that,
it's very secret.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And so then I began to look
at declassified photographs

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:39.960 align:middle line:90%
and documents.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Do you actually go to the work
of people who are involved

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.290 align:middle line:90%
with the Manhattan Project?

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: So for example,
Professor Robert Moon from

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.570 align:middle line:90%
the University of Chicago.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:53.250 align:middle line:84%
He later made public a model of
the whole periodic table that's

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.960 align:middle line:90%
based on pure Platonic geometry.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And so one particular
element is based on the cube,

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.560 align:middle line:84%
another one is based on
the cube developing further

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.880 align:middle line:90%
to the octahedron, et cetera.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.285 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And so there are
these models of the periodic

00:17:06.285 --> 00:17:09.250 align:middle line:84%
table that's based on this
type of classical geometry.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:12.119 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to look for
declassified photographs

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:13.670 align:middle line:90%
of the first nuclear weapons.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:84%
So I knew he was a part
of the Manhattan Project.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, also if you take
a look at Werner Heisenberg's

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.079 align:middle line:84%
work, he's very much
about Platonic geometry,

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.444 align:middle line:84%
and they're always dealing
with these ancient mysteries.

00:17:24.444 --> 00:17:26.819 align:middle line:84%
But these are only the most
advanced people in the field.

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:29.410 align:middle line:84%
The average person doesn't
know anything about it.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And so as I looked at
declassified photographs

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.530 align:middle line:84%
from the Manhattan Project,
I found these pictures

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:38.250 align:middle line:84%
of what the actual interior
of the first nuclear weapon

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.430 align:middle line:84%
exploded in Trinity Sands,
New Mexico actually look like.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Now what you normally
see, it looks

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.735 align:middle line:90%
like a sphere on the outside.

00:17:44.735 --> 00:17:46.110 align:middle line:84%
But if you take
off that cladding

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and see what's inside of it,
it's a perfect dodecahedron.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And they said they had to
make the first nuclear weapon

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.260 align:middle line:84%
in the form of a dodecahedron,
which they just described

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.100 align:middle line:84%
as 12 pentagonal faces in
the declassified documents,

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.230 align:middle line:84%
they said they had to do
that so that they acted

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:84%
as radiant mirrors that
would allow the critical mass

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.740 align:middle line:84%
to take place and for
the explosion to happen.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And when you see
that that's what

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:12.870 align:middle line:84%
we have in modern times, and
that thousands of years ago,

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.000 align:middle line:84%
from the Egyptian-Greek
tradition,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:84%
they had warned that the misuse
of the dodecahedral pattern wow

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:21.810 align:middle line:84%
could lead to incredible
forces of destruction.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.990 align:middle line:84%
You can see how much they
knew in ancient times.

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to do decades of
research and finding one-to-one

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
matches between modern
patterns from physics, biology,

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.150 align:middle line:84%
chemistry, and the same
patterns known and used

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.610 align:middle line:84%
in ancient traditions
around the world.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you go back, then,
to the understanding

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.410 align:middle line:84%
from the Greek and
Egyptian traditions,

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:50.460 align:middle line:84%
that would take you back, then,
into the Atlantean knowledge

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:56.310 align:middle line:84%
basis, which it has been
said, in some of those texts,

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:58.200 align:middle line:84%
did possess the
understanding and use

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.710 align:middle line:84%
of destructive
nuclear technologies,

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:90%
even in Atlantean times.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: I think it's
interesting to see that

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.830 align:middle line:84%
in modern metaphysics, a lot
of people somehow think that

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.710 align:middle line:84%
the idea of Atlantis
is a modern invention.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.170 align:middle line:84%
But of course, as you
know, it goes back

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:17.460 align:middle line:84%
to the writings from Plato
and others where in his books

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.710 align:middle line:84%
he's describing the
dialogues between Solon

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and these Greek initiates
and the Egyptian priest,

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and their Egyptian
priests are the ones

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:26.032 align:middle line:90%
talking about Atlantis.

00:19:26.032 --> 00:19:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Even the
Rosicrucianism and Hermetic

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:31.860 align:middle line:84%
traditions clearly state that
this is passed on knowledge

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.210 align:middle line:90%
from Atlantean times.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So obviously we had a time
in very ancient times--

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.824 align:middle line:84%
and it's speculation as
to whether it's 50,000,

00:19:39.824 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:90%
200,000 years--

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.370 align:middle line:84%
50,000, 200,000 years ago with
very advanced technologies

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.580 align:middle line:90%
that we are remembering.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Yes.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right?

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Absolutely.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.190 align:middle line:84%
One thing I think is
fascinating to look at

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:54.030 align:middle line:84%
is when you see particular
types of polarity relationships

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.380 align:middle line:84%
between ancient
and modern times.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.890 align:middle line:84%
So I believe from my research
that in ancient times,

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:02.040 align:middle line:84%
most of the concepts
that they formed

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.900 align:middle line:90%
were based on the etheric.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Chi, ki, prana, whatever they
called it in their tradition,

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.060 align:middle line:84%
the vital life force
itself was the basis

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.550 align:middle line:90%
of all science and all healing.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
understanding that's

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:17.190 align:middle line:84%
coming from the
outside-in, whereas today,

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.760 align:middle line:84%
now that we're in a reductionist
mechanistic mindset,

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.770 align:middle line:84%
it's the exact
opposite polarity.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:25.860 align:middle line:84%
We're starting with
the microscopic nature

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.750 align:middle line:84%
on the inside and
then going outward.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.133 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And so I think a lot
of the mindset that you would

00:20:31.133 --> 00:20:33.450 align:middle line:84%
have in the Atlantean time
going into the Egyptian,

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:37.020 align:middle line:84%
into the Greek is really coming
from an etheric perspective.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: I have no doubt
that a lot of what you hear

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.310 align:middle line:84%
in modern metaphysics
about the use of crystals,

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.790 align:middle line:84%
the use of amplified light, et
cetera in Atlantean times is

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.390 align:middle line:90%
absolutely the case.

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.690 align:middle line:84%
I was very fortunate to be
able to do some trainings

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:52.740 align:middle line:90%
with Marcel Vogel.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was just
going to bring him up.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.875 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: I loved--

00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:56.018 align:middle line:90%
I love Marcel.

00:20:56.018 --> 00:20:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He was, I
mean, really kind of--

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:84%
what later became the basis
of the computer industry

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.700 align:middle line:84%
through the use of
crystal technology.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:03.658 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Absolutely.

00:21:03.658 --> 00:21:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Liquid crystal
displays and the basis

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:84%
of the coding for hard drives,
it all came from Marcel.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.033 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And everyone that
was around him at the time

00:21:11.033 --> 00:21:13.465 align:middle line:84%
really believed that he was
a reincarnate Atlantean--

00:21:13.465 --> 00:21:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Atlantean.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.330 align:middle line:90%
Everyone believed that.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:16.570 align:middle line:90%
I remember that at the time.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Yes.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:18.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I never met him.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Friends did meet him and have
quite a few of his crystals,

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: He was
such a lovely person.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.655 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: I remember being
in a class with him where he

00:21:25.655 --> 00:21:28.380 align:middle line:84%
described how his life
transformed when he was walking

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.860 align:middle line:84%
on the beach one day, and I
believe he was a Catholic.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.538 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he
encountered Jesus on the beach.

00:21:35.538 --> 00:21:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And he was extremely serious
when he talked about this,

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.230 align:middle line:84%
and it was two different
phases of his life.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And he devoted his whole
life to this healing work

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.820 align:middle line:90%
after that happened.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And you might be familiar
with the particular project he

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.650 align:middle line:84%
did once, and there's
pictures of it

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.750 align:middle line:84%
available on the
internet where he

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.600 align:middle line:84%
had an amorphous
surface that was

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.520 align:middle line:90%
covered with liquid crystals.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.860 align:middle line:90%
Really a kind of fat crystal.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.570 align:middle line:90%
And there was no pattern on it.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And he meditated on
it for about an hour

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.400 align:middle line:84%
with the image of the
Blessed Mother from-- again,

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.480 align:middle line:90%
he was a Catholic.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And after an hour you see a
perfect image of the Blessed

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Mother appearing
on the crystals,

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:15.450 align:middle line:84%
because he wanted to show the
way that consciousness and mind

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.750 align:middle line:84%
power would be transformed
by the crystal into energy

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.350 align:middle line:90%
and into pattern into structure.

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:22.483 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they did the same with--

00:22:22.483 --> 00:22:24.855 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in a crude sense,
cymatics and all that,

00:22:24.855 --> 00:22:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and of course, you've
heard of Masaru Emoto's

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:29.190 align:middle line:84%
work and programming the
crystal structure of water,

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:33.240 align:middle line:84%
but crystals themselves have
so much more body to them

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.520 align:middle line:84%
if you have that
powerful a mind.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.860 align:middle line:84%
That's just-- I was
not aware of that.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.420 align:middle line:90%
I never saw those images.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.315 align:middle line:84%
That's incredible,
I'd love to see them.

00:22:41.315 --> 00:22:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: Yes,
they're amazing.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.190 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.910 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's continue on.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.300 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about the
Atlantean technologies.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:52.980 align:middle line:84%
You started seeing these
declassified documents

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and started looking at the
geometrical structure of energy

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.060 align:middle line:90%
of the Platonic solids, right?

00:22:59.060 --> 00:22:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Right.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so now how did
this start moving you forward

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.950 align:middle line:84%
into your later studies
after that in Rosicrucianism,

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.190 align:middle line:90%
And then onto Hermetics.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Let's discuss that.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: Well, another
one of my motives in joining

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.730 align:middle line:84%
the Marine Corps in particular,
as I love the ocean,

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:16.563 align:middle line:84%
I knew their bases were
always on the water.

00:23:16.563 --> 00:23:17.363 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:23:17.363 --> 00:23:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And also, I knew
that they were the ones with

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.020 align:middle line:90%
bases in Japan.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.885 align:middle line:84%
And for other karmic reasons, I
needed to spend time in Japan.

00:23:24.885 --> 00:23:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: From a past life?

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: I believe so.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.070 align:middle line:90%
At the time it was more of--

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:32.382 align:middle line:84%
people aren't completely
clear about karmic impulses.

00:23:32.382 --> 00:23:33.715 align:middle line:90%
It just comes as a will impulse.

00:23:33.715 --> 00:23:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: An impulse, yeah.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: I have to go here--

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Gotta go.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: I can't
tell you why, but--

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: So at
that time, I was like,

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.530 align:middle line:84%
I just know I have
to go there now.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I studied Shingon
Buddhism and other aspects

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.230 align:middle line:90%
of Eastern things in Japan.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And then when I came
back to the States,

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:50.670 align:middle line:84%
when I finished my
work there in 1985,

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I had a kind of spiritual
awakening experience

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.650 align:middle line:84%
where everything became
much more conscious.

00:23:55.650 --> 00:24:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I had
some inner experiences

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.700 align:middle line:90%
that when I then went to find--

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.830 align:middle line:84%
where can I find
external writings

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.542 align:middle line:84%
or other teachers that are
describing what I experienced?

00:24:07.542 --> 00:24:09.000 align:middle line:84%
The closest thing
I could find were

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.320 align:middle line:90%
the writings of Rudolf Steiner.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And so things that
Steiner was describing were

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:15.000 align:middle line:84%
exactly what I had
experienced internally.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.670 align:middle line:84%
So I got deeply into
Rosicrucianism and the work

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.610 align:middle line:84%
of Rudolf Steiner, who I'm still
a huge fan of his work today.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Just amazing work.

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And with that as a foundation,
continuing to put together

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.260 align:middle line:84%
the geometric basis of
all natural systems,

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.520 align:middle line:84%
I began to not only
study, but started

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.350 align:middle line:90%
to teach sacred geometry.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.940 align:middle line:84%
But I taught a
little bit different

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.120 align:middle line:84%
than many other people
teach sacred geometry today.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.740 align:middle line:84%
There are many great
teachers of it,

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.560 align:middle line:84%
but my approach was really
informed by my finding

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.410 align:middle line:84%
these one-to-one relationships
between the ancient patterns

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and the modern
technological patterns,

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and the other part of
it is that I really

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.150 align:middle line:84%
felt that the best way to teach
it is that sacred geometry is

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:55.300 align:middle line:90%
a divine language.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And every
geometric form is like a letter

00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:59.760 align:middle line:90%
of an alphabet.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you understand what
that geometric letter is

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:06.120 align:middle line:84%
n that divine alphabet, it
has a particular function,

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.920 align:middle line:90%
it has a particular power.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And just like we put
letters in an alphabet

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.770 align:middle line:84%
together to form a word, we
put geometric forms together

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.560 align:middle line:84%
to create a composite
form that brings together

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.890 align:middle line:84%
a series of powers,
including but only energy,

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.980 align:middle line:84%
but consciousness that is
the basis of everything

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:90%
in existence.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's in the mineral
realm or the plant realm,

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:29.010 align:middle line:84%
animal realm, human
realm, everything

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.890 align:middle line:84%
is based on particular
blueprint patterns

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:84%
of sacred geometric
forms that come together

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.230 align:middle line:84%
to create the essence
of what anything is.

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And I like to say
that for human beings,

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:45.480 align:middle line:84%
that just as all snowflakes
are crystallized water,

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.150 align:middle line:84%
all human beings are
crystallized spirit.

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And just like every snowflake
has a unique geometric form,

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.210 align:middle line:84%
every human being has a
unique geometric form.

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:56.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's within that
invisible structure

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.160 align:middle line:84%
of a person's energetic
field, which again, you

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.410 align:middle line:84%
can take with you through
the gate of death, that

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:05.460 align:middle line:84%
is the true individuality of
the person, what makes them

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.330 align:middle line:90%
a unique gift to the universe.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: There'll never be
another one like them again.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so once
this has been identified,

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:18.600 align:middle line:84%
once you've made this
corollary between the letters

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and the geometric
shapes and so forth,

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:84%
how is this functionally
utilized to shift

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.105 align:middle line:90%
one's frequencies?

00:26:26.105 --> 00:26:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Mmm, great question.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So I'll give you some
examples of building up

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:33.518 align:middle line:84%
the letters of the
divine alphabet.

00:26:33.518 --> 00:26:35.310 align:middle line:84%
If you start as the
classical traditions do

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.440 align:middle line:84%
in saying that the
circle or the sphere

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.900 align:middle line:84%
is the first primal
form, because you have

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.170 align:middle line:84%
the divine plane in
the center-- that's

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:47.040 align:middle line:84%
the original unified force
and the unity everything

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.130 align:middle line:84%
comes from, and then
you go out to a boundary

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:54.480 align:middle line:84%
to become the alchemical
container for whatever you're

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.810 align:middle line:84%
going to make and
manifest creation.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Then, again, in 2D
that becomes the point

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.800 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the circle.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.935 align:middle line:84%
That becomes the image
of gold in alchemy,

00:27:04.935 --> 00:27:07.380 align:middle line:84%
it becomes the image of
the sun in astrology,

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.810 align:middle line:84%
it becomes the image
of the Neta-Ra-Ah

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:11.280 align:middle line:90%
in the Egyptian tradition.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.660 align:middle line:90%
Everybody uses it.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's a circuit
diagram for how

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:19.680 align:middle line:84%
you create a balanced
relationship to the center,

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.760 align:middle line:90%
to the divine.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And then that becomes the
sphere in three dimensions.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.100 align:middle line:84%
So the circle and the
sphere are essentially

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.850 align:middle line:84%
nature's most archetypal
alchemical container

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:33.210 align:middle line:84%
for something to be birthed
in, something to be born in,

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.100 align:middle line:90%
something to be created from.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.710 align:middle line:84%
At that point, you then
begin to invaginate

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.260 align:middle line:84%
the top and the
bottom of the sphere,

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and with the twin
vortices coming

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:44.130 align:middle line:84%
in from the top and
bottom, they then

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.320 align:middle line:84%
connect at the zero point
in the center-- again,

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.920 align:middle line:84%
the divine, and that becomes
the center of that hyperbola

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.272 align:middle line:90%
movement that makes a torus.

00:27:51.272 --> 00:27:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Torus, yeah.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.438 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: So then the
torus becomes the next letter

00:27:54.438 --> 00:27:57.000 align:middle line:84%
of the divine alphabet, and
that's nature's most primal

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.900 align:middle line:84%
form to be able to circulate
energy in a completely balanced

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.762 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:28:01.762 --> 00:28:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.367 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And then it develops
further and you can study

00:28:04.367 --> 00:28:06.640 align:middle line:84%
things like the
spiral and the vortex,

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.610 align:middle line:84%
which is nature's method to
most powerfully move energy

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness from
one place to another,

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:16.350 align:middle line:84%
whether in the physical plane or
from one non-physical location

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.830 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And so applying it to ourselves,
this archetypal language

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.890 align:middle line:84%
of geometry not only works with
biology, chemistry, physics,

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:29.160 align:middle line:84%
all types of natural
sciences and the manifest

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.550 align:middle line:84%
world around us, it works
in our own consciousness

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.360 align:middle line:90%
and our own energy field.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And so you can start applying
the concept of the movement

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:39.060 align:middle line:90%
from the divine center outward.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And so for example, one
thing that I'd like to teach

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.910 align:middle line:84%
and our courses in
spiritual science

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:47.430 align:middle line:84%
is that you'll find the
traditions around the world

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:52.950 align:middle line:84%
tend to focus on one part
of a complementary polarity.

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And they don't always teach
both parts of that polarity,

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:56.860 align:middle line:90%
they teach one part of it.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to
be a Hermeticist.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.810 align:middle line:84%
You have to study
multiple systems

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, this is the
missing part of that system

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:05.350 align:middle line:90%
and put them together.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.770 align:middle line:10%
So as a practical
example of that,

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:09.810 align:middle line:10%
in some traditions
that I trained in,

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:12.510 align:middle line:10%
you're taught to
focus your attention

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:16.780 align:middle line:10%
on a particular nodal
point in the energy body.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.080 align:middle line:10%
So for some Sufi traditions
it might be a nodal point

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.280 align:middle line:10%
in the physical heart.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.140 align:middle line:84%
In some other
traditions, in Himalayas,

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.940 align:middle line:84%
you may be focusing
in the Cave of Brahma

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.510 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the head.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And so you're focusing
on that nodal point,

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:30.180 align:middle line:84%
and you move all of your
energy and attention

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.150 align:middle line:84%
into the center of the center
of the center of the center

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:34.680 align:middle line:90%
of that energetic center.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And so it's an
implosive movement.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.330 align:middle line:84%
It's going from
periphery to center.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that, you're moving
into higher consciousness.

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:44.610 align:middle line:90%
You're moving into other worlds.

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:49.500 align:middle line:84%
That's the method to be able to
navigate through higher realms.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.170 align:middle line:84%
That's where you're opening up
something like the pineal gland

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.960 align:middle line:84%
to be able to become
an organ of perception

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.230 align:middle line:84%
of non-physical realities
by going into the center,

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.130 align:middle line:90%
to the inner world.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And so some traditions
teach only that aspect.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Other traditions teach
only the next step of it,

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:08.610 align:middle line:84%
which is once you go all
the way into that center

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:11.910 align:middle line:84%
and you touch the divine plane,
it's like you've activated it,

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and then a flood of energy
comes out of that zero point.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:18.175 align:middle line:84%
So after you've gone into the
center of the Cave of Brahma,

00:30:18.175 --> 00:30:19.550 align:middle line:84%
you can get the
point that you've

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:23.000 align:middle line:84%
reached that absolute center,
and the natural countermovement

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.110 align:middle line:90%
then happens.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.120 align:middle line:84%
That countermovement,
now it's from the center

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.040 align:middle line:90%
outward to the periphery.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.915 align:middle line:84%
And some traditions
teach only that movement.

00:30:29.915 --> 00:30:31.665 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what
is the purpose of that

00:30:31.665 --> 00:30:32.480 align:middle line:90%
countermovement?

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: The
countermovement is what I refer

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:35.540 align:middle line:90%
to as the radiance movement.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, because
some would call it Kundalini,

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.110 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Well--

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.902 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --Kundalini
awakening, casually speaking.

00:30:41.902 --> 00:30:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: It's absolutely
related to Kundalini awakening,

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.760 align:middle line:84%
although that process has
some other elements to it.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:49.985 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: So what we're
talking about here is I call it

00:30:49.985 --> 00:30:51.440 align:middle line:90%
zero-point centering.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.630 align:middle line:84%
What all these traditions
teach, mostly in the East,

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:55.760 align:middle line:84%
about going into the
center of the center,

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.802 align:middle line:84%
and then you're traveling
through the inner world

00:30:57.802 --> 00:31:00.200 align:middle line:84%
and you're activating the
gland, the organ, whatever

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.380 align:middle line:84%
it might be to become an
organ of spiritual perception.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Then from that center,
once it's triggered,

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.420 align:middle line:84%
you have that second movement
that the Western traditions

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.030 align:middle line:84%
tend to focus on where
it's moving outward

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:14.450 align:middle line:84%
and becomes a sphere
of light and energy.

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So for example, in the
Greek-Christian Hermetic

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:21.980 align:middle line:84%
tradition with the teacher
Stylianos of Atteshlis

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:26.300 align:middle line:84%
from Cyprus, who was known to
the public as Daskalos, great

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Greek Christian
Hermetic teacher.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:31.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things he would
teach in his initiation school

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.820 align:middle line:84%
is, he didn't teach going into
the center, only out from it.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And you go out from the center
and you create a golden sphere

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:41.330 align:middle line:84%
around the head, a rose
sphere around the chest

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and around the heart,
and a blue sphere

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:47.050 align:middle line:84%
around the lower abdomen,
mostly to calm those energies.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But what you're doing is you're
then allowing those energies

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.420 align:middle line:84%
that you've tapped
into by opening up

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:57.140 align:middle line:84%
that divine gate in
the center to flood out

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and to actually become part
of your energetic field.

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And so your energetic
field expands,

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.010 align:middle line:84%
and the vibrational qualities
from that expansion,

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:05.990 align:middle line:84%
like the gold sphere
around the head,

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:08.210 align:middle line:84%
then begins to
literally illuminate

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:10.530 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts and
our consciousness.

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:12.350 align:middle line:10%
So we need to have
an understanding

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:13.630 align:middle line:10%
of the complete movement.

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Again, most traditions just
go in or they just go out.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:19.640 align:middle line:84%
But I like to teach it
as a complete movement.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Going into the center til
you reach that true divine--

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
condensation, Yeah.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Yes.

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And then it expands
back outward.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a
breathing process,

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:32.330 align:middle line:84%
just like we breathe in and
we breathe out and we contract

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:33.710 align:middle line:90%
and we expand.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:35.730 align:middle line:84%
That's true for all
of these things.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So if we see something
like the point

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.190 align:middle line:84%
in the center of
the circle and then

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.870 align:middle line:84%
the point in the
center of the sphere,

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:44.630 align:middle line:84%
that's one very
practical example.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:46.200 align:middle line:84%
This would be like
my first example,

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.900 align:middle line:84%
but it could be
hundreds of others

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.610 align:middle line:84%
for how that would then be
applied to the human energy

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:50.410 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:54.290 align:middle line:84%
For Kundalini, then that would
be related to another question,

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and that is, what are the
main methods for activating

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:00.050 align:middle line:90%
the entire energy system?

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And the three
primary methods are

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.720 align:middle line:84%
you can do it from
below-upwards, which you find

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.240 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of older
Asian traditions,

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.640 align:middle line:84%
and that is opening
up the original divine

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.630 align:middle line:84%
fire, of course, in the
tailbone and the sacrum.

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you're sending
the energy up the spine

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:21.260 align:middle line:84%
and also activating the
ida-pingala channels

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:26.270 align:middle line:84%
as it's going up and conducing
through the different chakras

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:29.270 align:middle line:84%
until you can then reach the
points in the head to get

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:31.230 align:middle line:90%
a full illumination process.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:34.610 align:middle line:84%
So you have below-upwards
with Kundalini activation

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:36.830 align:middle line:90%
as one possible method.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Then later Western traditions
tended to focus on a top-down

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:43.580 align:middle line:84%
method, and that was symbolized
in the Christian ministries

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.570 align:middle line:90%
as showing--

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:47.060 align:middle line:84%
and you see this in very
ancient illustrations where

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:49.490 align:middle line:84%
there is a pillar of
light around Jesus

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:51.770 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the
baptism in the Jordan.

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's the dove of the
Holy Spirit descending down

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.210 align:middle line:90%
into his crown chakra.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And at the time of
the crucifixion,

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:03.380 align:middle line:84%
it's described that the veil
that covered the Holy of Holies

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.240 align:middle line:84%
in the Temple of
Solomon was rent

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.410 align:middle line:90%
from the top to the bottom.

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And so that's opening up the
energy system from the crown

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.020 align:middle line:90%
center downward.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So you have
below-upwards, top-down,

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.630 align:middle line:84%
but then there's another one
that's not as well-known, which

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:19.790 align:middle line:90%
is from center-outward.

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And the center-outward is
perfectly described in what

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:26.330 align:middle line:84%
the Rosicrucians and Rudolf
Steiner called the six basic

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:29.630 align:middle line:84%
or the six essential exercises
where you're given six

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:34.489 align:middle line:84%
exercises that develop certain
lotus petals of the 12--

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:36.679 align:middle line:90%
petal lotus of the heart chakra.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:38.840 align:middle line:10%
And you then activate
the heart chakra

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.679 align:middle line:10%
as the first thing you do.

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And then that creates
an organizing center

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:45.020 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of
the energy system.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And they explain that
until you have that,

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.130 align:middle line:84%
you don't really have
an organizing center

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.989 align:middle line:84%
to keep all the
other activations

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:52.469 align:middle line:90%
in the right balance.

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:54.739 align:middle line:84%
And so they do it
from center-outward.

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And so again, that's
seeing things contextually.

00:34:56.870 --> 00:35:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Most traditions only talk about
below-up, top-down, sometimes

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:03.590 align:middle line:84%
center-out, but I
think it's important

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:05.510 align:middle line:84%
that people, if they're
going to have freedom,

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:07.610 align:middle line:84%
they have to understand
the full context.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Here is the owner's
manual, here's

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:12.410 align:middle line:84%
the blueprint for the ways
that you could approach this.

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't heard anyone
explain it in this way before.

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
flashing on this as you

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:22.550 align:middle line:84%
were talking about geometry
and subliminal use of geometry

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:23.730 align:middle line:90%
in the development--

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Rudolf Steiner,
for example, my son

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:29.320 align:middle line:84%
went through the water
system from kindergarten on.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And what I always
found interesting

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:37.030 align:middle line:84%
was the rounding off of the
corners on all the papers

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:40.240 align:middle line:84%
until the mind and the
being reached a certain age,

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.330 align:middle line:84%
so that it did not create
linear thinking, rather

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:46.540 align:middle line:84%
expansive creative
thinking in the young mind.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And so it was
completely subliminal.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:50.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you were
to do it right now

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and take this piece of paper,
cut the corners off, round

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:56.590 align:middle line:84%
all the corners off on it, it's
a completely different feeling

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:58.322 align:middle line:84%
of the interface
with that paper.

00:35:58.322 --> 00:35:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Absolutely.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And these are very
simple subliminal ways in which

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Steiner used in his
system geometry.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:08.650 align:middle line:10%
>> GILBERT: Absolutely.

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:13.060 align:middle line:84%
So one particular anecdote from
Steiner's geometric work, which

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm a huge fan of, I think it
was absolutely brilliant, he

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.470 align:middle line:84%
had a private initiation
school from 1904 to 1914,

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and then it ended with the
beginning of World War I.

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:25.240 align:middle line:84%
But this went beyond what
he taught people publicly.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.600 align:middle line:84%
These were people that were
like his private initiate group.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And that material was
not available in English

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.850 align:middle line:84%
until like the last
10 years or so.

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:37.060 align:middle line:84%
It's only been very recently
translated into English.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And so you find some
fascinating things in there.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Was this during
his like Viennese period

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.040 align:middle line:84%
in the coffeehouses where he
was starting to gather people

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.930 align:middle line:90%
to him as a young man?

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Was that in-- that must have
been in a relatively early

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.360 align:middle line:90%
phase of his--

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.943 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: It started in 1904,
so there's still some of that.

00:36:52.943 --> 00:36:55.150 align:middle line:84%
But he was beginning to
gain steam at that point.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:58.607 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And he was beginning
to have larger outlets.

00:36:58.607 --> 00:37:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that then led to
the building of the Goetheanum

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.990 align:middle line:90%
in Switzerland.

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And all
of that geometry.

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:05.950 align:middle line:84%
But on this
particular trajectory,

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:07.900 align:middle line:84%
looking at what he
was teaching people

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:11.830 align:middle line:84%
about this very advanced form
of spiritual sacred geometry

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:14.740 align:middle line:84%
in his private
initiation school,

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:18.860 align:middle line:84%
there were debates that I
recall in the 1980s, 1990s

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.520 align:middle line:84%
in modern metaphysics
about people

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.820 align:middle line:90%
talking about the Merkabah.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:23.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: And saying--

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.250 align:middle line:84%
one particular line of
thought is, well, the Merkabah

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:28.667 align:middle line:84%
is based on the
star tetrahedral--

00:37:28.667 --> 00:37:29.833 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right here, yeah.

00:37:29.833 --> 00:37:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: It based
on a six-pointed star.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And another person
would say, no,

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.660 align:middle line:90%
it's based on the phi ratio.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.880 align:middle line:84%
It's based on a
five-pointed star.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And what you find in Steiner's
work is he-- it gives you,

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.090 align:middle line:90%
once again, the larger context.

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:42.410 align:middle line:90%
These are fragments.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And so what he
shows very clearly

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:48.340 align:middle line:84%
is the classical teaching, which
is that the five-pointed star

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:51.220 align:middle line:84%
is a form that actually
activates and works

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:54.430 align:middle line:84%
in the circulation of
the human etheric body,

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:57.140 align:middle line:84%
and the six-pointed
star activates and works

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.350 align:middle line:84%
with the circulation of
the human astral body.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So they're both a part of a
much larger what we might call

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Merkabah or Merkavah process.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:08.830 align:middle line:84%
But they're at different
planes, different levels.

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And so once you start looking
at different planes of existence

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and different human
subtle bodies,

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:16.600 align:middle line:84%
the geometries change
for the different levels.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.970 align:middle line:84%
But that's not always explained
in the public material.

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:20.740 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, why am I seeing
all these different patterns.

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: Sometimes they
align in another hidden way that

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:28.750 align:middle line:84%
really becomes, once again, the
owner's manual for the initiate

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:31.630 align:middle line:90%
to do highly precise work.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And in his
own work of the day--

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and I would just bring this
up so people can go online

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:40.300 align:middle line:84%
and take a peek at what the
original Goetheanum looked like

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.300 align:middle line:84%
before it burned down, two
interlocking domes with no

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.590 align:middle line:90%
visible means of support.

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Absolutely.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I went to his library
in Dornoch many years ago,

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:54.040 align:middle line:90%
and talk about prolific.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, they were
essentially channelings.

00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:58.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was just
streaming and downloading

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:01.400 align:middle line:90%
this information to thousands--

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were
thousands of documents

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.510 align:middle line:90%
that had come from him.

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And there's over 350
published books of either books

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:09.288 align:middle line:90%
he wrote or collected lectures.

00:39:09.288 --> 00:39:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, collected
lectures as well.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a library full
of this, and I certainly

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:15.730 align:middle line:90%
encourage anybody to begin--

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.730 align:middle line:84%
what would you say to begin
with as a primal work of his

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.770 align:middle line:84%
if someone was interested
in studying Steiner?

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: That's
a great question,

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:25.840 align:middle line:84%
because what I find in orthodox
Steiner circles is that they

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.500 align:middle line:84%
tend to recommend these
extremely dense books that are

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.570 align:middle line:84%
called the basic
books of Steiner.

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:33.408 align:middle line:84%
And while they are
important, they--

00:39:33.408 --> 00:39:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They're tough.

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: They just
bounce people off of them

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:38.170 align:middle line:90%
because they're so dense.

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:41.620 align:middle line:84%
So like "Philosophy of Freedom,"
"Outline of Occult Science,"

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.868 align:middle line:84%
brilliant texts,
but really dense.

00:39:43.868 --> 00:39:45.910 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not recommending
those as where to start.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:47.650 align:middle line:84%
That's what you tend to
get recommended if you go

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:49.030 align:middle line:90%
to an anthropological outlet.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What
would you recommend?

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: I recommend a book
called "Founding a Science

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:53.800 align:middle line:90%
of the Spirit."

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: Which is a
series of lectures he gave,

00:39:56.390 --> 00:40:00.010 align:middle line:84%
which is extremely easy to
access and people can absorb it

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:00.850 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: "Founding
a Science of Spirit?"

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Yes.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.450 align:middle line:84%
"Founding a Science of
the Spirit" by Steiner.

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Great series of lectures.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And another one that's really
fascinating and very easy

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:14.380 align:middle line:84%
to absorb is written
by someone who

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.360 align:middle line:84%
attended early
lecture cycles of his

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.800 align:middle line:84%
and was a writer,
Edouard Schure.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And Edouard Schure wrote a book
called "An Esoteric Cosmology."

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How do you
spell his last name?

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: S-C-H-U-R-E.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No one would
have guessed that one.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.600 align:middle line:90%
Edouard Schure.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.892 align:middle line:90%
And the name of the book again?

00:40:33.892 --> 00:40:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: "An
Esoteric Cosmology."

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.468 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: In modern form,
sometimes they might just

00:40:38.468 --> 00:40:40.820 align:middle line:84%
attribute it to Steiner
because it's like straight from

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:41.650 align:middle line:90%
Steiner's lectures.

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, right.

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: But these two
books, "Founding a Science

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:45.680 align:middle line:84%
of the Spirit" and "An
Esoteric Cosmology,"

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.900 align:middle line:84%
I find people can
absorb very easily.

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're full of
fascinating insights.

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So for example, in "An
Esoteric Cosmology"

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.968 align:middle line:84%
is where they have the
summary knowledge about what

00:40:55.968 --> 00:40:58.010 align:middle line:84%
for the Rosicrucians does
the point in the center

00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:59.210 align:middle line:90%
of the circle mean?

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:01.983 align:middle line:84%
Six-pointed star mean and
the five-pointed star mean.

00:41:01.983 --> 00:41:03.650 align:middle line:84%
I just talked about
the five and the six

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:05.900 align:middle line:84%
related to the different
levels of subtle bodies.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.640 align:middle line:84%
There's another
level of it, which

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:10.015 align:middle line:84%
is at the point of the center
of the circle they consider

00:41:10.015 --> 00:41:11.810 align:middle line:90%
to be the form of the godhead.

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Then the six-pointed
star is related

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:17.360 align:middle line:84%
to the form of the macrocosm,
and the five-pointed star

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:18.950 align:middle line:90%
for the microcosm.

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So very clear, concise
summary information.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in "Founding a
Science of the Spirit,"

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:27.200 align:middle line:84%
there's a discussion
where Steiner

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:32.900 align:middle line:84%
talks about the forms
of the human astral body

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and how this was
related at one level

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.010 align:middle line:84%
to this egg-shaped
aura, like you

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.720 align:middle line:84%
see in all the
theosophical paintings,

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:42.470 align:middle line:84%
but at another level to the
six-pointed star structure

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and to the activation of
particular nodal points

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:50.270 align:middle line:84%
in the human energy body
related to a harmonic of three

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and three nodal points
in the energy body

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.470 align:middle line:90%
that the astral body roots in.

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:58.580 align:middle line:84%
So in the head and the
heart and in the liver.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And so that three-fold division
of the soul is something

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.580 align:middle line:84%
you find in many
traditions, but Steiner

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.610 align:middle line:84%
has a particular way
of going into deeper

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:09.270 align:middle line:90%
levels of these things.

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And so again, as a
contextual knowledge,

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.710 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the work
from the Rosicrucians,

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:18.170 align:middle line:84%
they'll talk about the three
aspects of the human soul

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:20.450 align:middle line:84%
being thinking,
feeling, and willing,

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:23.000 align:middle line:84%
and with anchor points
in those three levels.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But those same three levels
become the three Dantian,

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:28.580 align:middle line:84%
in the three elixir fields
for internal alchemy

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:32.150 align:middle line:84%
for the Chinese with the upper,
middle, and lower Dantian,

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:33.380 align:middle line:90%
same areas.

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.230 align:middle line:84%
For the Sufis, they talk
about the head, the heart.

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And because in some
of the religions that

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:45.080 align:middle line:84%
don't like to deal too much
externally with sexuality,

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.850 align:middle line:84%
they don't talk about
the lower abdomen.

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Instead they talk about
the metabolic forces

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.320 align:middle line:84%
in the lower abdomen
expressing through the hands.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So for the Sufis, it's
head, heart, and hands.

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So once you
understand the pattern

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:57.380 align:middle line:84%
that they're all
based on, you can

00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.130 align:middle line:84%
see how all of these
traditions are really

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:02.520 align:middle line:90%
talking about the same thing.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And so once you get
a pattern knowledge,

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's the type of sacred
geometry as a divine language

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:09.770 align:middle line:84%
that we were talking about,
if you have pattern knowledge,

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:12.000 align:middle line:84%
you can study any
tradition in the world

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.467 align:middle line:84%
and you can see how the
pieces fit together.

00:43:15.467 --> 00:43:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing I was
always fascinated by

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.510 align:middle line:84%
is when I studied
science, every year,

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:22.970 align:middle line:84%
new discoveries in science are
integrated into the main body

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:24.060 align:middle line:90%
of knowledge.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So they have to keep updating
the textbooks all of the time,

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.820 align:middle line:84%
because we just learn something
new in biology, chemistry,

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:30.840 align:middle line:90%
and physics.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.230 align:middle line:84%
But in metaphysics,
there tends to be

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:35.330 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of "The
Lord of the Rings,"

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:37.130 align:middle line:90%
my precious kind of thing.

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Like this is my
body of knowledge.

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And we-- new things come
out, new discoveries,

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:46.600 align:middle line:84%
but we don't tend to unify
it into a collective body

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:47.400 align:middle line:90%
of knowledge.

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where mature
metaphysics needs to get to.

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.640 align:middle line:84%
We can't have this protectionist
attitude towards something

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.520 align:middle line:84%
that we feel we have
exclusive knowledge of.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.140 align:middle line:84%
That's not the time
for-- this isn't

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:01.370 align:middle line:90%
the time for that anymore.

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:02.690 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you totally.

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, I would like to
thank you for all that.

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:07.640 align:middle line:84%
I think people have to go back
and listen a few times just

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:10.100 align:middle line:84%
to this first part
of our conversation

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.390 align:middle line:90%
to really take it in.

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:15.950 align:middle line:84%
But let's move on to an
extension of that biogeometry

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:17.040 align:middle line:90%
in Dr. Karim's work.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Yes.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: So I was very
blessed as I was teaching

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:28.460 align:middle line:84%
sacred geometry in the year 2000
that someone mentioned to me

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.678 align:middle line:84%
about the work of Doctor
Ibrahim Karim from Cairo, Egypt,

00:44:31.678 --> 00:44:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and said, oh, he's just starting
to come to the United States

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:38.870 align:middle line:84%
to teach some of his work in
biogeometry and that this work

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:41.840 align:middle line:84%
is an absolute breakthrough
in understanding the true

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.020 align:middle line:84%
energetics behind
all of these forms.

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.240 align:middle line:84%
So of course I
immediately made a beeline

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.890 align:middle line:84%
for his next course,
which at that time

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:52.610 align:middle line:84%
was in Clearwater, Florida
with the Baubiologie Institute,

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:55.310 align:middle line:84%
because baubiologie is the
German system of building

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:56.420 align:middle line:90%
ecology.

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Not only how do you use healthy
building materials, but also

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:02.780 align:middle line:84%
how do you ameliorate
electromagnetic pollution.

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:03.780 align:middle line:90%
And so they understood--

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Big issue now.

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: So they understood
the importance of what Dr.

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Karim was doing
with biogeometry,

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.630 align:middle line:84%
because he wasn't focusing
on that so much as the actual

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:15.770 align:middle line:84%
energetic power and effects of
all of the shapes and the forms

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:18.350 align:middle line:84%
that you were using in
the interior design,

00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:22.010 align:middle line:84%
the architecture, and even
things inside the human energy

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.680 align:middle line:90%
body itself based on form.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I then simply,
every he would come teach,

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:31.060 align:middle line:84%
he couldn't get rid of
me, I was always there.

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was, again, very fortunate
that several years later he

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.540 align:middle line:84%
invited me to be the first
person outside of Egypt

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.850 align:middle line:90%
to teach his work publicly.

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
doing that in 2003.

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been working with
him and learning from him

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.540 align:middle line:84%
and teaching his work
for the last 20 years.

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I just had him
at my online summer conference

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:57.180 align:middle line:84%
a couple of months ago where
he gave the keynote talk.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.875 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a huge fan
of Ibrahim's work

00:45:58.875 --> 00:46:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and I'm happy to discuss
any part of that you

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:01.500 align:middle line:90%
might be interested in.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I think for
the people watching this,

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:05.760 align:middle line:84%
they're probably going to
always be most interested

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.720 align:middle line:84%
in the practical applications
of the work, of all work.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Absolutely.

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In the whole news
you can use thing, right?

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Yes, absolutely.

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So one thing that we sometimes
find with sacred geometry

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:22.410 align:middle line:84%
is that in some bodies of work,
it could be fairly abstract.

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And with Ibrahim-- he doesn't
call it sacred geometry,

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:29.340 align:middle line:84%
by the way, but again,
his term is biogeometry.

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with
the effects of shapes

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and their energetic
emissions on life functions.

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:37.410 align:middle line:84%
That's what
biogeochemistry really is.

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And he's been able
to demonstrate

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:42.090 align:middle line:84%
for well over 20
years in projects

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:44.400 align:middle line:84%
all over the Middle
East and Europe

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.580 align:middle line:84%
that he can create changes in
the life functions of living

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:52.680 align:middle line:84%
beings from particular geometric
forms and their emissions.

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how
are they utilized?

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:57.168 align:middle line:84%
How are they expressed so that a
person can be affected by them?

00:46:57.168 --> 00:46:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Let me give--

00:46:58.210 --> 00:46:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The mechanism.

00:46:58.890 --> 00:46:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: --a little
bit of background,

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and then the mechanism
will make more sense.

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: Dr. Karim credits
the breakthrough work of French

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:09.900 align:middle line:84%
researchers in the early part
of the 1900s in developing what

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:11.940 align:middle line:84%
they called physical
radiesthesia.

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And he says that he
took that work further

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.030 align:middle line:90%
to make biogeometry.

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:19.457 align:middle line:84%
And so the physical radiesthesia
uses things like pendulums

00:47:19.457 --> 00:47:20.540 align:middle line:90%
and other types of small--

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:22.898 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which radionics
ultimately came from, right?

00:47:22.898 --> 00:47:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: That's right.

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And let's
definitely talk about that.

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.035 align:middle line:84%
That's a fascinating
story of how

00:47:27.035 --> 00:47:28.720 align:middle line:90%
radionics developed from it.

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.210 align:middle line:84%
But what the French
were doing is

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:34.650 align:middle line:84%
just as some of the people
involved in modern physics

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:36.540 align:middle line:84%
were actually, like
Werner Heisenberg,

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:39.120 align:middle line:84%
taking things from the
old Platonic knowledge

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:42.420 align:middle line:84%
of sacred geometry and
applying it to nuclear physics,

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.042 align:middle line:84%
and just like Buckminster
Fuller took that knowledge

00:47:45.042 --> 00:47:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and then created
the knowledge that

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:50.370 align:middle line:84%
became the foundation
for nanotechnology,

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:52.020 align:middle line:84%
the French were going
back and wanting

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.870 align:middle line:84%
to understand, what were they
doing with these patterns

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:58.290 align:middle line:90%
in China, in India, in Egypt?

00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Particularly Egypt
was their focus.

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And so they came
up with the concept

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:04.410 align:middle line:90%
of the shape-caused wave.

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:07.620 align:middle line:84%
The shape-caused wave is what
is the energetic emission

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:11.220 align:middle line:84%
coming from a particular
type of shape or form?

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And they then created
a whole series of tools

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:17.310 align:middle line:84%
to be able to identify
these subtle radiation,

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:21.090 align:middle line:84%
subtle vibrations coming
from the different shapes.

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And what they were working
with was the concept

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.940 align:middle line:84%
that we live in a world
of invisible vibrations,

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:29.520 align:middle line:84%
invisible radiations that
we don't have a sense

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:34.140 align:middle line:84%
organ to detect, and our fairly
crude electromagnetic materials

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:36.390 align:middle line:84%
only pick up the
Herzian waves that are

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:37.980 align:middle line:90%
slower than the speed of light.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:41.310 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of invisible
waves that affect living beings

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:43.560 align:middle line:84%
that cannot be picked up by
our modern electromagnetic

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.550 align:middle line:90%
equipment.

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And so they extended
the human energy field

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.410 align:middle line:84%
through these
forms, just as they

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:51.150 align:middle line:84%
proved that they
did in ancient Egypt

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:53.533 align:middle line:84%
and other ancient cultures,
to be able to pick up

00:48:53.533 --> 00:48:54.575 align:middle line:90%
these subtle vibrations--

00:48:54.575 --> 00:48:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Are you
speaking more divination?

00:48:56.550 --> 00:48:59.912 align:middle line:84%
Through divination or this
precursor to the divination?

00:48:59.912 --> 00:49:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: It's
a different track.

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: So the divination
is to be able then to determine

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:07.140 align:middle line:84%
the forces that are going to
lead to one particular outcome.

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: So the shape-caused
wave is the essential vibratory

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:14.880 align:middle line:84%
wave that carries with
it a sita, a power,

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:17.680 align:middle line:90%
a function along with it.

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And so the way that
I like to explain

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:23.410 align:middle line:84%
this is that if we look at
how did modern technology come

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:24.210 align:middle line:90%
about?

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:27.390 align:middle line:84%
The modern technology came
about by cracking the code

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:29.820 align:middle line:90%
of two essential spectrums.

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:31.860 align:middle line:84%
The first spectrum is
the spectrum of matter

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:33.580 align:middle line:90%
that we call the periodic table.

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:35.653 align:middle line:84%
Now we know every
type of matter that

00:49:35.653 --> 00:49:37.320 align:middle line:84%
exists in the physical
world that we can

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.653 align:middle line:90%
use for practical applications.

00:49:39.653 --> 00:49:41.070 align:middle line:84%
The other spectrum
is the spectrum

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:42.880 align:middle line:90%
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And so now we know all the
types of decayed Herzian waves

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:48.750 align:middle line:84%
that we can push through
wires or wires at least

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:51.540 align:middle line:84%
transmit to use with
those materials,

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:54.150 align:middle line:84%
and that's created everything
in our modern technology.

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So spectrum analysis
at the level

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.310 align:middle line:84%
of the subphysical,
the electromagnetic,

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:01.140 align:middle line:90%
and the physical itself.

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:02.670 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is,
that all of that

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:05.500 align:middle line:84%
work, as Dr. Karim will often
talk about in biogeometry--

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:08.340 align:middle line:84%
so this is all
leading to his work,

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:10.590 align:middle line:84%
if you only focus on
those levels and nothing

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:12.960 align:middle line:84%
beyond the physical,
they're not studying

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.900 align:middle line:84%
the effect of the harm
on biological life,

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:19.500 align:middle line:84%
that the use of these physical
materials on the periodic table

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:23.250 align:middle line:84%
and the electromagnetic energy
radiations are creating.

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:24.900 align:middle line:84%
So we're creating
technologies that

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:27.350 align:middle line:84%
are antithetical to human life
and all life on the planet

00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and are killing life on
the planet very quickly.

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.087 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: So we have to
bring in what they focused

00:50:32.087 --> 00:50:35.140 align:middle line:84%
on in the ancient world, and
that was the level of the life

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:36.820 align:middle line:90%
force, the vital energy.

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, when I took my
Biology 101 class in college,

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.290 align:middle line:84%
the first thing that they said
on the first day of Biology 101

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:46.330 align:middle line:90%
is biology is the study of life.

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, great,
I'm in the right place.

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:50.830 align:middle line:84%
But the next thing they
said is that, however, there

00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:52.270 align:middle line:90%
was no such thing as life.

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:54.693 align:middle line:84%
Life is only a series
of mechanical processes.

00:50:54.693 --> 00:50:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you believe that
such a thing as life exists,

00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:59.560 align:middle line:84%
you were a victim of
the vitalist fallacy.

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:01.028 align:middle line:84%
And so I immediately
recognized I

00:51:01.028 --> 00:51:02.570 align:middle line:84%
was a victim of the
vitalist fallacy,

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:04.540 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't planning on changing.

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:06.560 align:middle line:84%
But we have to bring
in this next level.

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's what the French
were actually up to.

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:11.410 align:middle line:84%
They were up to, how
am I going to identify

00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:15.610 align:middle line:84%
the complete spectrum of these
invisible energies that affect

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:18.110 align:middle line:84%
living beings all the time and
we have no frame of reference

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:18.910 align:middle line:90%
for?

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And then combine it
with the knowledge

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:23.240 align:middle line:84%
of the electromagnetic
and physical spectrums.

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.890 align:middle line:84%
So they had to create spectrum
analysis for life energy

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:30.010 align:middle line:84%
itself, which I think is
tremendously exciting,

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:32.830 align:middle line:84%
and I spent a lot of
my own research time on

00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:36.580 align:middle line:84%
to be able to understand,
how can we bring together

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:38.685 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge from traditions
all over the world--

00:51:38.685 --> 00:51:40.060 align:middle line:84%
like how would
you bring together

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:41.740 align:middle line:90%
Chinese medicine and Ayurveda?

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:43.750 align:middle line:84%
One divides phenomena
into three parts.

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Another divides it
into five parts.

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:48.100 align:middle line:84%
If you bring it together
into the complete spectrum

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:50.290 align:middle line:84%
of all vital life
energies identified

00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:53.050 align:middle line:84%
by the French in
the 1930s, then you

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:55.240 align:middle line:84%
can bring together
any body of work

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:57.813 align:middle line:84%
and put it together into
that complete spectrum.

00:51:57.813 --> 00:51:59.980 align:middle line:84%
You can test their tools,
you can test their methods

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and identify every
band of vibration

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:04.360 align:middle line:84%
based on what the
French accomplished.

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim learned about
this from his friend

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:10.810 align:middle line:84%
who was a Coptic Christian
medical doctor in Egypt.

00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And he became fascinated
by physical radiesthesia.

00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Karim's an
incredible man anyway.

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:19.160 align:middle line:90%
He has a very unusual biography.

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.760 align:middle line:84%
He was recognized by all kinds
of people from a young age

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.550 align:middle line:84%
as being a very
significant individuality.

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So he picked up
on this knowledge

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:31.630 align:middle line:84%
that the French had
developed, and over decades,

00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:32.960 align:middle line:90%
developed it further.

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:38.283 align:middle line:84%
And so he began to understand in
addition to the spectrum of all

00:52:38.283 --> 00:52:39.700 align:middle line:84%
the different
powers and functions

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:42.850 align:middle line:84%
that the French identified,
all of which are polarized

00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:47.200 align:middle line:84%
vibrations that either make
things more yin or more yang

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.760 align:middle line:84%
or they activate
or sedate, they're

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:51.310 align:middle line:84%
within a polarity
system like everything

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:53.560 align:middle line:84%
in our manifest
polarity world is.

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.190 align:middle line:84%
But he said they
missed something.

00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim said they missed
this essential component

00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:59.300 align:middle line:90%
of what's in the center?

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And so he did all
this work to identify,

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:05.025 align:middle line:84%
what's the vibrational power
and the qualities in the center

00:53:05.025 --> 00:53:06.400 align:middle line:84%
and developed his
concept that he

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.470 align:middle line:84%
calls BG3, which
is starting to look

00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:12.080 align:middle line:84%
at the qualities of
that original center.

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.370 align:middle line:84%
What is this universal
harmonizing force that

00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:17.560 align:middle line:90%
balances all living systems?

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:18.873 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter what they are.

00:53:18.873 --> 00:53:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And you learn that the
higher levels of biogeometry,

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:23.770 align:middle line:84%
it's really all going back
to that literal center

00:53:23.770 --> 00:53:27.130 align:middle line:84%
of everything, which
is the divine plane.

00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim likes to
say that the center is

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:31.940 align:middle line:84%
a transcendental gateway
beyond space and time,

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and he means it
completely literally,

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and he can apply
it quite literally.

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a way that
you can harmonize or balance

00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:40.390 align:middle line:84%
any energetic
system-- that's what

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting to
here when you say,

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:43.180 align:middle line:90%
what's the practical aspect?

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:46.030 align:middle line:84%
You can apply that
vibratory power,

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:47.800 align:middle line:84%
or what he would call
an energy quality,

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:51.130 align:middle line:84%
from the center to any
other energetic system--

00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:53.890 align:middle line:84%
to a human being, to an
electromagnetic field,

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:57.340 align:middle line:84%
to toxic Earth energies,
doesn't matter what it is.

00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:01.180 align:middle line:84%
You can put it into connection
with that universal harmonizing

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:06.400 align:middle line:84%
force that literally centers
and balances all living systems.

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, you're going
to get at least a reduction

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:13.060 align:middle line:84%
of the toxic effects
and you're going

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:15.470 align:middle line:90%
to help to rebalance the system.

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So using that
knowledge developed

00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:19.090 align:middle line:84%
by the French of all the
different bands and all

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:22.202 align:middle line:84%
the different things they
do, and then his discovery

00:54:22.202 --> 00:54:23.410 align:middle line:90%
of the energy of the center--

00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:26.040 align:middle line:84%
he created biogeometry,
and he found

00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:28.540 align:middle line:84%
that using some of the French
work where they had identified

00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:31.450 align:middle line:84%
that one band in creation, very
much connected to what we've

00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:34.120 align:middle line:84%
rediscovered today as
electromagnetic energy,

00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:37.150 align:middle line:84%
has a very powerful
carrier wave energy.

00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And we can use that
particular band of energy

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:42.580 align:middle line:84%
the French identified
to transmit

00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:46.360 align:middle line:84%
that energy of the sintering,
harmonizing force even

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.740 align:middle line:90%
at a distance.

00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And so he's been able to do
practical things in which he,

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:55.180 align:middle line:84%
for example, balanced
two towns in Switzerland

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:57.340 align:middle line:84%
and balanced the
electromagnetic pollution

00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:58.990 align:middle line:90%
over the entire towns.

00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And so what we teach in
our classes on this--

00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:02.830 align:middle line:84%
because we teach
online the foundation

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and advanced levels of
this, and if people finish

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:07.390 align:middle line:84%
the advanced level, they
can become a practitioner

00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:09.970 align:middle line:84%
or do occasional classes
with Dr. Karim himself

00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:13.180 align:middle line:84%
because he only teaches
like very advanced stuff.

00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:16.810 align:middle line:84%
But it teaches you how to apply
this in your home or office,

00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:19.600 align:middle line:84%
to balance all the
energetics in the space.

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.940 align:middle line:84%
So this can be done through
a variety of methods.

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was just
going to ask that.

00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:23.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:55:23.530 --> 00:55:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: Certain
types of shapes--

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: --that
have the effect that--

00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:29.810 align:middle line:84%
one of the keys to
this is you have

00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:32.420 align:middle line:84%
the shape that has a particular
type of vibratory emanation

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:33.800 align:middle line:84%
that you need to
balance whatever

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.300 align:middle line:90%
the harmful effects are.

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:37.508 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that has to
be identified first, right?

00:55:37.508 --> 00:55:39.758 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And we've
identified a huge amount of that

00:55:39.758 --> 00:55:40.610 align:middle line:90%
in biogeometry.

00:55:40.610 --> 00:55:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: All right.

00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And so with that,
in identifying what that

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:48.320 align:middle line:84%
particular vibrational
quality is,

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:52.580 align:middle line:84%
one of the key principles is
the one of, you have to put

00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:56.570 align:middle line:84%
the transmuting form in the
line of energy conduction that

00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:57.920 align:middle line:90%
you're wanting to transmute.

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Because a common mistake people
will make today is they'll--

00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:03.700 align:middle line:84%
there's a bazillion different
types of vibrational tools

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:04.500 align:middle line:90%
that people--

00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And so you buy
somebody this vibrational tool

00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:09.157 align:middle line:84%
and they say this will transmute
all the electromagnetics,

00:56:09.157 --> 00:56:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and then a person just gets
it and randomly places that

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:16.393 align:middle line:84%
on the outer edge of
a 70-inch plasma TV.

00:56:16.393 --> 00:56:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And they put it
there and I think,

00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:20.430 align:middle line:84%
oh, it's completely
corrected and I'm protected.

00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:23.262 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume that it's a
tool that actually works instead

00:56:23.262 --> 00:56:24.470 align:middle line:90%
of the tools that don't work.

00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:26.293 align:middle line:84%
Let's assume it's one
that actually works.

00:56:26.293 --> 00:56:27.710 align:middle line:84%
But putting it on
that outer edge,

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:29.600 align:middle line:84%
it's not in the line
of energy conduction

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:31.100 align:middle line:90%
coming from the plasma TV.

00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So when I come in and I test
it with the radiesthesia tools,

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.285 align:middle line:90%
it's not transmuted.

00:56:35.285 --> 00:56:38.090 align:middle line:84%
The person is still getting all
of the toxic energetic effects

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:39.350 align:middle line:90%
from the plasma TV.

00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:42.380 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to put it in the
line of energy conduction

00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:44.340 align:middle line:90%
to make the transformation.

00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a matter
of knowing where

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:51.890 align:middle line:84%
to place the corrections so
that the harmonizing energy gets

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:56.150 align:middle line:84%
transmitted through whatever is
the power flow of that problem,

00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:58.220 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
Earth energy line that

00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:01.220 align:middle line:84%
has a toxic effect, whether
it's electromagnetic fields,

00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:05.800 align:middle line:84%
wireless or wired, or even
things in the human body.

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What if-- does
it even extend beyond that?

00:57:08.330 --> 00:57:10.280 align:middle line:84%
To realms beyond
of other beings?

00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Even interference from dark
forces, so to speak, you know?

00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>> GILBERT: Absolutely.

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:15.950 align:middle line:84%
But that's the more
esoteric part of this.

00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:18.337 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: We don't
always start there,

00:57:18.337 --> 00:57:20.120 align:middle line:84%
but that's definitely
where things go to.

00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:22.970 align:middle line:84%
So for example, Dr.
Karim describes the way

00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:28.130 align:middle line:84%
that he would often work with
Sufi esotericists in Egypt

00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:29.720 align:middle line:84%
and the Middle East,
and if they were

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:31.730 align:middle line:84%
doing a type of
exorcism of a person,

00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:35.372 align:middle line:84%
clearing certain detrimental
things from their field,

00:57:35.372 --> 00:57:36.830 align:middle line:84%
he doesn't claim
to be an exorcist,

00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:40.310 align:middle line:84%
he doesn't claim to be a Sufi,
he's a very humble person.

00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well what I can do
is I can bring in these things

00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:46.880 align:middle line:84%
and I can change the vibratory
field around the person

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.310 align:middle line:84%
so that these detrimental
influences have

00:57:49.310 --> 00:57:52.252 align:middle line:84%
a very hard time being
present in their field.

00:57:52.252 --> 00:57:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it's all a
question of resonance.

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: The very detrimental
qualities are in their field.

00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:58.100 align:middle line:84%
These things are
magnetically attracted to it.

00:57:58.100 --> 00:57:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:00.538 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And if you
can change the vibration

00:58:00.538 --> 00:58:03.560 align:middle line:84%
in the field to the one that's
like this literally a field

00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:05.660 align:middle line:84%
of gold, that golden
aura you see around--

00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: --that's
what we're working with.

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:09.128 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And once
you change that,

00:58:09.128 --> 00:58:10.670 align:middle line:84%
that's not what
they're attracted to.

00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:12.920 align:middle line:84%
They can't even
stay in that field.

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:17.240 align:middle line:10%
And he would give examples
of this where a person would

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:20.240 align:middle line:10%
put on a particular
pendant that he creates

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.885 align:middle line:10%
that has a very
strong field of that

00:58:21.885 --> 00:58:23.510 align:middle line:10%
and they'd act like
it was burning them

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:24.590 align:middle line:10%
and they threw it off.

00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: Because whatever was
with them, they couldn't stay--

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:28.100 align:middle line:90%
The

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Frequency
couldn't stand it.

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>> GILBERT: And it's
not only in people,

00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:32.297 align:middle line:84%
but also on Earth
lines and things, too.

00:58:32.297 --> 00:58:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Things will nest in
the Earth lines that

00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:36.510 align:middle line:90%
will get lifted off from this.

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Robert, you're
just-- you're magnificent.

00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:41.330 align:middle line:90%
It's so much information.

00:58:41.330 --> 00:58:44.330 align:middle line:84%
We're out of time and
we've barely begun.

00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:46.040 align:middle line:84%
