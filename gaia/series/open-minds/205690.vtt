>>GATES MCKIBBIN: I could
receive guidance and insight so

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.400 align:middle line:90%
abundantly from the other side.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.570 align:middle line:84%
I grabbed a pad of paper and
a pen and sat down on my sofa,

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.940 align:middle line:84%
cleared my mind, and Thomas
Jefferson introduced himself.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.860 align:middle line:84%
I was able to transcribe
what he dictated.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Abraham Lincoln showed up.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.280 align:middle line:84%
He was telling me
about his presidency.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Immediately, Eisenhower arrived.

That was the 9th
of September, 2001.

Oh, my goodness.

>>MCKIBBIN: I went back to their
messages and knew it was time.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.080 align:middle line:84%
We're constantly balancing
two opposite intentions.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: And yet
they're complementary.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Diversity is the best possible
ingredient for a democracy.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:84%
It requires us to be
tolerant and respectful

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.580 align:middle line:90%
of other viewpoints.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.430 align:middle line:84%
We're capable of living in
the light, of being light,

of seeing the stars, no
matter how dark it is.

>>REGINA: The word, "democracy,"
has been bandied about fiercely

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:84%
over the past year,
but do we even

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:90%
know what it means any longer?

Author, Gates McKibbin,
is here with us

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.320 align:middle line:10%
to offer some profound insights
into the spirit of democracy,

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.200 align:middle line:10%
from our personal lives to
our businesses, communities,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.270 align:middle line:10%
and, yeah, even the government.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.040 align:middle line:84%
She gained this insight
when in the middle

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.010 align:middle line:84%
of an intuitive session,
a long deceased president

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.320 align:middle line:84%
popped in and basically
said, we need to talk.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.343 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Gates.

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Thank you.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.218 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm so happy.

00:01:52.218 --> 00:01:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I've known about your work
and the channeling you've

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.930 align:middle line:84%
done with the-- we call
them the dead presidents--

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.000 align:middle line:84%
deceased presidents
for many years,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:90%
because we have a mutual friend.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.420 align:middle line:84%
But for years, I've
known about you.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And it took until now
to actually really get

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.610 align:middle line:84%
in touch with you and
bring your work forward.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's because you sat
on it for a lot of years.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:90%
You didn't do anything with it.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.260 align:middle line:84%
So let's let people get
to know you a bit first.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.170 align:middle line:90%
What were you doing?

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.590 align:middle line:84%
What was your real
life all about prior

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.020 align:middle line:84%
to all this stuff that
became known as channeling?

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: My real life
was in the corporate world.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.110 align:middle line:10%
I worked with major
corporations on large scale

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:10%
strategic change, and
life in the fast lane.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: I had a great
place in San Francisco, loved

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.640 align:middle line:84%
my life, but there also
was another facet to it.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.910 align:middle line:84%
I had built a relationship with
my father, my deceased father,

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:90%
over a number of years.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.490 align:middle line:84%
He sent me lots of
journal messages, which--

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But didn't you have
an incident where you got sick

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.232 align:middle line:84%
or something for a while and
kind of dropped out, kind of--

00:02:57.232 --> 00:02:58.065 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Exactly.

00:02:58.065 --> 00:03:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It kind of
thinned the barriers out,

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.820 align:middle line:90%
so to speak, between the worlds.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Beautiful.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: That's
exactly what happened.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.015 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us what happened.

00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:05.182 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, tell us what happened.

00:03:05.182 --> 00:03:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: I was in the fast
lane, in the corporate world,

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and the stress took
such a toll on me,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.250 align:middle line:84%
I ended up with pneumonia
that I couldn't get rid of.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And, finally, my doctor said,
you can either keep your job

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.770 align:middle line:90%
or get your health back.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Which will it be?

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.450 align:middle line:84%
So I quit my job and
started journaling.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Almost immediately, there I
was with no financial security,

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.820 align:middle line:84%
an insecure future, sick,
and, at the same time,

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:84%
through my journaling, my
father appeared and began

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.930 align:middle line:84%
to give me messages that
helped me through that very

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:90%
difficult time.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Not only that,
but actually freed

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.550 align:middle line:84%
me to become a very
different person,

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.270 align:middle line:84%
someone not so dependent
on my corporate career,

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.870 align:middle line:84%
although that continued
and remained successful,

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.640 align:middle line:90%
but with another foot--

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.860 align:middle line:84%
with my second foot
in another world,

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.380 align:middle line:84%
in a world where I could
receive guidance and insight

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.960 align:middle line:84%
and blessings so abundantly
from the other side.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and I've
gotten to know you a little bit

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.089 align:middle line:90%
over just the last few years.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know you
the previous 15 or 20

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.080 align:middle line:84%
when my friend would
tell me about your work

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and the channelings
that were occurring.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And what I can see,
and what everybody

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.380 align:middle line:84%
that comes in contact with you
feels, is this incredible--

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.870 align:middle line:84%
you're almost like
a little fairy,

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
sprightly kind of energy
that really reaches out

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.230 align:middle line:90%
into other realms.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, if I may,
without embarrassing you,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:84%
it's a very refined energy,
very highly aesthetically tuned,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.080 align:middle line:90%
very generous and kind.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.550 align:middle line:84%
So you're-- I'm setting this
up, because it seems to me you

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.080 align:middle line:84%
would be the kind of person
that that generosity,

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:84%
combined with incredible clarity
of mind and a strategic mind

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.380 align:middle line:84%
to boot, that if I
were a dead president,

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.960 align:middle line:84%
why wouldn't I want to come
through you, to you, right?

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, so because I
find it fascinating,

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.310 align:middle line:90%
it's like, why Gates?

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Why did these guys
come to Gates, right?

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And at first, when our mutual
friend told me about it, Susan,

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.100 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, everybody claims
to be channeling Marilyn Monroe

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:90%
and dead presidents and things.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.210 align:middle line:84%
But then when I saw
what came out of it,

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.550 align:middle line:84%
I realized this is--
that's not a joke.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:84%
You brought something really
truly pristine through.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: It was the summer
of 2001, so it's been 20 years.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was in my place
in San Francisco,

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and I felt a presence, a
strong, determined presence.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And recognizing that
something was afoot,

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:84%
I grabbed a pad of paper and
a pen and sat down on my sofa,

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.420 align:middle line:84%
cleared my mind, and Thomas
Jefferson introduced himself.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.070 align:middle line:90%
I was immediately intimidated.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.870 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: --how can--
how can I do this?

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But he-- I cleared
my mind again,

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.960 align:middle line:84%
and he started sending
messages to me that I wrote.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:84%
It's not really automatic
writing, but I can hear--

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.010 align:middle line:90%
it was as if I could--

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.940 align:middle line:84%
my mind could
hear, could discern

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.010 align:middle line:90%
what he wanted me to write.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And once we were able to
get our energies aligned,

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.160 align:middle line:84%
which didn't take
that long, I was

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.713 align:middle line:84%
able to transcribe
what he dictated.

00:06:37.713 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
the process is.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Literally, you
just-- yeah, exactly.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: That's all it is.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were the scribe.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: That's all I was.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, if I
can get through this

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:84%
and feel that I've
done an effective job,

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.500 align:middle line:90%
then I'll be so gratified.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.250 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
would happen with it,

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.510 align:middle line:84%
but I at least was committed
to working with him.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:90%
And we finished that.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:90%
I thought--

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So over
what period of time?

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.585 align:middle line:90%
Did he say why he came to you?

00:07:05.585 --> 00:07:06.710 align:middle line:90%
Did they ever tell you why?

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: No.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
just-- they just did.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.245 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: He just appeared
, and I think he was--

00:07:11.245 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle line:84%
he wasn't sure, maybe,
if I could do it,

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.610 align:middle line:84%
but the fact that I could, then
he said, OK, this is working.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's keep going.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And I had no information
about why, but I knew--

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.050 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't even matter why.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I knew that this was something
I needed to do to be of service

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.910 align:middle line:84%
and that I would
surrender it to the world

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.940 align:middle line:90%
whenever the time came.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:41.710 align:middle line:84%
When we were done,
Abraham Lincoln showed up.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And the difference in their
energies was so palpable to me.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Jefferson-- such a wise,
considerably thoughtful

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.300 align:middle line:90%
and articulate voice.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Every single word that
came out of his mouth

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.150 align:middle line:90%
had been intellectually refined.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a
true philosopher.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: A true philosopher.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Lincoln arrived
completely from the heart,

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.700 align:middle line:84%
completely from the
heart, and I was

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:21.210 align:middle line:84%
able to align my energy with him
and write his messages, which

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.770 align:middle line:84%
were difficult, because he was
telling me about his presidency

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.700 align:middle line:84%
and what he went through to
try to preserve the Union

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.390 align:middle line:84%
and what he, in fact, had
inherited when he became

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.990 align:middle line:84%
president-- a nation
divided, a nation divided

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:41.010 align:middle line:84%
because, fundamentally, the
founding fathers had not

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:45.190 align:middle line:84%
addressed the big
issue of slavery.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which still
is dogging us today.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:49.570 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into all of
this and what was said, yes.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Mm-hmm.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So Lincoln dictated
his messages.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.850 align:middle line:90%
I wrote them and felt a strong--

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.670 align:middle line:84%
such a strong heart
connection with him--

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:05.100 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of still grieving that
he was experiencing over what

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.690 align:middle line:90%
he went through as president.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And when I was finished
with him, it was--

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:84%
this was after about
five weeks in the summer

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.020 align:middle line:90%
and early fall of 2001.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.140 align:middle line:90%
I was exhausted, just exhausted.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.180 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, I can't--

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:84%
I can't work with anyone else,
so I hope no one else shows up.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.620 align:middle line:90%
Immediately, Eisenhower arrives.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING]

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: And he was ever
the commanding general.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pragmatic.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: OK, I'm ready.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'm not.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, you've got to do it.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Will you at least give me time
to have a good night's sleep?

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, but tomorrow morning,
we're going to get started.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.000 align:middle line:90%
And we did.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.190 align:middle line:84%
That was the 9th
of September, 2001.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my goodness.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:03.740 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: And we
worked that day.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.505 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: We
worked the next day.

00:10:08.505 --> 00:10:09.305 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:10:09.305 --> 00:10:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And 9/11.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: Then,
the next day, he--

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.540 align:middle line:84%
when I realized
what had happened,

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:84%
he said, so now do you know
why I was so insistent?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It almost
brings tears to my eyes.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: We had to do this--

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.737 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: --because
my message--

00:10:26.737 --> 00:10:30.750 align:middle line:84%
I had to manifest
on the Earth plane

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:84%
this message for everyone
that is so relevant.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's time for
people to hear it.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.270 align:middle line:90%
And he was-- he was that--

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:90%
he was that clear.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say
demanding, but he also

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:53.010 align:middle line:84%
wanted to let me know that once
these messages were written,

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:84%
then they could
make a difference.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And I, in fact, tried to publish
these presidents' messages

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.200 align:middle line:84%
almost immediately, but
there was no interest

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.750 align:middle line:90%
on the part of any publishers.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, I thought
to myself, well,

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.650 align:middle line:84%
I do have my corporate
credibility to consider.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: So they've
accepted the fact

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.300 align:middle line:84%
that I've published seven
books of channeled material,

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:84%
but what will they think
if I run around saying, oh,

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, I've been
working with Jefferson,

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Lincoln, and Eisenhower?

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.792 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: So I didn't
try terribly hard--

00:11:33.792 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't
push it, yeah.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: --to
publish these books.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, they sat on
a flash drive for 18 years.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
I began to see

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.130 align:middle line:84%
the difficulties this
country was going through

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:84%
and the compromising of so much
of what we should be honoring

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and so much of what the
presidents had told me,

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:09.860 align:middle line:84%
I went back to their messages
and knew it was time.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know, when I--

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.033 align:middle line:84%
after that, you gave
a copy to our friend.

00:12:13.033 --> 00:12:14.450 align:middle line:84%
It was sitting
on-- she brought it

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.130 align:middle line:84%
by-- it was sitting
on the coffee table,

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and I just happened
to pick it up.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.750 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, this is
Susan's friend, Gates, yeah.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And I read it, and it
was like the words--

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.060 align:middle line:90%
the only way I can put it--

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:32.230 align:middle line:84%
and I look at things on a
level of scale of refinement.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.450 align:middle line:84%
There are things with truth
and beauty and purity,

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.910 align:middle line:84%
and you just absolutely
know as you're reading them,

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.785 align:middle line:84%
this is pure, pure truth, right,
and other things that kind of

00:12:40.785 --> 00:12:42.160 align:middle line:84%
get denigrated,
and then you have

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.813 align:middle line:84%
filters and all these other
messages that come in.

00:12:44.813 --> 00:12:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes channeled works
aren't even channeled works.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.570 align:middle line:84%
You have to be careful
about channelers,

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.120 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes it's
for other reasons.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.420 align:middle line:10%
This was so clean, so pure,
and so high in the message,

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.360 align:middle line:10%
I got immediately excited,
started telling everyone

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:10%
about it, went to Amazon,
ordered a bunch of copies,

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:05.020 align:middle line:10%
started giving them away,
including here in the studio,

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.720 align:middle line:10%
because it was like
the words that we now

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.970 align:middle line:10%
need to hear as a civilization,
not just in the United States--

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:10%
this crumbling of the
world's democracies

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:20.650 align:middle line:10%
is happening everywhere, I
mean to a very sad effect.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:25.180 align:middle line:84%
It makes me deeply sad to see
how our thoughts and minds have

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.820 align:middle line:84%
been manipulated and co-opted
and our emotions have been

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:35.810 align:middle line:84%
manipulated and co-opted
through various platforms,

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:37.940 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through
television media,

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.937 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through
social media platforms,

00:13:39.937 --> 00:13:41.770 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through
flat out entertainment,

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.150 align:middle line:90%
we've been corrupted.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And we've lost the purity
of what this is all about.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.710 align:middle line:90%
And this brings back purity.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And so the book is
called "Epic Steps--

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Rekindling Democracy,
Unity, and Peace," and that

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.170 align:middle line:90%
just came to you as well.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.590 align:middle line:84%
So Gates, first of all,
thank you for this gift,

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:57.910 align:middle line:90%
because we need a template.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.623 align:middle line:84%
We need a way back, and we're
going to talk about that now.

00:14:00.623 --> 00:14:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Very good.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's go with Thomas Jefferson
and one of the quotes

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.670 align:middle line:90%
that came through that--

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.310 align:middle line:84%
we've chosen about
six for this show,

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.080 align:middle line:84%
because there are so
many beautiful things

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.980 align:middle line:90%
in these books.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.290 align:middle line:10%
So let's take a look
at this first one

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:15.970 align:middle line:10%
having to do with freedom.

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:20.440 align:middle line:10%
"Freedom run rampant leads to
the concentration of power.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.910 align:middle line:10%
Equality run rampant stifles
individual initiative.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:30.020 align:middle line:10%
But the two combined protect
us from the excesses of each."

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Again, this incredible
philosopher and clear thinker--

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.050 align:middle line:90%
talk to us about that.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: So
freedom, thinking of it

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.510 align:middle line:84%
in terms of
individual freedom, is

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.910 align:middle line:84%
one of the cornerstones
of democracy.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:49.210 align:middle line:84%
We all have, honestly,
unlimited individual freedom

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:53.300 align:middle line:84%
from one perspective,
but on the other hand,

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.010 align:middle line:84%
we only have individual
freedom in the context

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.920 align:middle line:90%
of equal opportunity.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
If individuals use their freedom
for their own best interests--

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So late.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.200 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: --at the
expense of others, then

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:14.020 align:middle line:84%
we are compromising equality
and equal opportunity.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Or if equal opportunity
becomes so predominant

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:23.110 align:middle line:84%
that it nullifies the
chance that individuals

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:26.440 align:middle line:84%
have to continue
to grow and achieve

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.190 align:middle line:84%
at their highest potential,
that doesn't work either.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the paradoxes
of democracy

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:84%
is that we're constantly
balancing two apparently

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.280 align:middle line:90%
opposite intentions.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: And yet
they're complementary.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Individual freedom, in the
context of equal opportunity--

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:52.240 align:middle line:84%
when they are in a healthy
dynamic equilibrium,

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.510 align:middle line:84%
then we have a democracy
that really works.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But if one overpowers
the other, we

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:02.360 align:middle line:84%
begin to compromise
and sacrifice

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.150 align:middle line:90%
what democracy is all about.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.042 align:middle line:90%
And that was his point.

00:16:07.042 --> 00:16:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I see
why they chose you.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Who could more articulately
reframe all this for us?

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.193 align:middle line:90%
But you know, that's true.

00:16:13.193 --> 00:16:16.030 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what we've fallen
in the midst of right now.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:17.800 align:middle line:90%
People are divided.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.530 align:middle line:84%
They want-- people who want
individual freedoms and want

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:23.720 align:middle line:84%
to prosper, regardless if it's
at the expense of others--

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.550 align:middle line:90%
and that's a fact.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.380 align:middle line:84%
That's what's
going on out there.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And then others
who want to control

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:84%
the scenario, equal the playing
field, which makes people

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.040 align:middle line:90%
feel oppressed and canceled.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.415 align:middle line:84%
That's cancel culture and all
this other stuff rising up.

00:16:35.415 --> 00:16:36.215 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Right.

00:16:36.215 --> 00:16:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These two
exact things are--

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.763 align:middle line:84%
we're watching them
play out in the world,

00:16:39.763 --> 00:16:41.680 align:middle line:84%
because no one's finding
balance between them.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Right.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm discovering-- now that
I'm really working with this

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.210 align:middle line:84%
material, I'm discovering
what a complex--

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:55.780 align:middle line:84%
what a complex experiment
self-government really is.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.580 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKIBBIN: It was
such a radical idea

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.300 align:middle line:10%
when they introduced it, when
the founding fathers decided

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.859 align:middle line:10%
to do this.

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I remember a quote that I
read from Benjamin Franklin,

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and he was asked the
question, which is better--

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:84%
which is preferable--
monarchy or a republic?

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:20.182 align:middle line:84%
And his answer was, "A
republic, if you can keep it."

00:17:20.182 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: If you can keep it.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.990 align:middle line:90%
They don't last long.

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: If you can keep it.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is the longest
lasting one in modern history,

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:90%
is it not?

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: It is,
and it's constantly

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.760 align:middle line:90%
in the process of unfolding.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:84%
We always have
the responsibility

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.740 align:middle line:84%
of perfecting how we go
about self-government.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:48.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not a thing that
happened in 1776 or 1789

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.090 align:middle line:90%
that then remained static.

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:84%
It is-- it demands
our involvement.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Conscious engagement,
which we're not doing.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: We're not doing it.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it's
always under threat.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're not
engaged consciously,

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.540 align:middle line:90%
it's always under threat--

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Yes.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --of falling to kind
of the survival of the fittest

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.110 align:middle line:84%
and whoever has the
greatest will to take.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.152 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: You're right.

00:18:11.152 --> 00:18:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that-- OK,
so and I think it's--

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:14.090 align:middle line:90%
thank you.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:84%
It's so important to get these
messages forward at this time.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.640 align:middle line:90%
And I feel the same way you do.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.440 align:middle line:84%
I have this very, very
strong will toward this,

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.730 align:middle line:90%
and I just have to share.

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:24.688 align:middle line:90%
This is a little thing.

00:18:24.688 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I hope it doesn't take our
conversation too low, OK.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So when I was in my 20s,
I was not particularly

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:84%
a history buff, but I
was absolutely obsessed

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:90%
with Jefferson.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.580 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't read enough.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.120 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't read
enough biographies.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.630 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of in love
with this man, right?

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really
understand why.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Many years later, that
little past life regression,

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.380 align:middle line:90%
and I found myself in a room.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle line:84%
He was in the room, and
it was at some gathering.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.650 align:middle line:90%
I was young.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.418 align:middle line:90%
He was a man who was already--

00:18:51.418 --> 00:18:53.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what position
he was in at the time,

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.490 align:middle line:84%
whether he was already
president, but I was, like,

00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:02.340 align:middle line:84%
a girl on the wings watching
with such intense admiration

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.880 align:middle line:84%
and respect and just
love for this person

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and watching the grace with
which this person operated

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.410 align:middle line:90%
in this room.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.570 align:middle line:84%
No one could disrespect
him in the room.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:14.500 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't even possible.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And so that was many,
many years later.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.020 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh,
maybe that's why I

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.570 align:middle line:84%
felt so drawn to
just know everything

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.640 align:middle line:90%
about his life so intimately.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And he is, I think in a lot of
people's minds still, probably,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.250 align:middle line:84%
many times, the most respected
president of the past--

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Yes.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --for
the contributions,

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.020 align:middle line:84%
in all, that he made to the
planet, which were many.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Yes.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: I've
thought a lot about what

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:46.710 align:middle line:84%
he wrote about freedom, and
I've started to consider it

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:50.850 align:middle line:84%
in the context of free
will, because so often, I

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:55.320 align:middle line:84%
think freedom can become
one of those concepts

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.720 align:middle line:84%
that we can't
quite grab hold of.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
like Janis Joplin,

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.520 align:middle line:84%
freedom's just another word
for nothing left to lose.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: Nothing
left to lose.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: OK, so-- and in
some respects, she's right.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: So what if
we thought of freedom

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:90%
in terms of free will?

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:22.200 align:middle line:84%
This planet is-- exists as
an experiment in free will.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.530 align:middle line:90%
We all have free will.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Free will-- it gives us the
opportunity to create on a day

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.940 align:middle line:90%
to day basis.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.880 align:middle line:90%
So we all live in that context.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:84%
If we think about freedom
as how we use our free will,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.490 align:middle line:84%
then freedom in a
democracy translates into,

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:53.610 align:middle line:84%
how do we make choices on
a day to day basis that

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:57.360 align:middle line:84%
create the best
possible context for us

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:03.180 align:middle line:84%
to be the most enlightened
individuals we can be

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.750 align:middle line:84%
and for our community
to come together

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:11.880 align:middle line:84%
with powerful common ground so
that we all can live together

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.740 align:middle line:90%
in peace and harmony?

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.200 align:middle line:90%
That's really what freedom is.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.075 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:21:16.075 --> 00:21:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: It's how
we use our free will

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.460 align:middle line:84%
day to day, moment to moment,
individually, and together.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if we
use it with wisdom

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.290 align:middle line:84%
and some sense of
self-responsibility,

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.240 align:middle line:84%
then you have a
beautiful experiment.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Exactly, exactly.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.398 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: And so
what I've been--

00:21:34.398 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:84%
what I've been thinking of in
the context of my own life is,

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:43.170 align:middle line:84%
what are the implications
of everything Jefferson said

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:47.190 align:middle line:84%
in establishing the
responsibilities,

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.070 align:middle line:84%
the rights we have and
the responsibilities?

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.230 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to me?

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:55.590 align:middle line:84%
I can't just take the
rights for granted

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:84%
without also acknowledging
the responsibilities I have.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And not everyone's going to
see it the same way you do,

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:06.090 align:middle line:84%
because we're all individuals
with our own filters, lenses,

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:09.690 align:middle line:84%
desires, and senses of what
anything out there means.

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So this takes us to
our next quote, right?

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.360 align:middle line:10%
"Democracy depends on
disagreement, debate,

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.470 align:middle line:10%
and recommitment.

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.230 align:middle line:10%
It enables citizens to
discover common ground

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:22.440 align:middle line:10%
despite disparate
values and viewpoints."

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've certainly seen
plenty of that in recent times

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
we now have what

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I call a bifurcation
of consciousness

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:31.470 align:middle line:84%
on the planet to such
an extreme extent,

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:36.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how we bring
these groups back together.

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: Diversity
does not necessarily

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:40.480 align:middle line:90%
lead to polarization.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what it looks
like in its healthy sense, what

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.390 align:middle line:90%
it could look like.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: In a
healthy sense, diversity

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:52.890 align:middle line:84%
is the best possible
ingredient for a democracy,

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:57.730 align:middle line:84%
because we have different
perspectives, different voices,

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:01.560 align:middle line:84%
different viewpoints
so that we can craft

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.770 align:middle line:84%
whatever would serve
all of us best,

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:08.610 align:middle line:84%
as well as what serves
us individually best.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:13.560 align:middle line:84%
If we've got only one viewpoint
or one accepted perspective

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.050 align:middle line:84%
or, God forbid, this
is my viewpoint.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:17.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm right.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:21.090 align:middle line:84%
You're wrong-- and so
much has led to that--

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:26.040 align:middle line:84%
then anything that
is different ends up

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.280 align:middle line:84%
being considered bad
or evil or unacceptable

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.440 align:middle line:84%
or something that
can't be considered,

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.560 align:middle line:84%
which then renders
diversity as a problem.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: Not only
is it not a problem.

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.120 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the great
benefits that democracy has,

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and in this country, one of the
great blessings that we have

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:53.440 align:middle line:84%
is a diversity of heritage,
of opinion, of perspective,

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and the opportunity then
is for us to come together

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:00.190 align:middle line:84%
within the context
of that diversity,

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:90%
but it requires respect.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.970 align:middle line:84%
It requires us to be
tolerant and respectful

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:08.650 align:middle line:90%
of other viewpoints.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:11.620 align:middle line:90%
It requires us to listen.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.850 align:middle line:84%
It requires us to have empathy
for other people's lifetime

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:19.900 align:middle line:84%
experiences and what they
bring to the conversation.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:24.055 align:middle line:84%
We need longer tables,
not higher walls.

00:24:24.055 --> 00:24:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We definitely do.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Longer tables.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's in that
context of dialogue,

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:36.490 align:middle line:84%
even dissension of
disagreement, only

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:84%
through respectful
disagreement can

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.000 align:middle line:84%
we come true to true
agreement, which

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.970 align:middle line:90%
then leads to true commitment.

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:50.150 align:middle line:84%
We don't have commitment, if we
don't go through this process.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.937 align:middle line:84%
This even is on-- this
starts on a family level.

00:24:53.937 --> 00:24:54.895 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Absolutely.

00:24:54.895 --> 00:24:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These principles
apply across the board.

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:02.480 align:middle line:84%
If we don't do this and practice
this within our personal lives,

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.680 align:middle line:84%
how do we think we're going to
be able to manifest anything

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.930 align:middle line:84%
healthy, once the really
big stuff comes along

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:09.170 align:middle line:90%
to society at large?

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:11.210 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing now we
weren't ready for it.

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:15.730 align:middle line:84%
We never healed what Lincoln
himself was struggling

00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:20.080 align:middle line:84%
with so deeply nearly a
couple hundred years ago now,

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.720 align:middle line:84%
and that is where we
are at this moment.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: It is where we are.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.910 align:middle line:84%
One of Lincoln's
fundamental assumptions

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:35.590 align:middle line:84%
was, I can free the slaves, but
if intolerance and disrespect

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:40.220 align:middle line:84%
and disempowerment remain,
then they are not free.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: He freed the
slaves, but the rest of it

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.930 align:middle line:90%
was not forthcoming.

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as you said,
when you connected with Lincoln

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:84%
as an entity, he had such a
compassionate heart-centered

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.240 align:middle line:84%
way of viewing
life, it probably--

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.650 align:middle line:84%
he probably didn't
fully understand

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.380 align:middle line:84%
how huge that challenge
was for people who don't

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.328 align:middle line:90%
have open hearts like that.

00:26:04.328 --> 00:26:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: He didn't-- I
don't think he understood it.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I think because his
capacity for mercy--

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: --was so vast.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:17.620 align:middle line:84%
The man-- I mean, you can
look at photographs of him

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:84%
toward the end of his
presidency and see

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:27.520 align:middle line:84%
how burdened he was by all
of the loss that occurred

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:32.710 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the war and,
at that point, his inability

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:37.030 align:middle line:84%
to really bring about
a context of mercy

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:41.710 align:middle line:84%
for the healing that is
an absolute requirement,

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:44.950 align:middle line:84%
if we are going to
come together in unity.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness leads to healing,
which then leads to unity.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:51.790 align:middle line:90%
He didn't see that.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.430 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to bring it about,
but he didn't live long enough

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:55.850 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sadly, and now
we see the repercussions

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:03.290 align:middle line:84%
of having everything cut loose
without any wisdom guiding it,

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:06.650 align:middle line:84%
without any leaders that knew
how to lead through this,

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:11.120 align:middle line:84%
and now we see, in full
color, the darkest stain

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.030 align:middle line:84%
on this country's
history, which is racism

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:84%
in full blown action, where
we've come to a time where we

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.290 align:middle line:84%
had a leader that allowed
it permissible to say

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:23.450 align:middle line:90%
your deepest, darkest thoughts.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And so it started
all coming up again.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And now here we
are, and it had to.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think that had
to happen, Gates.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:34.490 align:middle line:84%
I've never-- I have
said from the beginning,

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:36.150 align:middle line:84%
we had to go
through this period,

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.510 align:middle line:84%
so we could look at
who we really are

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:39.942 align:middle line:90%
and what we've been suppressing.

00:27:39.942 --> 00:27:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: I agree with you.

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:42.050 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:46.640 align:middle line:84%
We have a 400-year
history, fundamentally,

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.990 align:middle line:84%
of slavery, or if
not abject slavery,

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.115 align:middle line:90%
keeping people in bondage.

00:27:53.115 --> 00:27:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: 400 years.

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: And
no matter how much

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:01.010 align:middle line:84%
we pretended that we had
transcended that pattern,

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:02.400 align:middle line:90%
we didn't do it.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And so as it riled
below the surface

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and we looked the
other way, we've

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.920 align:middle line:84%
come to a point where we have
to acknowledge we never dealt

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.520 align:middle line:84%
with it effectively, we
have systemic racism,

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's time for
us to do what we

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:23.510 align:middle line:84%
can to move back into one
of Jefferson's principles,

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.410 align:middle line:90%
which is equal opportunity.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: How can we
create equal opportunity

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:34.790 align:middle line:84%
within this magnificent,
diverse culture that we have?

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.090 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to one of
Abraham Lincoln's quotes

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:40.370 align:middle line:84%
now, because we have such
gorgeous quotes here.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:43.800 align:middle line:10%
OK, it says, "I
saw the Civil War

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.010 align:middle line:10%
as the inevitable conflict of
two fundamentally different

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.650 align:middle line:10%
cultures that arose
under a single set

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.820 align:middle line:10%
of Democratic principles."

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.860 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: So the
Democratic principles

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:58.740 align:middle line:84%
were established by
the founding fathers,

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:06.340 align:middle line:84%
and they needed to have
all 13 colonies sign on.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:11.020 align:middle line:84%
They knew that the only way they
were going to get the Southern

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:15.940 align:middle line:84%
colonies to agree during the
Constitutional Convention

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:20.780 align:middle line:84%
was if they sidestepped
the issue of slavery.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And so they did, because
they wanted unity

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:26.290 align:middle line:90%
among all 13 colonies.

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:29.590 align:middle line:84%
But it was the
illusion of unity.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.350 align:middle line:90%
It was a superficial unity.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
during those four score

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and seven years ago
that Lincoln referred to

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.670 align:middle line:84%
in the Gettysburg Address,
what happened during that time

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:51.190 align:middle line:84%
was the creation of, basically,
two branches of a family

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:54.910 align:middle line:84%
tree, one branch
in the north that

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:58.660 align:middle line:84%
was based on more of a
manufacturing economy

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and that brought in
diversity, and one

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:08.620 align:middle line:84%
in the south based on slavery
and agriculture and plantation

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.760 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And the conflict between
slavery and abolition

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:19.990 align:middle line:84%
became so huge, the
Civil War had to occur,

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:24.400 align:middle line:84%
because there never was really
any unity in the first place.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:30.040 align:middle line:84%
The issue we have now is,
do we even have unity?

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.330 align:middle line:90%
Do we have unity now?

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:33.145 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Heck no.

00:30:33.145 --> 00:30:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Of course not.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:38.800 align:middle line:84%
We think, oh, we
fought the Civil War.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Everything is fine.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.050 align:middle line:84%
We came back together as the
United States of America.

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:50.565 align:middle line:84%
No, those two branches of
the family tree still exist.

00:30:50.565 --> 00:30:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's really
down to something simple.

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:56.440 align:middle line:84%
It's down to the very first
thing we talked about.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Do we turn a blind eye to gain
at the expense of another,

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.410 align:middle line:84%
or do we say that's
absolutely unacceptable--

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:06.030 align:middle line:84%
we have to find
another way, and we

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.257 align:middle line:84%
have to stand by it
through and through?

00:31:08.257 --> 00:31:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: I agree.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And we have-- we've been turning
a blind eye all this time,

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:17.310 align:middle line:84%
because so many of us
who have, let's face it,

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:23.530 align:middle line:84%
been leading a good life,
complacency begins to set in.

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, my life is going OK.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:29.120 align:middle line:90%
I have what I want.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Yes, some of these other issues
are there, but I'm too busy.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.200 align:middle line:90%
I can't be bothered.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.610 align:middle line:84%
It's time for us now
to take responsibility,

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:45.460 align:middle line:84%
for us to see what's going
on, name it, and begin

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:49.360 align:middle line:84%
to do what we can
to address the issue

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and realign who we are
together in this country.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is the big one.

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:56.050 align:middle line:90%
We're starting over.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Really, we're at a
point where we're

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.860 align:middle line:84%
kind of starting over again, if
we to be honest with ourselves,

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and we're not being
honest with ourselves.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.460 align:middle line:84%
But if we were to be, we're
starting over right now,

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and every day gives us a
chance to choose differently.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:08.960 align:middle line:90%
That's the beauty of free will.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Well, it is.

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And, I have to say, there's
a Martin Luther King

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:16.250 align:middle line:90%
quote that I really love.

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:20.670 align:middle line:84%
"It's only in the darkness
that you can see the stars."

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: We have to allow
ourselves to see the stars.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: We have to
insist those stars are there,

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and those stars
live in our heart.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And if we then tell ourselves,
yes, these issues are there.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.960 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
deny them any longer.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're capable of living
in the light, of being light,

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:53.720 align:middle line:84%
of seeing the stars, no
matter how dark it is, then

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.860 align:middle line:90%
democracy can be reborn.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: It starts with
each of us individually.

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to-- because I want to
get all these in before we're

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:03.690 align:middle line:90%
out of time.

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:04.580 align:middle line:90%
Here's another quote.

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is another quote
from Abraham Lincoln.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.950 align:middle line:10%
"There can be no democracy
without tolerance

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:11.360 align:middle line:10%
and open-mindedness.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.940 align:middle line:10%
Abolishing slavery
was the first step.

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:17.510 align:middle line:10%
Abolishing disrespect and
intolerance was the next."

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:19.520 align:middle line:10%
And this is exactly what
you just referred to.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Yes.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So those go together.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:22.045 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: Yet
it didn't happen.

00:33:22.045 --> 00:33:22.970 align:middle line:90%
It didn't happen.

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:26.600 align:middle line:84%
His whole idea
about reconstruction

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:31.310 align:middle line:84%
was to, even though there was
such division during the Civil

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:35.840 align:middle line:84%
War, to move into mercy,
and through mercy,

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.940 align:middle line:90%
could we then unite?

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Part of that mercy was
to provide education

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:45.200 align:middle line:84%
and employment opportunities
for the freed slaves,

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.150 align:middle line:90%
so they could be empowered.

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:50.930 align:middle line:84%
It was a mercy that
extended across the board,

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:53.150 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't happen.

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And we still-- it still, to
this day, does not exist.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it's
very upsetting, very

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:02.420 align:middle line:84%
upsetting to see how it's
reared its ugly head again

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:03.800 align:middle line:90%
in recent times.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.440 align:middle line:84%
But it also gives us a
chance for that healing,

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:09.800 align:middle line:84%
like you say, to look for
the stars and the opportunity

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.330 align:middle line:90%
and that healing now.

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:13.429 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's move on to
Dwight Eisenhower,

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:15.650 align:middle line:84%
because this is a whole
different kind of entity who

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:18.110 align:middle line:84%
came to warn you
right before 9/11,

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:20.639 align:middle line:84%
just like everyone knows
that famous-- in fact,

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:23.940 align:middle line:84%
we're going to look at that
YouTube video right now.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.280 align:middle line:90%
He tried to warn us.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.913 align:middle line:84%
He tried to warn us
what we could be.

00:34:26.913 --> 00:34:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So should we go ahead and look
at that little video that's

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:30.290 align:middle line:90%
now very famous--

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Sure.

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --for those
who haven't seen it.

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:32.870 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a peek.

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:35.360 align:middle line:10%
>>DWIGHT EISENHOWER: We must
guard against the acquisition

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:38.960 align:middle line:10%
of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought,

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.090 align:middle line:10%
by the military
industrial complex.

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:44.906 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:44.906 --> 00:34:50.400 align:middle line:90%


00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.699 align:middle line:10%
Every gun that is made,
every warship launched,

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:57.270 align:middle line:10%
every rocket fired signifies,
in the final sense,

00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:00.990 align:middle line:10%
a theft from those who hunger
and are not fed, those who

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:04.170 align:middle line:10%
are cold and are not clothed.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:07.740 align:middle line:10%
This world in arms is
not spending money alone.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:10.350 align:middle line:10%
It is spending the
sweat of its laborers,

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:14.790 align:middle line:10%
the genius of its scientists,
the hopes of its children.

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:17.280 align:middle line:10%
The cost of one
modern heavy bomber

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:22.110 align:middle line:10%
is this: a modern brick
school in more than 30 cities.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:26.100 align:middle line:10%
It is two electric power
plants each serving

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.010 align:middle line:10%
a town of 60,000 population.

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:33.490 align:middle line:10%
It is two fine, fully
equipped hospitals.

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:36.390 align:middle line:10%
It is some 50 miles of concrete.

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:middle line:10%
We pay for a single
fighter plane

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.130 align:middle line:10%
with our half million
bushels of wheat.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:43.710 align:middle line:10%
We pay for a single
destroyer with new homes

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:48.410 align:middle line:10%
that could have housed
more than 8,000 people.

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's painful,
because this continues today,

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and he warned us of
this 60 years ago.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.840 align:middle line:90%


00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: Before World War
II, we, the United States,

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:03.010 align:middle line:84%
had only a tiny
military presence.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And then the manufacturing
power of this country

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:15.210 align:middle line:84%
was invested in what we had
to do to help when the Civil--

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:16.800 align:middle line:90%
World War II.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And once he became
president, Eisenhower

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.180 align:middle line:84%
was faced with a
huge dilemma, which

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.900 align:middle line:84%
is the corporations
in the United States

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.007 align:middle line:84%
had grown accustomed
to massive--

00:36:30.007 --> 00:36:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Contracts.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: --contracts
from the federal government,

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and the military was
accustomed to having

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:40.240 align:middle line:90%
huge budgets and lots of power.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:45.190 align:middle line:84%
What did they do in order
to maintain both of those--

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:48.300 align:middle line:84%
the contracts and the
power in government?

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:53.850 align:middle line:84%
They had to have an enemy, and
so the enemy was right there,

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:54.650 align:middle line:90%
communist Russia.

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Oh, my goodness.

00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have to
engage in an arms race,

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.695 align:middle line:90%
and that then created--

00:37:01.695 --> 00:37:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A cold war.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: --a symbiotic
relationship between the United

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.530 align:middle line:90%
States and Russia.

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:09.430 align:middle line:90%
Eisenhower saw this.

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:10.555 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And explain that.

00:37:10.555 --> 00:37:12.910 align:middle line:84%
That's very important
to know that we needed

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:16.252 align:middle line:84%
each other to both keep those
contracts and money flowing

00:37:16.252 --> 00:37:17.710 align:middle line:84%
to the characters
running the show.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Precisely.

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower saw this
happening on his watch.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:27.430 align:middle line:84%
He argued for what he called
fitness and flexibility, which

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:31.840 align:middle line:84%
is, let's go back to
what we had before

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:36.550 align:middle line:84%
and during World War
II, which is reserves

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:40.480 align:middle line:84%
in the military, people who
are ready, if we need them,

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.127 align:middle line:84%
but we don't need a
massive standing military.

00:37:43.127 --> 00:37:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All over
the world, no less.

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: All over.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Fitness and flexibility,
as opposed to what he

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:53.003 align:middle line:90%
calls posturing and permanence.

00:37:53.003 --> 00:37:54.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And that's
what this quote is.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:57.700 align:middle line:10%
"We could have chosen the path
of fitness and flexibility,

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.760 align:middle line:10%
but posturing and
permanence prevailed.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.840 align:middle line:10%
I could not have
disagreed more."

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.512 align:middle line:10%
And this is from a military man.

00:38:04.512 --> 00:38:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Completely.

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could not
have disagreed more.

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: He
completely disagreed.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And everything in that quote,
in that video that we saw,

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.330 align:middle line:90%
it's theft.

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:14.740 align:middle line:90%
He saw the theft.

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: And this was in
the '50s he saw the theft.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.620 align:middle line:84%
We've had that theft
continuing to occur

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.590 align:middle line:90%
every year, every decade since.

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:29.020 align:middle line:84%
The money going
into the military,

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:33.340 align:middle line:84%
posturing and permanence--
they always need an enemy.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:36.650 align:middle line:90%
It always has to be enormous.

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:40.418 align:middle line:84%
I wonder, are we really the
good guys we claim to be?

00:38:40.418 --> 00:38:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, one has
to ask that question now,

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.710 align:middle line:90%
and it's a fair question.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: Yeah.

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go
to another quote,

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.540 align:middle line:84%
because I want to get to
what you're doing now,

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have that
much time left here.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.520 align:middle line:10%
"The best-- he said also,
"The best defense strategy

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.760 align:middle line:10%
is to keep the peace through
generosity and goodwill.

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.310 align:middle line:10%
Peace throughout the global
community is possible.

00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:59.510 align:middle line:10%
You must believe this."

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, we've
all lost faith in that

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:05.170 align:middle line:84%
by now, because it's been
projected on us that it's not

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:09.070 align:middle line:84%
possible by all the media, the
lobbyists, all the sellouts.

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:09.940 align:middle line:90%
And this is global.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.920 align:middle line:84%
This isn't just
the United States.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.590 align:middle line:84%
It's that silent
hand some people call

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:18.080 align:middle line:84%
the kind of elite forces behind
things that manipulate and pull

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:18.880 align:middle line:90%
strings.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:22.030 align:middle line:84%
They keep the money flowing
to specific interests.

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: But his
point is the best defense

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:31.060 align:middle line:84%
is to establish global
peace through generosity

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.350 align:middle line:90%
and goodwill.

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:36.850 align:middle line:84%
There is no more
effective avenue

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:41.260 align:middle line:84%
for the defense of the
United States or any country,

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:45.430 align:middle line:84%
but to have us create an
opportunity for all of us

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:51.820 align:middle line:84%
to live together on this planet
with goodwill in our hearts

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and generosity as
how we approach

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:55.803 align:middle line:90%
everyone and everything.

00:39:55.803 --> 00:39:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
what's so beautiful,

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.870 align:middle line:84%
it's not a New Age
guru saying this.

00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:59.870 align:middle line:90%
It's Dwight Eisenhower--

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: I know.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --a former military
general and president.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's so obvious, and
we've yet to achieve that.

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:07.690 align:middle line:90%
But you know, it starts at home.

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And Gates, for the rest
of this conversation,

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I know that you have
started up a website that

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:16.930 align:middle line:84%
helps people learn how
to re-engage, rekindle

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:20.320 align:middle line:84%
this Democratic spirit of
goodwill and generosity

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.770 align:middle line:84%
and mercy inside of ourselves,
that we start sharing

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and extending to
one another, even

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.190 align:middle line:84%
people who are different
from us and our communities.

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking
to Zeus about it,

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.490 align:middle line:84%
because I just was so charged
up after the exquisite beauty

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:35.180 align:middle line:90%
of the words in the book.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know,
we live in an area

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:40.040 align:middle line:84%
that we're kind of the odd
people out in our area.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I said,
why don't we start

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:43.450 align:middle line:90%
going to city council meetings?

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:44.800 align:middle line:90%
Let's haunt the place.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's start asking,
why are you awarding

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:49.640 align:middle line:84%
this contract for yet more
development on our farmland?

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.300 align:middle line:84%
So you know, instead of
feeling like outsiders,

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.730 align:middle line:84%
I think we all need to
start becoming insiders

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:59.350 align:middle line:84%
in our own lives, families, and
communities and extend it out.

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:01.850 align:middle line:90%
How are you approaching it?

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: I had an opportunity
to do something similar.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:12.410 align:middle line:84%
A couple weeks ago, our senator
very proudly sent an email out

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:15.920 align:middle line:84%
saying that our state
was going to become

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:20.260 align:middle line:90%
the dominant producer of hemp.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I immediately thought,
oh, my gosh, no.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Don't allow that,
because we had,

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:34.660 align:middle line:84%
the last few years, unrestricted
hemp growth in my rural area,

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.930 align:middle line:90%
hemp for the production of THC.

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
that, on farmland

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:44.140 align:middle line:84%
that used to grow
corn and soybeans,

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:50.440 align:middle line:84%
we had hemp growing right up
next to houses and schools,

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:54.490 align:middle line:84%
filling the air with oil that
was causing people to have

00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:57.100 align:middle line:90%
terrible allergic reactions.

00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:01.450 align:middle line:84%
They were getting headaches,
nausea, the worst imaginable

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:05.170 align:middle line:84%
health issues, lower
quality of life,

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:08.560 align:middle line:84%
all because there were
no restrictions placed

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.310 align:middle line:90%
on where hemp could be grown.

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:13.308 align:middle line:90%
And so I--

00:42:13.308 --> 00:42:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And by the
way, I know you-- this

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.010 align:middle line:90%
isn't a moralization.

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: No.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is not
that kind of conver--

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.660 align:middle line:84%
we don't care if someone
smokes weed or not.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: I don't care.

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's about
the fact that you guys--

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:21.970 align:middle line:90%
your eyes were swelling up.

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:22.863 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't breathe.

00:42:22.863 --> 00:42:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was really ruining
the quality of your lives.

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: For many of us--

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: --whole communities,
so I sent him an email,

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:33.430 align:middle line:84%
and I gave him very
clear feedback.

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- I was pretty
hot under the collar.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I felt so good when I
finished writing it,

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and I read through it, and the
last part was, clearly, you've

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:47.440 align:middle line:90%
been listening to growers.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.865 align:middle line:90%
Have you contacted--

00:42:48.865 --> 00:42:50.073 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Listen to citizens.

00:42:50.073 --> 00:42:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: --anyone in any
communities in our state?

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.080 align:middle line:84%
When I-- so I held
his feet to the fire.

00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:00.940 align:middle line:84%
I thought I did, at least,
and sent it out to friends.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.510 align:middle line:90%
I copied--

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:04.385 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who were also
having these effects.

00:43:04.385 --> 00:43:06.427 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: Well, then
send-- send it to friends.

00:43:06.427 --> 00:43:08.180 align:middle line:84%
They read it, and
they said, well,

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to email him, too.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell
you that there

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:17.770 align:middle line:84%
was almost an alchemy that
happened with me and with them,

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:20.470 align:middle line:90%
because we had our voice.

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:22.690 align:middle line:90%
We spoke our truth.

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:26.170 align:middle line:84%
It was from real
lived experience.

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:28.060 align:middle line:90%
He needed to hear from us.

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:29.770 align:middle line:90%
He did hear from us.

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:30.860 align:middle line:90%
We haven't heard back.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: But I
experienced how incredible

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:43.040 align:middle line:84%
it is to take my power, have
my voice, stand in my truth.

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to keep doing this.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:48.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not just about voting.

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Voting happens
every now and then.

00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:52.400 align:middle line:90%
We have to stay awake.

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.070 align:middle line:84%
We have to own our
responsibility.

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And we have to do everything
we can so that we can all

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:03.440 align:middle line:84%
live together happily, in
love, in peace, in joy,

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.490 align:middle line:90%
and good health.

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
to rebuild us

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:08.090 align:middle line:84%
into a healthier
state of existence

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:12.380 align:middle line:84%
as communities, families, and
as cultures and countries,

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.790 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take some
responsibility and some work.

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:17.510 align:middle line:84%
We can't just sit and, you
know, entertain ourselves

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:20.240 align:middle line:84%
endlessly binging
on videos, which

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.700 align:middle line:84%
is what everybody's kind of
turned to is just to drop out.

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:23.810 align:middle line:90%
It's so painful.

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:25.260 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that anymore.

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:29.030 align:middle line:84%
So this is the big girl and boy
putting on our big girl and boy

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:31.940 align:middle line:84%
under britches, as Larry
the Cable Guy would say,

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.970 align:middle line:84%
part of the conversation where
it doesn't matter what it is.

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:36.410 align:middle line:90%
Choose something.

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Choose some area of
life, and engage with it

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:44.420 align:middle line:84%
in the spirit of democracy,
of mercy, goodwill,

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.580 align:middle line:84%
and open-mindedness
toward each other.

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Just even if it's just one
relationship in our lives,

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:52.100 align:middle line:90%
I think we can lift this game.

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: We totally
can, because democracy

00:44:55.850 --> 00:45:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and self-government come down to
individual choices, the choices

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:03.860 align:middle line:90%
we make on a day-to-day basis.

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Do we make choices that
are rooted in love?

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:10.070 align:middle line:90%
Do we live from our heart?

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:12.240 align:middle line:90%
Do we speak our truth?

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Are we-- do we listen to
people with other perspectives?

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:19.910 align:middle line:10%
Are we careful not
to judge too quickly?

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:22.370 align:middle line:10%
Are we tolerant?

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Do we embrace things that
might not even appeal to us,

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:34.580 align:middle line:84%
but accept them as part of
our extraordinary opportunity

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:38.750 align:middle line:84%
to live together in this
country, on this planet,

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:42.020 align:middle line:84%
in our communities, in our
families, in our neighborhoods,

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and also create a
life that each of us

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:52.510 align:middle line:84%
individually really want to
live and can feel joyful about?

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hear, hear.

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:57.460 align:middle line:84%
I'll post a Gates McKibbin
for President sign

00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:59.430 align:middle line:90%
in my front yard.

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Gates, you're just delightful.

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:03.050 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I love
what you've done.

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:04.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad after 18
years on a hard drive,

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:06.070 align:middle line:90%
you brought this forward.

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:08.700 align:middle line:10%
So because for me, this is
one of the most important

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:09.500 align:middle line:10%
conversations.

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.320 align:middle line:10%
This has to start happening now.

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.330 align:middle line:84%
No more lip service to being
open minded and meditating

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:15.130 align:middle line:90%
and all this.

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to put our
boots to the ground.

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKIBBIN: I agree.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.782 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So again, it was
just an absolute pleasure

00:46:20.782 --> 00:46:22.990 align:middle line:84%
after all these years to
get you in the chair with me

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and offer these really
uplifting words to all of us,

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:26.902 align:middle line:90%
to humanity.

00:46:26.902 --> 00:46:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So again, thank
you for being here,

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and you're now
continuing on with this.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.730 align:middle line:90%
It's called lovehopegive.com.

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:35.350 align:middle line:84%
That's one of your
sites that shows us

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:40.360 align:middle line:84%
