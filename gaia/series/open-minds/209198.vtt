>>REGINA MEREDITH: We've entered
into an age where everyone's

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.698 align:middle line:90%
questioning everything.

00:00:11.698 --> 00:00:14.282 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first things most
of the people have questioned

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:15.150 align:middle line:90%
is their religion.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL WALLIS: We're all in this
cosmic household, where we're

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.010 align:middle line:90%
living in fear and terror.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.880 align:middle line:84%
They've deleted this
worldview where we all

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.370 align:middle line:84%
have higher cognitive
powers, and they've

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.232 align:middle line:84%
replaced it with this
feudalizing structure.

>>SEAN O'LAORIE:
But most of us are

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.330 align:middle line:84%
living cosmologies that
have been imprinted on us

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:90%
on wet cement up to age 7.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And so, we behave
in ways that we've

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:90%
been programmed to behave.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of us should
be responsible for developing

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.367 align:middle line:90%
a personal cosmology.

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:44.700 align:middle line:84%
But instead of that, there's
the fundamentalist mindset.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.640 align:middle line:90%
Shut them down.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.620 align:middle line:90%
Don't let them think.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.550 align:middle line:90%
Here's the truth.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.840 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go
to hell if you don't

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle line:90%
accept my version of truth.

>>WALLIS: These amazing
transformational experiences

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:84%
do not belong to any
particular religious

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.750 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual tradition.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.660 align:middle line:84%
They are part of the human
experience of the universe.

>>REGINA: That's why I
wanted this conversation.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.129 align:middle line:90%
This is huge.

00:01:13.235 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:84%
I have so been looking
forward to this conversation.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.000 align:middle line:10%
We're doing something
really special today

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.540 align:middle line:10%
and bringing authors Father Sean
O'Laorie and former Archdeacon

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.790 align:middle line:10%
Paul Wallace to talk
about the identity

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.360 align:middle line:10%
of the actual characters
found in the Old Testament.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.570 align:middle line:90%
Why does this matter?

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Because humanity has been
deeply programmed, to this day,

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:84%
by the words of
our ancient texts--

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.150 align:middle line:90%
guilt, shame subservience.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.460 align:middle line:84%
All of it can be
traced back ancestrally

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.780 align:middle line:90%
to our religious roots.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.030 align:middle line:84%

from Australia

the morning, Paul.

It's good to see you.

00:01:45.015 --> 00:01:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: Good day, Regina.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And welcome
again in the studio, Sean.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And you two have met a
little bit on the side

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.330 align:middle line:90%
and read each other's work.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And so, we all have a
familiar conversation,

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.940 align:middle line:84%
creating what you
call a trilogy.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>>O'LAORIE: A trialogue.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Trialogue.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.280 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:84%
So I have to say to both
of you, what really kicked

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.160 align:middle line:84%
me off initially was, in
having interviewed both of you,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:84%
the stories that were coming
up were really coming more

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:84%
from your African connections
and your days in Africa

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:90%
and African relatives.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was a story that didn't
carry this horrid weight

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.610 align:middle line:84%
that we seem to have in
the modern Western world,

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.020 align:middle line:84%
in the Abrahamic traditions,
of this guilt and shame.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.970 align:middle line:84%
It was a different
story about gods,

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.800 align:middle line:84%
so we started digging
a little deeper.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
led us here today.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.480 align:middle line:84%
So to start, I would
like to ask each of you--

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Paul, why don't you go first--

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.380 align:middle line:84%
as to why it matters
that we open up

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.950 align:middle line:84%
this can of worms
completely now today.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.490 align:middle line:10%
>>WALLIS: Well, my background
was in church-based ministry.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.890 align:middle line:10%
And part of what I did
there was teach people

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.570 align:middle line:10%
to interpret ancient texts.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.260 align:middle line:84%
It's called hermeneutics,
and in particular, the Bible.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.200 align:middle line:10%
And the tools that
we developed in that,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.510 align:middle line:10%
which are source
analysis, where you ask,

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.210 align:middle line:10%
where does this text come from?

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.310 align:middle line:84%
How is it different
from the original?

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And form analysis-- what
kind of literature is this.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And then along with,
what do the words mean?

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.600 align:middle line:84%
They were the tools
that I use to study

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.580 align:middle line:84%
the books of
scripture, the tools

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:84%
that every preacher
and scholar uses.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.390 align:middle line:84%
But I found when I applied them
to anomalies in the stories we

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.850 align:middle line:84%
tell from the Bible,
they were leading me

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:84%
in an unfamiliar direction, and
they opened up this whole story

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.120 align:middle line:90%
of paleo contact.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Hidden in plain
sight in the Bible

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.410 align:middle line:84%
is this story of
ancient ET contact.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was from that my
first book on the subject

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.570 align:middle line:90%
emerged, "Escaping from Eden."

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was preparing to publish
that, weighing up in my mind

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.360 align:middle line:84%
what this was going to mean for
me to put out something that

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:84%
was really quite controversial
from a faith background,

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.750 align:middle line:84%
that I suddenly remembered I
had to tell my parents-in-law

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.190 align:middle line:90%
about this book.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And they are traditional
Christian believers.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.700 align:middle line:84%
They are of Pentecostal
and Baptist background.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, how do I
break the news to them

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.550 align:middle line:84%
that I think a lot of the
Bible is about ET contact?

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Because I really do want
to stay their son-in-law.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.120 align:middle line:84%
So I just had to wait until
they'd come and visited

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.320 align:middle line:84%
for the weekend, and
everyone was relaxed.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And we had some lovely Ghanaian
food and some lovely wine.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Once everyone was
relaxed, I gently

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
told them what my
new book was about.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:90%
And they sat there, poker faces.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea how this
information was going down.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I finally paused for
breath, my father-in-law, Kofi,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.640 align:middle line:84%
leant back in his chair,
and he said, Paul,

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.770 align:middle line:90%
a penny has dropped.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, that all
those anomalies

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:84%
in the stories we
tell from the Bible

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.120 align:middle line:84%
were beginning to resolve,
and click into place,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:90%
and make sense to him.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And then my
mother-in-law, Patience,

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:84%
leant forward and said, Paul,
we already know this story.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Because in Ghana, you're
taught the Christian Orthodox

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:90%
view in church.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:84%
You're taught the modern
scientific view in school.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.910 align:middle line:84%
But the local knowledge,
the local folklore, we

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.010 align:middle line:84%
have always known that there
has been a non-human element

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:84%
to human history, a non-human
presence on planet Earth

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:84%
intersecting with
the human story,

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and we're very connected
with another family who've

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.350 align:middle line:90%
had direct experience of this.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.480 align:middle line:90%
And so, that blew my mind.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea I was that close
to the experience of the things

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.480 align:middle line:90%
I'd been writing about.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was that conversation
that took me on a journey

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.200 align:middle line:84%
all around Africa and
all around the world,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:84%
sitting at the feet
of Indigenous leaders

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:84%
and hearing the
same story of paleo

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.110 align:middle line:90%
contact and human potential.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
beginning of my journey.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
you mentioned it.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.467 align:middle line:84%
And it's important
just for anyone

00:05:53.467 --> 00:05:57.130 align:middle line:84%
who's saying, where did
his Baptist in-laws live

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.930 align:middle line:90%
at the time?

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.222 align:middle line:90%
And you're talking about Ghana.

00:05:59.222 --> 00:06:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
a family from Ghana.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So we understand they
had their own Indigenous

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:84%
roots of spirituality
that you're speaking of.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.755 align:middle line:90%
So just to place everything.

00:06:07.755 --> 00:06:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: That's exactly right.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: To clarify
that, so in Ghana,

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:84%
they had a sort of
dual layer of story.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.090 align:middle line:84%
There was all the
official story that

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.420 align:middle line:84%
came when the British
arrived in 1874

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.380 align:middle line:84%
and took over the news agencies,
the newspapers, education.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:84%
But the local
folklore, you're right,

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.280 align:middle line:84%
was the Ghanaian,
Indigenous Ghanaian story.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Paul.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Sean, you're Irish Catholic
with interesting background,

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:34.890 align:middle line:90%
as our viewers know.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.098 align:middle line:90%
>>O'LAORIE: Thanks a million.

00:06:36.098 --> 00:06:38.970 align:middle line:10%
So I was raised
by my grandparents

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:10%
for the first six years of
my life, my father's parents.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.702 align:middle line:84%
And my great grandmother was
still alive at that stage.

00:06:44.702 --> 00:06:47.160 align:middle line:84%
She had a very difficult name,
and I couldn't pronounce it.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:90%
I used to call her Muddy.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:10%
And Muddy was like
a Christian mystic.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.310 align:middle line:90%
She was this rotunda.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.882 align:middle line:90%
She was high.

00:06:54.882 --> 00:06:56.340 align:middle line:84%
She was an
extraordinary character,

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.570 align:middle line:90%
and she was really mystical.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And she had this extraordinary
devotion, particularly,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:90%
to mother Mary.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.570 align:middle line:84%
She would talk to Mary
aloud, and I was privy

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:04.750 align:middle line:90%
to these conversations.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.220 align:middle line:90%
So I presume this was normal.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So I was inculcated with this
level of Christian mysticism.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And she had these
stories, and I could never

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.460 align:middle line:84%
figure out where she got them,
particularly birth stories

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.570 align:middle line:90%
about Jesus.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And I subsequently saw
Irish interpretations

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.450 align:middle line:84%
of the Gnostic scriptures done
in the fifth and sixth century

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.528 align:middle line:84%
that I never heard about
in eight years in seminary.

00:07:30.528 --> 00:07:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And she was telling
me these stories.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering,
where in God's name

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.850 align:middle line:90%
do these stories come from?

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's one group
of stories that we're

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.220 align:middle line:84%
hearing from the
great grandparents,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and there's another group
we're hearing from the church.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.628 align:middle line:84%
And they never met
together until I started

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:90%
reading the Gnostic scriptures.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.490 align:middle line:84%
I said, Holy God, Almighty,
Muddy was there 40 years

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:84%
before me, and she never even
went to grade school, let alone

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.080 align:middle line:90%
high school, or seminary.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
first piece of it.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And at age 6, I'm given
back to my parents.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And my parents are living
with my mother's parents,

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.310 align:middle line:84%
my grandfather, whom
I call Daddy Jim.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:90%
And he was literally a druid.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.240 align:middle line:84%
He was a great Irish tap
dancer, great musician.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And he was the best storyteller
I've ever heard in my life.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And he filled my head with
all these great stories

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:90%
about the [GAELIC].

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.800 align:middle line:84%
In Gaelic, we call them the
[GAELIC],, the fairy horse.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And he told me stories about
being abducted himself and time

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.060 align:middle line:84%
lapses, as a little
boy, seven years old,

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.567 align:middle line:84%
missing three days
out of his life.

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:84%
So I got filled up
with these stories.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.480 align:middle line:84%
So now, I go to the
seminary at age 18.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I spent eight years
in the seminary.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.343 align:middle line:84%
I'm let loose on
Africa at age 26.

00:08:34.343 --> 00:08:35.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
out there, and I'm

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.130 align:middle line:84%
going to tell these
people about the God

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:39.360 align:middle line:90%
I learned in the seminary.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And I very, very
quickly realized,

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.200 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'm
meeting a people who

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.483 align:middle line:84%
are not as religious, but
perhaps much more spiritual.

00:08:46.483 --> 00:08:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Because it didn't
have to do with Sunday

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.670 align:middle line:84%
worship or not eating
meat on a Friday,

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't have to
do with indulgences.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And there was no mention
of heaven or hell anywhere.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to
realize that I needed

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.200 align:middle line:84%
to become what Carl Jung would
call a Gnostic intermediary,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.320 align:middle line:84%
somebody who is all fair
with two different systems

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and can cross fertilize them
to their mutual benefit.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And so my job was, you
tell me your stories,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.867 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you my stories.

00:09:10.867 --> 00:09:12.450 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you Celtic
stories, and I'll

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.617 align:middle line:90%
tell you a Catholic stories.

00:09:13.617 --> 00:09:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And you tell me
Kalenjin stories,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.070 align:middle line:90%
and we began to trade stories.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And so, I began to see that
friends that the names that I

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.590 align:middle line:84%
had for God or even
the greetings they had,

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.070 align:middle line:84%
in the Kalenjin languages,
there were nomadic pastoralists

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.450 align:middle line:90%
that I lived with.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.600 align:middle line:84%
They were being forcibly settled
into an agricultural lifestyle

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.520 align:middle line:90%
after independence in 1963.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.250 align:middle line:90%
And I went there in 1972.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So most of these people
were like first generation

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.420 align:middle line:90%
agriculturalists.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.020 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know much about it.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And so, I'm listening to them
until their names for God,

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.100 align:middle line:84%
and there's this
greeting ritual.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.132 align:middle line:84%
We lived in very,
very tiny communities.

00:09:50.132 --> 00:09:52.590 align:middle line:84%
You didn't meet people that
often because they're wandering

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.757 align:middle line:90%
around with their livestock.

00:09:53.757 --> 00:09:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And when they met each other,
there was this entire ritual.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And instead of saying to
somebody, hi, how you doing?

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.950 align:middle line:90%
The greeting was, [NON-ENGLISH].

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And [NON-ENGLISH] literally
means, do you love yourself?

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.930 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is [NON-ENGLISH].

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And then the next question
was, [NON-ENGLISH]??

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.180 align:middle line:90%
Does your wife love herself?

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.830 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH] Yes, my
wife loves herself.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.020 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH] Do your
children love themselves?

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH] And then the
clincher was, [NON-ENGLISH]??

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.630 align:middle line:90%
Do your cattle love themselves?

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.930 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH] My
cattle love themselves.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:27.480 align:middle line:84%
So these are people
who are totally

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.110 align:middle line:90%
aligned with themselves.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is what their
God does for them.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.390 align:middle line:84%
They're totally aligned
with their lifestyle.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And the way to greet
somebody is to make sure

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:37.780 align:middle line:84%
that the other person
is in alignment as well.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.808 align:middle line:84%
So it's a totally different
notion of greeting.

00:10:40.808 --> 00:10:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It almost
brings tears to my eyes

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.990 align:middle line:84%
to think that loving oneself
is even part of a dialogue.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.090 align:middle line:84%
You won't hear that
happening, well,

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.580 align:middle line:84%
in Boulder or
anywhere else, really.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.670 align:middle line:84%
So let me ask then,
when both of you--

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:58.500 align:middle line:84%
now, your work is in
Australia, Paul, right?

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:90%
And so you have--

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.007 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the
congregation at the time--

00:11:03.007 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
because you were
between congregations

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.380 align:middle line:84%
which allowed you to start
taking this message forward.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.080 align:middle line:84%
But you're in
Africa at this time.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.950 align:middle line:90%
Did the shame and guilt stick?

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>O'LAORIE: On my part?

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To the people learning
about the Old Testament gods.

00:11:19.555 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>O'LAORIE: I've
never met any people--

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.192 align:middle line:84%
I've never met an African
with poor self-esteem.

00:11:24.192 --> 00:11:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what's driving me.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.850 align:middle line:84%
That's why I wanted
this conversation.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.490 align:middle line:90%
This is huge.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>O'LAORIE: Unless they
were educated by Europeans.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.405 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:11:33.405 --> 00:11:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Paul, what was your
version of that?

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Because you had to take
these uncomfortable parts

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:43.908 align:middle line:84%
of the Bible with these cruel
aspects of a god some kind.

00:11:43.908 --> 00:11:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Well,
that's exactly right.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think anyone who
has a faith like mine was,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.440 align:middle line:84%
which was centered on
Jesus, has problems

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.110 align:middle line:84%
with the way the God
character appears

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:58.200 align:middle line:90%
to behave in the Old Testament.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.370 align:middle line:84%
For me, the reason for that
is that we are reading stories

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle line:84%
in the Old Testament,
some of which

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.270 align:middle line:90%
are about other kinds of entity.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.820 align:middle line:84%
They're not God
stories originally.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.010 align:middle line:90%
They're stories of colonization.

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.980 align:middle line:84%
They're stories of
violence and brutalisation

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.890 align:middle line:84%
by other species who were
here at different times.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:84%
When we read those as Gods
stories, you end up with a God

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.240 align:middle line:84%
that you have to tiptoe around
for fear of offending him.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.800 align:middle line:84%
You might offend
him by accident.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, your
family is punished

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.400 align:middle line:90%
to the seventh generation.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.100 align:middle line:90%
He's mercurial, unforgiving.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, origin, one of
the church fathers

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.880 align:middle line:84%
said, if you read
the Old Testament

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.820 align:middle line:84%
stories of the
Elohim that way, you

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.190 align:middle line:84%
will have to believe
of God things

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.460 align:middle line:84%
you would not believe of the
most savage and unjust of men.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: And it's a
little bit like what

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.850 align:middle line:84%
happens to the self-esteem of a
child in a home, where there's

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:55.080 align:middle line:84%
a parent who has mental health
problems or substance abuse

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle line:90%
issues, addiction issues.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has to tiptoe around
that potentially dangerous

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.740 align:middle line:84%
parent, and their self
esteem goes to nothing.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think we've done that
to ourselves by portraying

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.050 align:middle line:90%
an almighty God in that way.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:13.230 align:middle line:84%
We're all in this cosmic
household where we're

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.510 align:middle line:90%
living in fear and terror.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:19.290 align:middle line:84%
But I think, also, the African
experience is so different.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.350 align:middle line:84%
So the British go into
Ghana, and they go in

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:84%
with that distorted story about
God that is all about taking

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.890 align:middle line:84%
away our self-esteem,
turning us into nobodies,

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.550 align:middle line:84%
whose only virtue is
to serve the superior.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.698 align:middle line:84%
But there is a local story
that's far more empowering,

00:13:38.698 --> 00:13:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and I found this the
pattern all around the world

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.940 align:middle line:84%
that the local, the ancestral
story is far more empowering.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:84%
If I go to a traditional
healer in Africa,

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.600 align:middle line:84%
whether it's West Africa
or Southern Africa,

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.200 align:middle line:84%
that traditional healer will
perceive me entering the room

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.960 align:middle line:90%
with an invisible support team.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, the
shamanic healer

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.370 align:middle line:84%
will be a little
agnostic as to who

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.530 align:middle line:84%
or what the support
team are, but they'll

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:08.070 align:middle line:84%
be listening for communication
because they believe

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.870 align:middle line:84%
each one of us has a
support team that's

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:15.030 align:middle line:84%
there to help us in our progress
through life and in our journey

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.590 align:middle line:90%
of health.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:18.510 align:middle line:84%
You think about the
worldview difference

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:24.450 align:middle line:84%
that creates, that you and I
are so important in the cosmos,

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:28.290 align:middle line:84%
that we would each have a
support team to get us through.

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:84%
With that world view,
you're never alone.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.510 align:middle line:84%
You've got a universe
of resources.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.470 align:middle line:90%
That's how important you are.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.620 align:middle line:84%
How can you have
lower self esteem

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.850 align:middle line:84%
when you're that
important to the universe?

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's a totally
different start point.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.850 align:middle line:84%
So it really reinforces
what Sean was just

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.850 align:middle line:84%
saying why he never
found that low self

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.000 align:middle line:84%
esteem and his journeys
through Africa.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.890 align:middle line:84%
When I was in
theological college,

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:84%
we had some African
students training with us.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.890 align:middle line:84%
They were from Nigeria, and we
were having a conversation one

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:01.550 align:middle line:84%
day about the problem
of youth suicide, which

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:06.290 align:middle line:84%
is the leading cause of death
for under 25-year-old males.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the case
in the USA and the UK.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And we had to explain
what suicide meant

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.860 align:middle line:90%
to our Nigerian friends.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.470 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't get their
heads around the idea someone

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.080 align:middle line:84%
would deliberately
kill themselves,

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.080 align:middle line:84%
that they would feel that
badly about themselves.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.980 align:middle line:84%
It was a totally
foreign concept.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think
the world view we

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.280 align:middle line:84%
get to, by the distortions
of our God stories,

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.330 align:middle line:84%
and the worldview we get to from
the African shamanic stories

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.810 align:middle line:84%
are totally different
experiences of life.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And Sean, as you said in
a previous conversation,

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.620 align:middle line:84%
there isn't even a word
for low self-esteem.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>O'LAORIE: There's not.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And there's a word in
Swahili called fundi.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.480 align:middle line:90%
Fundi literally means an expert.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And everybody called
himself a fundi.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So you think a fundi would
be like a brain surgeon,

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:90%
or a scientist, or whatever.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.060 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.018 align:middle line:84%
If you're a plumber, you
call yourself a fundi.

00:16:06.018 --> 00:16:07.880 align:middle line:84%
If you're a carpenter,
you are a fundi.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.990 align:middle line:84%
I was in a mission at one
stage, a big, big mission.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And away in the bush
called [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Huge, huge, big parish.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Some of my out stations were
literally hundreds miles

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.370 align:middle line:90%
traveling.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And I had this old Volkswagen
Beetle that I traveled around.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.410 align:middle line:90%
It's all dirt roads.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:24.952 align:middle line:84%
And when you travel
in these, there's

00:16:24.952 --> 00:16:27.940 align:middle line:84%
a plume of red dirt
behind you, modern dirt.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.320 align:middle line:90%
And so, I always got filthy.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So I went at the
mission, and I'm

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:90%
trying to wash down this car.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And a guy comes by, big,
big, strong guy called Paolo.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And Paolo, I said, talking,
Paolo, what do you do?

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm a fundi.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.870 align:middle line:84%
I said, what are
you an expert in?

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:90%
I was washing my car.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm an expert on washing cars.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:47.740 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:90%
Have a go.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.720 align:middle line:90%
So I give him the hose.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm hosing down the car, and
the inside is filthy as well.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And I go into the
intermission for half an hour.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.480 align:middle line:90%
I come back out.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.400 align:middle line:84%
He's hosing down the
inside of the car

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.340 align:middle line:84%
with this big, big
little lick of fire hose.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And in the Volkswagen, the
battery is under the back seat.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:84%
So the water is getting
down to the battery.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:06.970 align:middle line:90%
It's spilling the acid.

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.660 align:middle line:84%
The whole backside
fell out of the car.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.910 align:middle line:90%
Two weeks later, he comes back.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.598 align:middle line:84%
Paolo, what are you
doing back here?

00:17:14.598 --> 00:17:16.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, you've ruined
my car two weeks ago.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.973 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah, that
was two weeks ago.

00:17:17.973 --> 00:17:18.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm a fundi now.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.359 align:middle line:84%
I'll wash your
car again for you.

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:23.109 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it
would be lovely to have

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:26.110 align:middle line:84%
that kind of self-esteem,
credentialed or not, right?

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:28.750 align:middle line:90%


00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:32.650 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that
strikes me about this is,

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.420 align:middle line:90%
now, we've entered into an age--

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and that's why Gaia
exists is because we've

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.500 align:middle line:84%
entered into an age
where everyone's

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.580 align:middle line:90%
questioning everything.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.705 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first things
most of the people that

00:17:41.705 --> 00:17:45.040 align:middle line:84%
watch this show and others have
questioned is their religion.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And you two both
had the challenge

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:50.890 align:middle line:84%
of having to speak of these
uncomfortable brutal passages

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.050 align:middle line:84%
to congregations at
one time or another.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And I know that it gave you very
conflicted feelings to do so.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.680 align:middle line:84%
So now we look at what's
happened as people

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.800 align:middle line:90%
have turned away from religion.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're
looking at the effects

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:84%
of a mass type of atheism,
scientific materialism spilling

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.770 align:middle line:90%
over into atheism.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.360 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty much
running the show.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.390 align:middle line:84%
We know religion is on the
decline in the Western world.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Not quite as much as
in the US, but way down

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.370 align:middle line:84%
in England and many
other countries.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.930 align:middle line:90%
So let's speak about this.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:26.170 align:middle line:84%
What happens then when
you no longer want

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.830 align:middle line:84%
to buy the story of the
angry and brutal gods,

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:84%
and you no longer choose
to be subservient to this,

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.100 align:middle line:84%
regardless of whether you're
Muslim, whether you're Jewish,

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.020 align:middle line:84%
or whether you're
Christian, doesn't matter.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.790 align:middle line:90%
It's happening all over.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>O'LAORIE: So
here's what I see.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:84%
When I look at the trajectory
of mainstream religions

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.990 align:middle line:84%
across the world, you
start off with some kind

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.690 align:middle line:84%
of a charismatic prophet,
a Buddha figure, or a Jesus

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
figure, or whatever,
who is really--

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.260 align:middle line:90%
people are attracted to him.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a
bunch of followers.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, the prophet is either
killed or dies naturally.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, the followers
create a community.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And then, the community somehow
has self-appointed oligarchy

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.690 align:middle line:84%
comes to the top
of the community.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I know they insist on
some form of orthodoxy.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, the orthodoxy
spills into inquisitions

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.752 align:middle line:84%
against their own, who don't
believe what they believe,

00:19:14.752 --> 00:19:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and then into crusades
against the others.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, at some stage,
there's a new prophet comes.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:20.777 align:middle line:84%
And Paul, you mentioned two
of them very beautifully

00:19:20.777 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:90%
in your latest book.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Francis and Dominic
in the 1200s,

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.880 align:middle line:84%
looking at the trajectory
of Christianity

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:32.110 align:middle line:84%
that went from the carpenter
of Galilee to the Crusades

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:90%
in the 11th and 12th centuries.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And so, you get this
cycle happening again.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a kind
of a fractal of what

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.410 align:middle line:84%
you see happening
with the evolution

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.860 align:middle line:84%
from polytheism
through polytheism,

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:48.070 align:middle line:84%
a system in which there are
many, many ways in which you

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:50.680 align:middle line:84%
can relate to that, which
you do not understand.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And polytheistic culture
has to be much more

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:54.593 align:middle line:90%
forgiving of each other.

00:19:54.593 --> 00:19:56.260 align:middle line:84%
But when you develop
monotheism, there's

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.440 align:middle line:84%
only one way, one orthodoxy,
one truth, one God, and then

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.560 align:middle line:90%
you can punish people.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.730 align:middle line:84%
So polytheistic systems have
a much better record at being

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:07.600 align:middle line:84%
allowing others to think
what they need to think.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.150 align:middle line:84%
So you get the trajectory
from monotheism.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:12.370 align:middle line:90%
The second stage was monolatry.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:14.595 align:middle line:84%
Monolatry is where
there are many gods.

00:20:14.595 --> 00:20:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And you know there
are many gods,

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:18.490 align:middle line:84%
but you are choosing to
follow a particular one.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And it has a great phrase
that repeats again and again

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:22.750 align:middle line:90%
in the Hebrew scriptures--

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.272 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:20:25.272 --> 00:20:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Who is like you among
the gods, oh, Lord?

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So even Moses, if
he ever existed,

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.000 align:middle line:84%
was not a monotheist by any
stretch of the imagination.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.210 align:middle line:84%
He was an advocate
of a particular god.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.530 align:middle line:84%
But this god, as far as I'm
concerned, was just a sky

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:37.330 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And then, you go
from monotheism,

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:43.330 align:middle line:84%
which only came into Judaism
during the Babylonian captivity

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:47.710 align:middle line:84%
between 597 BC and 539 BC
when they were in Babylon.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the infant
circumcision, table fellowship,

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.027 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of covenant,
the idea of Sabbath, rest,

00:20:55.027 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:90%
the idea table fellowship.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:84%
They are setting
themselves aside

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.291 align:middle line:84%
because the 10 other
tribes have been wiped out

00:21:01.291 --> 00:21:03.500 align:middle line:90%
in 721 by the Assyrian Empire.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.750 align:middle line:90%
There's only two tribes left--

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.542 align:middle line:84%
Judah and Benjamin,
and they're desperately

00:21:06.542 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:84%
needed to hold on
to their identity.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is when the
priestly version of the Bible

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.810 align:middle line:84%
comes out, the priestly
section of the Bible,

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.750 align:middle line:84%
insisting on genealogies,
and history, and counts,

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.490 align:middle line:90%
and ritual, and stuff like that.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.703 align:middle line:84%
Now, the older systems,
they're basically

00:21:20.703 --> 00:21:22.120 align:middle line:84%
just following
different, I think,

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial communities
and thinking they're gods.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Like the cargo cults in the
Polynesian Islands during World

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.840 align:middle line:84%
War II, where American
and Japanese airmen

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.450 align:middle line:84%
were coming down and
giving gifts to the locals

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.130 align:middle line:90%
and using it as bases.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And when the war was
over and they left,

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.590 align:middle line:84%
these guys thought
there were gods.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And they started
creating rituals

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.660 align:middle line:90%
to seduce them back again.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And they're known
as cargo cults.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:46.330 align:middle line:90%
In some senses--

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cargo cults.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>O'LAORIE: Cargo cults.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
you're saying God,

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.470 align:middle line:84%
you have this cute
little accent.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:51.580 align:middle line:90%
It sounds like guides.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.380 align:middle line:84%
In our communities and the
guides, and you're saying gods.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.263 align:middle line:90%
>>O'LAORIE: OK, all right.

00:21:56.263 --> 00:21:59.570 align:middle line:84%
What they called gods were just
technologically-advanced sky

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:00.370 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>O'LAORIE: And they
didn't know any better.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And so, they thought
they were gods.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And they started
imitating two things.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.780 align:middle line:84%
You start imitating where
they live and how they behave.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So we get our moral
codes from the gods,

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.130 align:middle line:90%
and we get our temples.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.293 align:middle line:84%
So if you build these
temples, they'll come down

00:22:14.293 --> 00:22:15.460 align:middle line:90%
and they'll live here again.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.043 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the
temple in Jerusalem.

00:22:17.043 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:84%
You've got the sanctuary lamp
in Catholic churches, where

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.040 align:middle line:84%
a host is reserved and the
belief system that, after mass,

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.990 align:middle line:84%
when the priest consecrate
host and he puts

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.022 align:middle line:84%
some back into the
Tabernacle, Jesus

00:22:28.022 --> 00:22:29.230 align:middle line:90%
is delivering the Tabernacle.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's like you trapped Jesus
into a physical location.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And so, we trapped
him in hosts, and we

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:36.250 align:middle line:84%
trapped him in our
ethical systems,

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:90%
repeated what we saw them doing.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.820 align:middle line:90%
And they were deadly.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.390 align:middle line:84%
So we imitated the
good, and the bad,

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:42.910 align:middle line:90%
and the ugly in these guys.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that gets much
later in the conversation

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.050 align:middle line:84%
into the shadow of
ourselves and much

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:84%
of what is created in the
Old Testament in particular.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:90%
Paul.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:10%
>>WALLIS: Well, firstly,
everything that Sean just

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.770 align:middle line:10%
said he's said so beautifully.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, I'm
finding that I'm

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.410 align:middle line:84%
contacted every
week by people who

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:06.070 align:middle line:84%
are part of this exodus that
you're describing, Regina.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:10.570 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people tell me
that through their background

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:14.350 align:middle line:84%
in faith, or religion,
or church life,

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:19.630 align:middle line:84%
they've had amazing positive
transformational experiences.

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to get
their heads around how

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:84%
that fits with the negative
control fear-based manipulation

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.790 align:middle line:84%
that they've seen very
often in group life

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.230 align:middle line:90%
or in institutional life.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:84%
All around the world,
we're discovering

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:38.570 align:middle line:84%
what our religious institutions
have been doing and enabling

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:84%
around the world, and
it's deeply shocking.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: And I think
that's a big part

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.890 align:middle line:84%
of why people are moving away
from institutional religion.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And I find it really exciting
to be talking with people

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:84%
who are able to separate
these experiences they've

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:59.830 align:middle line:84%
had from these negative
behaviors in groups

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.990 align:middle line:84%
that they've witnessed
and to realize

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:06.295 align:middle line:84%
that the manipulation is
not a representation of God,

00:24:06.295 --> 00:24:07.420 align:middle line:90%
the source of the universe.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>>O'LAORIE: Exactly.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Or that
fear-based religion

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.190 align:middle line:84%
is not really
representative of God,

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:13.550 align:middle line:90%
the source of the universe.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a distortion.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
hold on to what's

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.560 align:middle line:84%
been real if they've experienced
an emotional healing,

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:25.450 align:middle line:84%
or a physical healing,
or a rebirth experience

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:26.750 align:middle line:90%
in their life.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that I find

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:30.970 align:middle line:84%
helps me have
those conversations

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:35.830 align:middle line:84%
is to realize that these amazing
transformational experiences do

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:39.580 align:middle line:84%
not belong to any
particular religious

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.990 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual tradition.

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: They are part
of the human experience

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:46.070 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And so, all the things that
in my youth, I used to think,

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.930 align:middle line:84%
well, only Christians
have this, I've discovered

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:54.860 align:middle line:90%
that the human race has this.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I used to think only Christians
could do healing like this

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.820 align:middle line:84%
or tap cosmic
information this way.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered, no,
mystical traditions,

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:06.010 align:middle line:84%
shamanic traditions,
people of no spirituality

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.600 align:middle line:84%
have these experiences
all the time.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And making that shift has
been very positive for me

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:15.850 align:middle line:84%
because it's enabled me to
form a relationship of love

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:21.160 align:middle line:84%
and respect with all people and
not have this sub-agenda of,

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.310 align:middle line:84%
yes, but I'm really right,
and you're really wrong.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.990 align:middle line:84%
You really need to
join what I'm doing.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Once you've dismantled
that, your relationships

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:31.660 align:middle line:84%
shift and take you
to a point where

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:35.410 align:middle line:84%
you are hungry for the good
and the transformational,

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.690 align:middle line:84%
and you're very
willing to walk away

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:41.830 align:middle line:84%
from all those tools of
manipulation and fear-mongering

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and control that
have unfortunately

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.120 align:middle line:90%
marked institutional religion.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very well said, and
that is the ideal condition,

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:55.960 align:middle line:84%
where we retain what was
magical and a type of belief

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.810 align:middle line:84%
in something even
beyond ourselves

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:02.860 align:middle line:84%
while letting go of the parts
that have been damaging.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.290 align:middle line:84%
What I'm referring to,
also, are the people

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.210 align:middle line:84%
who haven't been able
to do that, which

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:10.270 align:middle line:84%
is a very large percentage
of the population, who simply

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:13.600 align:middle line:84%
are saying, no, I
reject that completely.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Where do both of you feel that
takes us, if you haven't yet

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.530 align:middle line:84%
embraced this deeper
spirit inside yourself

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and our capability as
magnificent human beings,

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.080 align:middle line:90%
for healing and everything else?

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.630 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't
taken that next step

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and you just have been left
with the rejection of it

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:36.730 align:middle line:84%
into scientific materialism,
consumerism, agnosticism,

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:38.650 align:middle line:84%
atheism, and whatnot,
what does that

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:84%
do to us, as a
species, if you want

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.348 align:middle line:84%
to give us your versions of
a snapshot of us right now.

00:26:44.348 --> 00:26:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>O'LAORIE: It puts us
back to sleep immediately.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:49.570 align:middle line:10%
Because I believe that the
evolution from monotheism

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:54.430 align:middle line:10%
to monolatry to the two-system
God under Zoroastrianism.

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:57.730 align:middle line:84%
You had an Angra Mainyu and
Ahura Mazda, the god of light

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:58.780 align:middle line:90%
and the god of darkness.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And then Judaism would
collapse that to monotheism.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, a pharaoh
called Akhenaten

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:06.370 align:middle line:90%
had gotten there about 1,400.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to ask
you about him in just a minute.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.865 align:middle line:84%
>>O'LAORIE: Yeah, he had created
the first monotheistic system.

00:27:10.865 --> 00:27:12.820 align:middle line:84%
But it was proved
to be the priests

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.110 align:middle line:90%
were really upset with him.

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So all the evidence was
destroyed subsequently.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.370 align:middle line:84%
So there were movements
to monotheism,

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:20.500 align:middle line:84%
but monotheism is
only a way station

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.780 align:middle line:90%
on the road to mysticism.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.663 align:middle line:84%
>>O'LAORIE: But instead
of going toward mysticism,

00:27:24.663 --> 00:27:26.140 align:middle line:90%
we went to sectarian warfare.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And there are now 4,300
different religions

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.140 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth right now.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And so what's happened is this
extraordinary fragmentation,

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and it's a
fragmentation occasioned

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:41.410 align:middle line:84%
by institutionalization of the
individual journey to source.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of us should
be responsible for developing

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.550 align:middle line:90%
a personal cosmology.

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:47.170 align:middle line:84%
All the great
teachers tell us that.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Gautama Siddhartha
would say, I am Buddha.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.100 align:middle line:90%
I am awake.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Socrates would say,
the unexamined life

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:54.190 align:middle line:90%
is not worth living.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Jesus would say, if
the householder knew

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.690 align:middle line:84%
when the thief was going
to break in and steal,

00:27:58.690 --> 00:27:59.830 align:middle line:90%
he wouldn't go to sleep.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.420 align:middle line:90%
So it's all about waking up.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:04.060 align:middle line:84%
But most of us are
living cosmologies

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:08.350 align:middle line:84%
that have been imprinted on us
on wet cement up to age seven.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And so we behave
in ways that we've

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:11.950 align:middle line:84%
been programmed to
behave, and we're not

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:13.280 align:middle line:90%
thinking for ourselves.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.520 align:middle line:84%
So in any situation,
we find ourselves,

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:19.180 align:middle line:84%
we're going to respond from
an unconsciously acquired

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and an unconsciously
accessed personal cosmology.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:23.980 align:middle line:84%
So I keep telling
my community again,

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.320 align:middle line:84%
and again, and again,
your primary duty

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:84%
is to create a
personal cosmology.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And it should do
four things for you.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.670 align:middle line:84%
It should strength you, but it
should make your heart sing.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:36.400 align:middle line:84%
It should be able to accommodate
all your own unique experiences

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.770 align:middle line:84%
of life, and you have to
keep upgrading it again,

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and again, and again,
from day to day.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Because you're a
unique human being.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's like when you
apply this scientific method

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:46.790 align:middle line:90%
to mysticism.

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.160 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly the same thing.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.810 align:middle line:84%
The scientific
method, whether you

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:52.060 align:middle line:84%
are studying geology, or
mathematics, or physics,

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.640 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, goes through
the following stages.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.943 align:middle line:84%
You start off by making
observations in your field,

00:28:56.943 --> 00:28:58.360 align:middle line:84%
whatever your field
happens to be.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.130 align:middle line:90%
You collect your data.

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:03.550 align:middle line:84%
You begin to see possible
patterns in your data.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.460 align:middle line:84%
That creates a hypothesis to
explain the possible pattern.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.900 align:middle line:90%
Now, you've got to test that.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.250 align:middle line:90%
You got empirically test that.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:12.640 align:middle line:84%
So you set up an experiment to
test if the hypothesis explains

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.840 align:middle line:90%
the putative pattern.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.570 align:middle line:84%
If it does, it has to be
replicated by somebody else

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.738 align:middle line:84%
to make sure it wasn't a
statistical aberration.

00:29:18.738 --> 00:29:21.280 align:middle line:84%
If the other person says, yeah,
we got the same results, now,

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.260 align:middle line:84%
you have a principle
established in the field.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, a bunch of principles
create a model of the field.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.660 align:middle line:84%
But inevitably, there
will be new anomalous data

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.680 align:middle line:90%
present themselves.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have to
tweak the old model

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.140 align:middle line:90%
to accommodate the new data.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And at some stage, so
many anomalous data points

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.300 align:middle line:90%
present themselves.

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:38.800 align:middle line:84%
You can't squeeze
them in, no matter

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.060 align:middle line:90%
what you do, to the old model.

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.602 align:middle line:84%
You've got to
dismantle the old model

00:29:41.602 --> 00:29:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and build a brand new model that
can contain all the old data

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.000 align:middle line:90%
and all the new data.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And we did that twice
in the 20th century

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:53.300 align:middle line:84%
with relativity theory in 1905
and quantum mechanics in 1920.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, the mystics have been doing
that for thousands of years.

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:57.130 align:middle line:90%
You look at your data.

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:58.250 align:middle line:90%
You collect them.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.190 align:middle line:90%
You see a pattern.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.450 align:middle line:90%
You create a hypothesis.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:03.228 align:middle line:84%
You test it by looking
at all the mystics.

00:30:03.228 --> 00:30:04.270 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm doing this.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm meditating, spending
time in nature, whatever.

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Are you getting
the same results?

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm getting
the same results.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.690 align:middle line:84%
You establish a principle,
and a bunch of principles

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:14.600 align:middle line:84%
lead to a metaphysical
or a mystical model.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, as new
experiences come in,

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.390 align:middle line:84%
you try initially to fit
them into the old model,

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:20.223 align:middle line:90%
and they won't work.

00:30:20.223 --> 00:30:22.310 align:middle line:84%
At some stage, you have
to create a new model.

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And so people have
to be encouraged

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.850 align:middle line:84%
to constantly upgrade
the models of reality

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.567 align:middle line:90%
and their knowledge of religion.

00:30:29.567 --> 00:30:31.900 align:middle line:84%
But instead of that, there's
the fundamentalist mindset.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:32.840 align:middle line:90%
Shut them down.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.790 align:middle line:90%
Don't let them think.

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:34.720 align:middle line:90%
Here's the truth.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.040 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go
to hell if you don't

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.190 align:middle line:90%
accept my version of truth.

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And now, there are 4,300
versions of the truth.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, boy.

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:41.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:42.130 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So our own personal
cosmology is essential.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to fit a new
cosmology with an old one.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to work.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.050 align:middle line:90%
So Paul, I'm going to ask this.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:52.090 align:middle line:84%
We're going to-- you
can comment on that,

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:54.840 align:middle line:84%
but I want to go ahead and
forward it at this point, too.

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And that is, I want to get
back to the monotheism point

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:00.210 align:middle line:84%
because there are different
types of monotheism.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:02.820 align:middle line:84%
One of them is an angry god
that says obey me or I will

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.470 align:middle line:90%
squash you like a bug.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.918 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking about
Akhenaten's time, when

00:31:06.918 --> 00:31:08.460 align:middle line:84%
he was introducing
it, you're talking

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.770 align:middle line:84%
about a recognition
of the cosmos

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and the life-giving
force of the sun.

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:14.820 align:middle line:84%
These are slightly
different ways

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.430 align:middle line:84%
of viewing monotheism
and devotion,

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:18.790 align:middle line:90%
if you want to call it that.

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So we can get into that
in a bit here if you like.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:26.010 align:middle line:84%
But what you just said, instead
of keeping people small,

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:29.010 align:middle line:84%
reinforcing these
same dour views

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:34.310 align:middle line:84%
of what these institutions
stand for and what God is,

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:36.157 align:middle line:90%
we're now--

00:31:36.157 --> 00:31:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people
that watch these shows are

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:43.690 align:middle line:84%
wondering, are some of the same
entities or tribes of entities

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:45.440 align:middle line:84%
that were here, that
created these stories

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.950 align:middle line:84%
of the Old Testament,
still interfering

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.780 align:middle line:84%
in our understanding
of ourselves?

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And at the very top, top,
top of all of the systems

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:57.140 align:middle line:84%
and institutions today, is
their hands still present,

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:02.148 align:middle line:84%
trying to suppress human
spirit, curiosity, and genius?

00:32:02.148 --> 00:32:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>O'LAORIE: Take it away, Paul.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: I'd love--
all right, I'm

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.620 align:middle line:84%
going to get onto
that question, but I

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.810 align:middle line:84%
do want to comment on
what Sean just said,

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:12.350 align:middle line:84%
because I can illustrate that
wonderful picture that Sean

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.130 align:middle line:90%
painted at an individual level.

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Because,
I think, if you've

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:84%
come out of a coherent religious
worldview, then that can just

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.950 align:middle line:84%
leave you bereft, and
depressed, and living

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:28.250 align:middle line:84%
in a world where you're
overscheduled, distressed.

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:29.490 align:middle line:90%
There's no support.

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:31.910 align:middle line:84%
There's no assistance,
and that might

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:35.510 align:middle line:84%
be balanced by keeping yourself
entertained in the evenings.

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you move
forward, except I find,

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:43.460 align:middle line:84%
if I can ask anybody,
have you ever

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:47.270 align:middle line:84%
experienced something
you couldn't explain,

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.430 align:middle line:90%
everyone has a story.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And if I ask something
even more specific,

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:55.730 align:middle line:84%
have you ever experienced like
a flash of a higher cognitive

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:57.590 align:middle line:90%
power?

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, yes, I had
a flash of remote viewing.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I had a flash of
telepathic connection.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, very often
with coaching clients,

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.100 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, you
know, I'm beginning

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:10.970 align:middle line:84%
to believe that each one of
us has an invisible support

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.920 align:middle line:90%
cloud of helpers.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.920 align:middle line:84%
I've yet to have
someone not say,

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm coming to
believe that as well.

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And that hasn't come from
their religious beliefs.

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:24.360 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from
their experience.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And so, with
questions like that,

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking them to
notice the anomalies that

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:34.790 align:middle line:84%
don't fit their old worldview,
that don't fit their rejected

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:39.260 align:middle line:84%
worldview, and that point to
the need for a new worldview.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And as you join the dots between
your anomalous experiences,

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and those of the person
you're speaking to,

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:48.350 align:middle line:84%
and those of your
friends, a new worldview

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:52.220 align:middle line:84%
does form, one in which we
are not alone, one in which

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:56.630 align:middle line:84%
there is a universe of
resources available to you.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:34:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And it is such an easy
journey when you do

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.530 align:middle line:90%
it piece by piece in that way.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:07.530 align:middle line:84%
These experiences
really chip away

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:11.100 align:middle line:84%
at the foundations of the
old damaging mindset that's

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:12.840 align:middle line:90%
been so enslaving.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.389 align:middle line:84%
So I feel very
optimistic about people

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:18.939 align:middle line:84%
finding that new world view in
the way Sean was describing.

00:34:18.939 --> 00:34:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I think there
is reason for optimism.

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I look around
at mainstream everything

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:27.600 align:middle line:84%
pretty much, which is about
as cynical as it gets,

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.880 align:middle line:84%
which ridicules a
person for daring, even

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.730 align:middle line:84%
open up to their own
experience, discredits one's

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:33.989 align:middle line:90%
own experience.

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think, still,
what bothers me

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:39.690 align:middle line:84%
is the vast majority
of the population are

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:42.650 align:middle line:90%
living under those influences.

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:44.159 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: Yes, that's very true.

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have to
give each other permission

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.040 align:middle line:90%
to share those experiences.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.639 align:middle line:84%
So some of us have
to step out and be

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:55.909 align:middle line:84%
willing to be embarrassed or
be willing to be ridiculed.

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Because if I share
my ridiculous story,

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.730 align:middle line:84%
it gives freedom to
someone else to share

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:03.320 align:middle line:90%
their ridiculous story.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's a grassroots
thing we have

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.730 align:middle line:84%
to do to push this
conversation forward, I think.

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now back to the other--
and thank you for that.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.290 align:middle line:90%
That was a wonderful follow-on.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So back to the question I
asked you, which gets into--

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:18.650 align:middle line:84%
we talked about
this off-camera--

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:21.020 align:middle line:84%
some of these Pat
themes that we've

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.060 align:middle line:84%
had going on, even
at Gaia, calling us

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.770 align:middle line:90%
a slave species, et cetera.

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So both of you,
do you think there

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:32.240 align:middle line:84%
has been some
intentional governing

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.930 align:middle line:84%
factor to limit the
expression of humanity

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:39.650 align:middle line:84%
into these finer realms of our
native, being an intelligence?

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:42.440 align:middle line:90%
A, has there been a limitation?

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And B, do we still have
active participants doing this

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.820 align:middle line:90%
at this time, in your opinions?

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: I'd say yes.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Yes, in ancestral memory,
and yes, through history.

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.400 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at the
story of human origins,

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.310 align:middle line:84%
for instance, that comes from
the Mayan tradition, expressed

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:06.380 align:middle line:84%
in the Popol Vuh, the story
is told with amazing frankness

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:09.170 align:middle line:84%
that there were visitors
at one point who

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:12.110 align:middle line:90%
wanted a working class.

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And they engineered Homo
sapiens, the phrase was,

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:18.570 align:middle line:84%
to do the work for us
and bring us our food.

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And so they have a long
series of experiments.

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is way back into
our animal prehistory.

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:28.610 align:middle line:84%
The experiments result in
ape-like creatures who live

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:31.490 align:middle line:90%
in the forest, it says, and us.

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:33.380 align:middle line:84%
But it actually
resulted in beings

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.440 align:middle line:84%
who were far more
than they'd intended,

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:41.330 align:middle line:84%
far more intelligent, far more
conscious, far more beautiful.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:46.220 align:middle line:84%
It was us plus more
telepathic connection,

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.760 align:middle line:84%
better remote viewing,
better precognition,

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.320 align:middle line:90%
better self-healing.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the engineers in
the Popol Vuh stories,

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.400 align:middle line:84%
think, hang on, we don't
need them this clever.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Can we dial them
down a bit, so we

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.670 align:middle line:84%
can manage all we want as a
workforce, for goodness' sake.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And so they have an
emergency meeting.

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And they work out, the way
to dial the humans down

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:10.220 align:middle line:84%
is to spray a vapor
over human populations

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:13.430 align:middle line:84%
that will damage our
neurological health

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:17.000 align:middle line:84%
and shut off these
higher capacities.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.730 align:middle line:90%
Limit our vision is the phrase.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And just to unpack
that, if you think

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:26.870 align:middle line:84%
about how is our vision limited,
well, it's limited by surfaces.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.060 align:middle line:90%
We can't see behind things.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.960 align:middle line:90%
We can't see into things.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.333 align:middle line:90%
It's limited by time.

00:37:32.333 --> 00:37:33.500 align:middle line:90%
We can only see the present.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.490 align:middle line:90%
We can't see the past.

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:36.140 align:middle line:90%
We can't see the future.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.000 align:middle line:90%
It's limited by distance.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.470 align:middle line:90%
We can't see beyond the horizon.

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:41.700 align:middle line:90%
We can't see into deep space.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.980 align:middle line:90%
It's limited by frequency.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:46.790 align:middle line:84%
We can only see this
spectrum of radio waves.

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:48.350 align:middle line:90%
Whereas, a dog can see this.

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.270 align:middle line:90%
A cat can see this.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Take all those limits
off, all of a sudden,

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:56.360 align:middle line:84%
you've got X-ray vision,
remote viewing, future viewing.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:01.340 align:middle line:84%
How do you manage and manipulate
being that intelligent?

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.600 align:middle line:90%
And so, this was the story.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.430 align:middle line:90%
They sprayed a vapor.

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:07.620 align:middle line:84%
But there's a positive
take home from the story,

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.640 align:middle line:84%
and that is that
they didn't downgrade

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.160 align:middle line:90%
what we are within ourselves.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:17.960 align:middle line:84%
They put something into the
environment to dial us down.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And the punchline of that story
is that absent of that vapor,

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.550 align:middle line:84%
absent of those toxins
in the environment,

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:29.520 align:middle line:84%
you and I start becoming
healthier, more intelligent,

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.350 align:middle line:90%
more conscious.

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:32.930 align:middle line:90%
That's our natural state.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, the culture that
curated that story about us

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.400 align:middle line:90%
was the Mayan culture.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.510 align:middle line:84%
When the Spanish
and the Portuguese

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:43.760 align:middle line:84%
went into central
and South America,

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.940 align:middle line:84%
those were the stories
they shut down,

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.420 align:middle line:84%
along with the shamanic
and mystical protocols that

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:54.830 align:middle line:84%
existed in those cultures for
activating our higher powers.

00:38:54.830 --> 00:39:00.200 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to delete the
information and the knowledge

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.530 align:middle line:84%
of how to be more conscious
and more intelligent

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and replace it with
Christian orthodoxy, which

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:09.440 align:middle line:84%
they, the conquerors,
would provide

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:12.620 align:middle line:84%
through their churches,
their education system,

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.220 align:middle line:90%
so on, and so forth.

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And they created a
worldview for those living

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:18.830 align:middle line:84%
in Central and
South America, where

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:21.720 align:middle line:84%
you've got God at the
top of the pyramid,

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.570 align:middle line:84%
along with the Kings of
Portugal and Spain and the Pope.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got the army
and the Catholic priests

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:31.110 align:middle line:84%
in the middle, and then
the people at the bottom,

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:33.180 align:middle line:90%
praying and obeying.

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And so they've deleted this
worldview, where we all

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:41.610 align:middle line:84%
have inter-dimensional support
and assistance, where we all

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:43.980 align:middle line:84%
have higher cognitive
powers, and they've

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:47.640 align:middle line:84%
replaced it with this
feudalizing structure.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And in almost every
story of colonization,

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:54.690 align:middle line:84%
you can see that delete and
replace action going on.

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think, in a
way, it still goes on.

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
thank you for that.

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And you just said it,
this interdimensionality,

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:04.500 align:middle line:84%
they were looking at one-- the
story of the vapor is looking

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.320 align:middle line:84%
at one dimension of what it
is to be human rather than

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.430 align:middle line:84%
our multidimensional nature and
ability to access those higher

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:13.830 align:middle line:84%
realms of consciousness,
which were not--

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:17.310 align:middle line:84%
I guess, they, themselves,
were not skilled at that

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:21.660 align:middle line:84%
and thus didn't understand the
nature of multidimensionality

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:22.930 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>O'LAORIE: So when I trace it,
even through the Bible itself

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:28.950 align:middle line:84%
and into history subsequently,
I'm fascinated by it.

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, I don't believe
that the God in the Bible

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:32.340 align:middle line:90%
is the God.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.240 align:middle line:90%
I put the God on trial.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.370 align:middle line:84%
I just read a whole book where
I put God on trial against--

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:35.820 align:middle line:90%
I love your book.

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>O'LAORIE: --crimes
against humanity.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:38.808 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things I'm seeing is

00:40:38.808 --> 00:40:41.520 align:middle line:84%
that these sky beings
of various kinds,

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.500 align:middle line:84%
that when they
came here, there's

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.720 align:middle line:84%
this great story of
Babel, the Tower of Babel,

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:49.740 align:middle line:84%
where they said, let us
confuse their tongues.

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Now what I hear on this
wasn't that everybody spoke

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.350 align:middle line:84%
a single tongue before Babel
and that they confused us,

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:57.305 align:middle line:84%
so they're now speaking
different languages.

00:40:57.305 --> 00:40:59.430 align:middle line:84%
My belief system is precisely
what you were saying,

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Paul, is that people had
telepathic, clairvoyant,

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:05.220 align:middle line:84%
clear scent, clear
audio capabilities.

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:07.898 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was,
they taught them language.

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that they
confused the language

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:12.750 align:middle line:84%
by telling them reducing
all the languages to one,

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:15.690 align:middle line:84%
but that there were telepathic
exchanges, clairvoyance,

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:18.210 align:middle line:90%
precognition, cytokinesis.

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:21.990 align:middle line:84%
All these powers were
resident in the creation.

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:23.340 align:middle line:90%
And they shut them all off.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:24.965 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're
going to have to focus

00:41:24.965 --> 00:41:27.060 align:middle line:90%
on the verbalization of ideas.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you try to
put thoughts into word,

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.070 align:middle line:84%
words are very,
very leaky vessels.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:36.480 align:middle line:84%
If you look at any piece of
artwork, even for 10 seconds,

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and you try to
describe it, it's going

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:41.370 align:middle line:84%
to take you a million words
to describe what you've

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:43.350 align:middle line:90%
just witnessed and taken it.

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:45.697 align:middle line:84%
And so, words can't
do justice to it.

00:41:45.697 --> 00:41:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So you reduce it
down to one language.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.863 align:middle line:84%
Now, over time, it's spread
into many, many languages.

00:41:49.863 --> 00:41:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, historically, I think
what we've done with that

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:55.740 align:middle line:84%
and we realized that
every language creates

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:58.200 align:middle line:84%
a mindset, which
creates a culture,

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and it articulates
in story form.

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And stories become the
archived wisdom of the culture.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the colonials
move in, what do they do?

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:09.510 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is they try
to destroy the language.

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:12.190 align:middle line:84%
By the beginning of
the 20th century,

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:14.160 align:middle line:84%
there were 7,000
languages on planet Earth.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.690 align:middle line:84%
By the end of that
century, there

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:17.100 align:middle line:90%
were 5,000 languages left.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So there were 7,000
different mindsets trying

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:22.450 align:middle line:90%
to grasp the human experience.

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you shut down a
language, what you're doing is

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:27.570 align:middle line:84%
you're shutting
down the stories.

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:29.037 align:middle line:84%
You shut down the
stories, you're

00:42:29.037 --> 00:42:30.120 align:middle line:90%
shutting down the culture.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:33.090 align:middle line:84%
You shut down the culture,
you're selling the cosmology.

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:35.458 align:middle line:84%
And so you've left people
without a cosmology.

00:42:35.458 --> 00:42:37.500 align:middle line:84%
I know you come in, you
say, here's the language.

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Here's the culture, and
here's the cosmology.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do
with our technology,

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and there's a stratification, as
Paul mentioned so beautifully,

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.440 align:middle line:84%
a hierarchical system,
a secular version of it,

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.690 align:middle line:90%
and a religious version of it.

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And now, you've got the peons
at the bottom with no stories

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:55.170 align:middle line:84%
to tell, no cosmology,
no culture, no language,

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:56.670 align:middle line:90%
except that of the colonialist.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:58.830 align:middle line:90%
And now, we're powerless.

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's been actively--
throughout human history, it's

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.970 align:middle line:84%
been actively, including our
own, time's being promoted.

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, this is what
I mentioned a moment ago,

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:10.920 align:middle line:84%
that some of the other
offers, my friend, Michael

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Hollinger and others
refer to, as reducing us

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:14.760 align:middle line:90%
to a slave species.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.123 align:middle line:84%
Now when I even
say those words--

00:43:17.123 --> 00:43:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and we're just going to
wrap it up on this question.

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:20.970 align:middle line:90%
We're almost out of time.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:23.310 align:middle line:84%
How do both of you
feel about the notion

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:25.710 align:middle line:84%
that humans have been
reduced to a slave species?

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>O'LAORIE: I start
and Paul finish.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.682 align:middle line:84%
So I'll tell you a story from
my own tradition in Ireland.

00:43:30.682 --> 00:43:32.640 align:middle line:84%
There's a tradition in
Ireland, particularly up

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.300 align:middle line:90%
into the 1940s and 1950s.

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.090 align:middle line:90%
I was born in 1946.

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And all fires were trough fires,
what you might call pit fires--

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:41.790 align:middle line:90%
pit.

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pit, yes, pit.

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>O'LAORIE: We call
the trough in Ireland.

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:46.080 align:middle line:90%
So all fires were trough fires.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.210 align:middle line:84%
At night, when the
family went to bed,

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:50.550 align:middle line:84%
the mother would be the
last person to go to bed.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And she would take
the fire, wreck it,

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.780 align:middle line:90%
put all the embers together.

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:59.350 align:middle line:10%
And she'd put the dust
over the top of it,

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:01.350 align:middle line:10%
so the embers would stay
alive during the night.

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:02.612 align:middle line:10%
She would go to bed.

00:44:02.612 --> 00:44:04.320 align:middle line:84%
She'd be the first
one up in the morning.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.997 align:middle line:10%
She'd take the embers
aside, blow on them,

00:44:06.997 --> 00:44:08.580 align:middle line:10%
and put new trough
in it, and the fire

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:10.230 align:middle line:10%
would start right back up.

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:12.930 align:middle line:10%
Now, that is what mysticism
has had to do in our world.

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:15.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's been the
suppression of the embers

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:17.700 align:middle line:90%
of the Holy Spirit.

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, the
mystics of the world

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:21.700 align:middle line:84%
have always managed
to go underground.

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And Paul did a beautiful piece
in his last book on the Cathars

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.010 align:middle line:90%
in 13th century Europe--

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:29.875 align:middle line:84%
little groups who
kept the embers alive.

00:44:29.875 --> 00:44:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the mystics have
done throughout human history.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.590 align:middle line:84%
They're the mothers who put
the clinker and the fine ash

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:39.370 align:middle line:84%
on the embers at night, when
the soldiers are passing by,

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:41.620 align:middle line:84%
to take it away in the
morning, blow upon it,

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:42.820 align:middle line:90%
and rekindle the fire.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And there were houses in Ireland
in which the fire literally

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.160 align:middle line:90%
didn't go out for 300 years.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've read that in
other books as well as yours.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.973 align:middle line:84%
That's a beautiful
metaphor for it.

00:44:52.973 --> 00:44:54.640 align:middle line:84%
We're going to toss
it to you now, Paul,

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.930 align:middle line:90%
to make your final comments.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.630 align:middle line:10%
>>WALLIS: I think the story I've
just told from the Popol Vuh

00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:59.770 align:middle line:10%
illustrates it beautifully.

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:02.830 align:middle line:10%
I think there was a
slavery experience.

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:04.150 align:middle line:90%
That was part of our story.

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:06.460 align:middle line:84%
I think we have
experienced colonization

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:08.200 align:middle line:90%
in that way in the past.

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.080 align:middle line:10%
But even within the
Popol Vuh, that's

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.920 align:middle line:10%
not the explanation
of who we are.

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:16.120 align:middle line:84%
They created something far
more able and beautiful

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.500 align:middle line:90%
when they created us.

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And when we start
reading ancestral stories

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:24.280 align:middle line:84%
in the original languages,
as Sean was just describing,

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:26.770 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, we discover
that some of our neighbors

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:29.720 align:middle line:84%
come because they want
to be more like us.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.890 align:middle line:84%
They want what we have
in their gene pool.

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:36.610 align:middle line:84%
I think there's something unique
about our heritage, our animal

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:40.370 align:middle line:84%
heritage, our mammal
heritage, whatever

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:43.180 align:middle line:84%
ET advantage we got
in that Mayan story

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:46.790 align:middle line:84%
to create a species with a
unique capacity for love,

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:49.720 align:middle line:84%
compassion,
creativity that makes

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:51.280 align:middle line:90%
us attractive to our neighbors.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.380 align:middle line:84%
That meant that the
stories of first contact

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.150 align:middle line:84%
all around the world
are of beings coming

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:58.150 align:middle line:84%
to assist us and
support us, and that's

00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:00.650 align:middle line:84%
what we talked about earlier
with that shamanic view

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:01.450 align:middle line:90%
of healing.

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:02.450 align:middle line:90%
That's who we are.

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:04.660 align:middle line:90%
That's how valuable we are.

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:06.880 align:middle line:84%
We are far more than
slaves, even if it

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.660 align:middle line:90%
was a moment in our deep past.

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hear.

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.390 align:middle line:90%
Hear.

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Thank you both for that
absolutely beautiful end

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:14.602 align:middle line:90%
to this part of the discussion.

00:46:14.602 --> 00:46:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going
to do something

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:17.530 align:middle line:90%
we normally do not do at Gaia.

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:20.380 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have a
two-part conversation.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.240 align:middle line:84%
In part two of our
conversation, we'll

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.160 align:middle line:84%
look at how the Indigenous
people of the world

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:24.970 align:middle line:90%
view the gods.

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:25.930 align:middle line:10%
Stay tuned for that.

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:27.070 align:middle line:90%
There is a spoiler alert.

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:29.980 align:middle line:84%
It appears to be a completely
different set of gods.

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:34.260 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:40.000 align:middle line:90%
