00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:18.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
How many of you

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.093 align:middle line:10%
want to throw your
hands up in the air

00:00:20.093 --> 00:00:22.230 align:middle line:10%
when the subject of
banking comes up?

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.090 align:middle line:10%
Me, too.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.720 align:middle line:10%
It's no surprise
when you consider

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.420 align:middle line:10%
that the banking
system we've been stuck

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:10%
with for the last
couple of generations

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.360 align:middle line:10%
is nothing more than
counterfeiting and double

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.090 align:middle line:10%
speak.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:10%
But we can't change something
we don't understand.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.040 align:middle line:84%
To that end, I've invited
Ellen Brown, author and expert

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.260 align:middle line:90%
on banking.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And your website, WebOfDebt,
is really a phenomenal resource

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.527 align:middle line:84%
for people who want to
begin understanding this.

00:00:45.527 --> 00:00:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to say right
up front, everyone listening,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.940 align:middle line:84%
you need to pay
attention because you're

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.480 align:middle line:84%
going to hear a lot of
information coming at you.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And you'll probably want
to go back and watch

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.690 align:middle line:90%
this a couple of times.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
into a little video

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.980 align:middle line:84%
before you and I get started
that's a three minute

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.700 align:middle line:84%
video on the nature of
banking, what banks do.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.284 align:middle line:90%
So let's watch that.

00:01:07.284 --> 00:01:07.950 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Have you ever wondered
why there's so much debt?

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Or why the experts
and authorities

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.710 align:middle line:84%
seem completely unable to
solve the current debt crisis?

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason
they can't solve it

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.860 align:middle line:84%
is because they're trying to fix
and repair the existing banking

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.800 align:middle line:84%
But the existing banking
system is completely flawed.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.360 align:middle line:10%
It's the existing system
that has buried all of us

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.884 align:middle line:10%
under a massive
mountain of debt.

00:01:30.884 --> 00:01:32.550 align:middle line:10%
In the next three
minutes, I'll show you

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.380 align:middle line:10%
how the design of
the banking system

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:10%
guarantees that the
vast majority of people

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:10%
end up in debt and why
allowing the banks to go back

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.490 align:middle line:10%
to business as usual would be
the worst thing for the economy

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.910 align:middle line:10%
and for society as a whole.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.760 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.880 align:middle line:10%
But first, where do you think
all this debt came from?

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.710 align:middle line:10%
Many people would
assume that a bank needs

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.190 align:middle line:10%
to get money from a saver before
it can make a loan to borrower.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:10%
After all, isn't
that what banks do,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.140 align:middle line:10%
taking money from people
who want to save it

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.040 align:middle line:10%
and lending it to businesses
and people who need to borrow?

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.870 align:middle line:10%
Well, not exactly.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.190 align:middle line:10%
Here's a fact that
not many people know:

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.225 align:middle line:10%
a bank doesn't actually need to
have any real money before it

00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:13.320 align:middle line:10%
can make a loan to someone.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.185 align:middle line:10%
When you take out a
mortgage from the bank,

00:02:15.185 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:10%
the bank doesn't take that money
from somebody's grandma's life

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:10%
savings.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:10%
No, instead they simply
open up a computer and types

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.770 align:middle line:10%
some numbers into your account.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.860 align:middle line:10%
You get a huge wad of
money in your account,

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.270 align:middle line:10%
and you also get
a huge wad of debt

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.270 align:middle line:10%
that you'll be repaying
over the next 25 years.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.830 align:middle line:10%
But the money that you borrowed
was created out of nothing

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.440 align:middle line:10%
and just typed
into your account.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.030 align:middle line:90%
We know that's hard to believe.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:84%
But you don't need to
take our word for it.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.490 align:middle line:84%
The Bank of England
themselves say

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.460 align:middle line:84%
that "when banks make loans,
they create additional bank

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.120 align:middle line:84%
deposits for those that
have borrowed the money."

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:84%
These bank deposits are just
the numbers in your account.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.500 align:middle line:10%
And Martin Wolf, the
chief economics editor

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.350 align:middle line:10%
at "The Financial Times"
says, "The essence

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.010 align:middle line:10%
of the contemporary
monetary system

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.330 align:middle line:10%
is the creation of
money out of nothing

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:10%
by private banks,
often foolish lending."

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.080 align:middle line:10%
So almost all the money we
use today is made in this way,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.180 align:middle line:10%
out of nothing, by banks
when they make loans.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.970 align:middle line:10%
And the only way that
we, as the public,

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.530 align:middle line:10%
can get our hands
on this money is

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.800 align:middle line:10%
to go into debt to the banks.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.230 align:middle line:10%
In other words,
almost every pound

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.990 align:middle line:10%
that we need in the economy
to run shops, businesses,

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.940 align:middle line:10%
factories, schools,
and hospitals

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:10%
must first be borrowed by
us from a High Street bank.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And if one person has a
million pounds, the rest of us

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.370 align:middle line:84%
must be a million
pounds in debt.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.340 align:middle line:84%
If we try not to go into
debt, then the banks

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.500 align:middle line:84%
would be unable to create
money, and the economy

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.220 align:middle line:90%
would grind to a halt.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.680 align:middle line:84%
This is effectively a
whole scale privatization

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.970 align:middle line:90%
of the power to create money.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.969 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.797 align:middle line:84%
I think we should have at least
a somewhat better understanding

00:03:47.797 --> 00:03:49.880 align:middle line:84%
if we didn't understand
how banks function before.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.660 align:middle line:84%
That was a great little
three-minute video.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.860 align:middle line:90%
I looked at your PowerPoint.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.210 align:middle line:84%
You're getting ready to do
a sizable presentation here

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:90%
pretty soon.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I was
looking at in all the graphs

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.260 align:middle line:84%
and charts and everything
is the disturbing reality

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.380 align:middle line:84%
that the bottom 80% of
the world's population

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.549 align:middle line:84%
controls or possesses
only 5% of the money.

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLEN BROWN: Mhm.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And the top 1% possesses--
well, it depends.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Their assets are
35% of the money.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And I've forgotten what
the-- 42% was another figure.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.940 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, so there's
a huge disparity.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:10%
And the question is why is that?

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.310 align:middle line:10%
If you look at a graph of
their incomes, the 1%'s

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:10%
income gross has been growing
exponentially like this.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And labor, or the
ordinary-- the lower 80%,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.650 align:middle line:84%
their income, if
growing at all, is

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:84%
in a straight line,
linear growth.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So what grows
exponentially in nature?

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Only cancers and parasites.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] That's
not a good analogy at all

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.660 align:middle line:90%
to our economic reality.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: And in economics,
it's compound interest.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.570 align:middle line:90%
It grows exponentially.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.056 align:middle line:90%
So this is not sustainable.

00:05:11.056 --> 00:05:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that-- let me
just ask you a question.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.638 align:middle line:84%
Is that because
when you're talking

00:05:14.638 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:84%
about the people,
the top 1%, they're

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.590 align:middle line:84%
utilizing a banking
system that is immersed

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.800 align:middle line:84%
in compound banking, versus
the average person making

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.240 align:middle line:84%
a wage probably has
very little invested

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.290 align:middle line:84%
in any kind of
banking system at all.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So to take advantage of the
things that the wealthy can,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.350 align:middle line:90%
it's not even an option.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Is that why we're
pretty much flatliners?

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:84%
We're lucky if we can
just kind of get by?

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: Well, I'm not quite
sure what your question is.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.990 align:middle line:84%
But most people think
that if they don't borrow,

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.230 align:middle line:90%
they're not paying interest.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:90%
But that's not true.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.900 align:middle line:84%
35% of everything
we buy is interest.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And those are the figures
of Margaret Kennedy, who

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.680 align:middle line:84%
is a German researcher, and
she has collated numbers

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.760 align:middle line:90%
from every level of production.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.180 align:middle line:84%
So you have all these
different contributors

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.700 align:middle line:90%
to the production of a product.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And they all tend to finance
their contribution on credit

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.430 align:middle line:84%
because they have to pay for
their workers and materials

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.280 align:middle line:84%
before they have
a product to sell.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And even when the
product's ready,

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.280 align:middle line:84%
they have to wait
90 days, typically,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:90%
for-- it's 90 days net.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.660 align:middle line:90%
That's how their end buyer pays.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
long spread of time

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.945 align:middle line:90%
when they use a credit line.

00:06:29.945 --> 00:06:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Or, I actually know a small
businessman in that position.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And he used to have
an 8% credit line.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.920 align:middle line:84%
They canceled that because
of the whole problem

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.650 align:middle line:84%
of small businesses
getting credit these days.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.459 align:middle line:84%
And now he has to use
a 16% credit card.

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 16% card?

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yes.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.960 align:middle line:90%
So that's doubled his interest.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How can
you do business?

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's the problem.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can't do business.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: That's
what he's saying.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is true for a lot

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:84%
of small to mid-size
business people right now?

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you add up
all that interest,

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:84%
then 35% of everything
we buy goes to interest.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Another interesting
figure is that 29%

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:84%
of all corporate profits
go to the financial sector.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.530 align:middle line:90%
And what did they do?

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:12.926 align:middle line:90%
Really they're just middlemen.

00:07:12.926 --> 00:07:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Flooded in money.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So you could deduce
from that-- and this

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.780 align:middle line:84%
is the argument I was
making in this PowerPoint--

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.250 align:middle line:84%
that if we the people
owned the banks,

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:28.330 align:middle line:84%
or if banking and credit
were public utilities, then

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.620 align:middle line:84%
that interest would
go back to the public.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.620 align:middle line:90%
So what could you do with that?

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.230 align:middle line:90%
Either we could get products.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.020 align:middle line:84%
We'd be 50% richer, in effect,
because your products would

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.820 align:middle line:90%
only cost 2/3 as much.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So you could buy three
products for the price of two.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Or if you calculate
that all out,

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.040 align:middle line:84%
we could save a trillion
dollars annually.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So that means we would
have plenty-- collectively.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.920 align:middle line:84%
So we would have plenty of
money to do all those services

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.770 align:middle line:84%
that they've told us that
we have to privatize.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.180 align:middle line:84%
If we actually
nationalized the banks,

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.510 align:middle line:84%
we could have all those
services and things to spare.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Or we could eliminate
income taxes.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Now everybody's
ears are perked up.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Eliminating income taxes
because most of our income taxes

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.910 align:middle line:84%
go to pay, essentially,
the interest

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.511 align:middle line:90%
on the debt of the country.

00:08:17.511 --> 00:08:18.010 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Right.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Income taxes in 2011 were
$1.1 trillion, collectively.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Of that, $454 billion
went to pay interest

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.070 align:middle line:90%
on the federal debt.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume that
we had been borrowing

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.530 align:middle line:84%
from our own central
bank all along,

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.980 align:middle line:84%
as has been done by
Canada, for example,

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.380 align:middle line:90%
did it from 1939 to 1974.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.179 align:middle line:90%
Their debt did not go up.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:84%
They funded all kinds
of remarkable things.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.500 align:middle line:84%
That's when they put in
their medical system, which

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.240 align:middle line:84%
was, at that time, was an
excellent health care system.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:84%
It's gone downhill now because
they've gone into debt.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Because they quit doing
what they did for those,

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.200 align:middle line:90%
whatever-- 35 years or so.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.601 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:08.850 align:middle line:84%
So we could do that, borrow
from our own central bank.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Right now, the Federal Reserve
rebates all its profits

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.310 align:middle line:90%
to the government.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.460 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't know that.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And the Federal
Reserve doesn't really

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.900 align:middle line:84%
talk about it because
they were sort of strong

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.440 align:middle line:90%
armed into doing it.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.460 align:middle line:84%
It was in the
1960s, Wright Patman

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.920 align:middle line:84%
was head of the House Banking
and Currency Committee.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And he was trying to
get them nationalized.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.980 align:middle line:84%
He said you all are
printing our money

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.410 align:middle line:90%
and charging us interest for it.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.880 align:middle line:90%
He said that's not right.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And so he was trying to
nationalize the Federal

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Reserve, which, you know, is
actually composed of 12 Federal

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Reserve branches, all
of which are 100% owned

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:90%
by the banks in their district.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So to avoid that, they agreed
to rebate their profits

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:90%
to the government.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So now, the bonds that the
Feds had bought, the securities

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:84%
that the Fed holds, it returns
the interest to the government.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the bottom
line for the consumer,

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:05.914 align:middle line:84%
for the bottom 80%
of us is-- and I

00:10:05.914 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:84%
want to go into the
history a little bit, too,

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:84%
of how we ended up
in this situation.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.016 align:middle line:84%
Because it sounds to me, what
you're talking about, just

00:10:12.016 --> 00:10:13.640 align:middle line:84%
talking about your
friend, who's having

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.570 align:middle line:84%
to put whatever
aspect of his business

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.640 align:middle line:84%
he's having to put on
his credit card at 16%,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.910 align:middle line:84%
now that's going to be
passed along to the consumer

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:middle line:90%
ultimately.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we look at the inflation
happening and a lot of people

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.930 align:middle line:84%
put articles out, some of them
conspiracies, some of them

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.560 align:middle line:84%
are actually quite right
on as to why that might be.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.480 align:middle line:84%
But there are many factors
that are coming into play

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.180 align:middle line:84%
as to the increase
in price of goods.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:90%
So let's go back--

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: Can I-- I just
wanted to-- quick--

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:41.546 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, please.

00:10:41.546 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: So that was $454
billion on the federal debt.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:49.180 align:middle line:10%
Then there's $750 billion that
the banks collect in interest.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.020 align:middle line:10%
So let's assume
hypothetically-- it

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.110 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't be easy to
nationalize the whole system.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:10%
But let's assume
hypothetically that banking

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.440 align:middle line:10%
were a public
utility like water,

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.450 align:middle line:10%
like highways, et cetera.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So the profits would
go back to the people.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.090 align:middle line:84%
That way, if you add
the 750 and the 454,

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.290 align:middle line:84%
you get more than the
$1.1 trillion that

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:10.540 align:middle line:90%
we're paying in income taxes.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.680 align:middle line:84%
So you could either
eliminate income taxes,

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.230 align:middle line:84%
or you could have
an extra trillion

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.679 align:middle line:84%
to play with, to do
all sorts of services

00:11:16.679 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:90%
that we desperately need.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes total sense.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.765 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've been talking
about this for quite a while.

00:11:20.765 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
examples where this already

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.680 align:middle line:84%
exists that we're going to get
into, even one in the United

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.540 align:middle line:84%
States in the case of one
state, which you use as a really

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.390 align:middle line:84%
wonderful example
of what could happen

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.289 align:middle line:90%
if we went that way as a nation.

00:11:32.289 --> 00:11:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Do you mind going back and doing
over a little bit of history

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's start way back,
more toward the beginning

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.590 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Would you want to go pre War
of 1812, post War of 1812?

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Where do you want to begin?

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.097 align:middle line:84%
But we have to put Alexander
Hamilton in the mix somewhere.

00:11:51.097 --> 00:11:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, I would go back to 1691.

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:57.710 align:middle line:84%
That was when the
colonists came up

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.480 align:middle line:84%
with this rather brilliant
system of just funding

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.180 align:middle line:84%
their government
by printing money.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, today printing
money has a bad name

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.120 align:middle line:84%
because everybody thinks,
oh, hyperinflation.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
into hyperinflation.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.890 align:middle line:84%
But the way they did
it then, the choices

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.810 align:middle line:84%
were to borrow from the British
bankers, who were not actually

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:90%
lending gold.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.260 align:middle line:84%
They were lending
paper money that

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.760 align:middle line:90%
was supposedly backed by gold.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:84%
So you were still just
borrowing some money

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.050 align:middle line:84%
that was just
created by somebody.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.650 align:middle line:84%
But it was created by
the banks privately.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So the alternative
was for the government

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
to issue these paper
credits and pay

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.930 align:middle line:84%
for goods and services,
workers, and materials.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And then because these
were things, like,

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.550 align:middle line:84%
it started out it
was a little war

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.640 align:middle line:84%
that the governor of
Massachusetts had to fund.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't find
anyone to borrow from.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So he just issued these
little paper receipts

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.196 align:middle line:84%
to the soldiers
that basically said,

00:12:53.196 --> 00:12:56.240 align:middle line:84%
you know, you have delivered
x amount of service

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.210 align:middle line:84%
to the community, and
the community owes you,

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and you can spend those little
receipts in the community.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And then they
circulated as money.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:07.165 align:middle line:84%
And they retained their value
because they were accepted back

00:13:07.165 --> 00:13:08.510 align:middle line:90%
as taxes.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.600 align:middle line:84%
California tried to do that
recently, issue warrants.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.630 align:middle line:84%
But they wouldn't take
them back in taxes.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.767 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, you
can take our IOUs,

00:13:15.767 --> 00:13:17.350 align:middle line:84%
but we're not going
to take them back.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.516 align:middle line:90%
So of course it didn't work.

00:13:18.516 --> 00:13:20.931 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did that with Bosnia
on the currency recently.

00:13:20.931 --> 00:13:23.430 align:middle line:84%
I could buy it, but I couldn't
sell it back to the Bosnians.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And right here, I brought
these because they're so fun.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.840 align:middle line:84%
We have these little-- they're
antiqued reproductions.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.430 align:middle line:90%
Here's one.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.532 align:middle line:84%
One of them is from the
state of Massachusetts.

00:13:34.532 --> 00:13:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Here it is, state
of Massachusetts,

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:37.750 align:middle line:90%
as a matter of fact, for $8.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.990 align:middle line:90%
So what are these?

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Another one here
is in shillings.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.659 align:middle line:84%
These are little
certificates that--

00:13:42.659 --> 00:13:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: All right.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Well these were actually later.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.690 align:middle line:90%
So this one's issued 1780.

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's like 100
years later, and that

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.700 align:middle line:84%
would be during the
Revolutionary War.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And now one problem
with these was

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle line:84%
that they were issued-- these
particular ones-- is that they

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.300 align:middle line:90%
were issued as promissory notes.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.750 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they say that
the government will pay you

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:09.890 align:middle line:84%
in gold basically when the
Revolutionary War is over.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So they weren't actually
legal tender in themselves.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And so at the end
of the war, that's

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:19.090 align:middle line:84%
where we get into the
Alexander Hamilton problem.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.660 align:middle line:84%
They owed all this
money that they

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:25.650 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have had to owe if
they had paid in legal tender,

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.860 align:middle line:90%
in straight fiat money.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And plus, of course, they
owed the French in gold.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And the French weren't going
to take these pieces of paper.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's why
Hamilton had to set up

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:41.510 align:middle line:84%
this bank on the British
model, where they took all

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.510 align:middle line:84%
the gold that the
government did have.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And then they issued 10 times
that many notes, banknotes.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And everybody took
them because they

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.002 align:middle line:84%
thought they were
redeemable in gold.

00:14:53.002 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:90%
So it worked very well.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And they actually got the
economy back on its feet.

00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:00.330 align:middle line:84%
But what it did was
it put us all in debt

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:01.972 align:middle line:90%
for the last 200 years.

00:15:01.972 --> 00:15:03.680 align:middle line:84%
We've been in debt to
this banking system

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.580 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't have
to be in debt to.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're still into
that fractionalized banking

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.320 align:middle line:90%
And then what happened?

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Because I showed
you this off camera.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:15.120 align:middle line:84%
So now we have some notes here,
$5 notes, from the War of 1812.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So in taking a look at these,
you said there was a problem.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.714 align:middle line:84%
This is where something
else historical

00:15:21.714 --> 00:15:22.880 align:middle line:90%
occurred around these notes.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Hamilton set up
the first US bank.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And originally it was 80%
percent publicly owned.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.100 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, the whole
thing wound up being privatized

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.169 align:middle line:84%
and largely to the
British bankers,

00:15:38.169 --> 00:15:39.460 align:middle line:90%
which is what they didn't want.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But his
intention was that it

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.482 align:middle line:90%
would be publicly owned?

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:42.440 align:middle line:90%
Was that the intention?

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.023 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah.

00:15:43.023 --> 00:15:44.910 align:middle line:84%
He actually was opposed
to privatizing it.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.500 align:middle line:84%
But because they
needed the money,

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:84%
they wound up
selling the shares.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And Jefferson was opposed
to this bank all along.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And so he was instrumental
in getting the charter

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.410 align:middle line:84%
not being renewed
when it expired.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.790 align:middle line:84%
But then the War
of 1812 came along,

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:06.496 align:middle line:84%
and nobody really knows
what it was about.

00:16:06.496 --> 00:16:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.650 align:middle line:90%
What was it about?

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: Well,
allegedly, rumor has it,

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:16.190 align:middle line:84%
it was created by the
bankers to put us in debt.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.720 align:middle line:84%
The British bankers
wanted their colony back.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
war is always about,

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:84%
or that is a factor
always in war,

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.570 align:middle line:84%
is that the bankers, the
international bankers,

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.810 align:middle line:84%
the big bankers,
fund both sides.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.320 align:middle line:90%
And everybody gets in debt.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.434 align:middle line:84%
And then that's how they capture
you in this debt machine.

00:16:34.434 --> 00:16:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's right up to
modern day as a matter of fact.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.110 align:middle line:90%
That practice hasn't changed.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: So then Madison
had to set up the second US

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.330 align:middle line:84%
bank in order to do the
same thing over again,

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.200 align:middle line:84%
where they would do
fractional reserve lending.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And then Andrew Jackson-- I
mean that bank was seriously

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.000 align:middle line:90%
corrupt.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And Andrew Jackson
shut that one down.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And then we had a whole
period of free banking.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:03.270 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't work out well.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:06.760 align:middle line:84%
There were all
these wildcat banks

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.710 align:middle line:84%
that would actually issue
10 times as many banknotes

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:11.450 align:middle line:90%
as you had gold.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.740 align:middle line:90%
I was fairly reasonable.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.214 align:middle line:84%
But the wildcat banks
would do worse than that.

00:17:16.214 --> 00:17:17.880 align:middle line:84%
They would just issue
an issue, and they

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.256 align:middle line:90%
had nothing backing it.

00:17:19.256 --> 00:17:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And when people
figured that out,

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.579 align:middle line:84%
they would all rush to cash
in their banknotes at once.

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And there would be
a run on the banks.

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And there would be
a banking crisis.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And that happened, on
average, every six years

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.090 align:middle line:84%
for the entire 19th
century leading up

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:38.795 align:middle line:84%
to the-- that was the excuse
for the Federal Reserve.

00:17:38.795 --> 00:17:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The establishment
of the Federal Reserve.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: In there there
was the-- in the Civil War,

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Lincoln went back to what
the colonists had done, which

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:84%
was just issue paper
outright, issue money to pay

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:90%
for part of the war.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.460 align:middle line:84%
He didn't fund the
entire war that way.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.700 align:middle line:84%
But it worked very
well, the greenbacks.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And the North managed
to win the war.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And also with that extra money
added to the money supply,

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.840 align:middle line:90%
they funded the railroads.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean that was his big
contribution to commerce

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.360 align:middle line:84%
was getting this railroad all
the way across the country.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And there were many
other developments.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, business was
booming during that time

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.300 align:middle line:84%
because there was extra money
around to conduct it with.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.650 align:middle line:84%
But of course then he
passed away, or, sorry,

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:26.796 align:middle line:90%
was assassinated.

00:18:26.796 --> 00:18:27.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes, passed away violently.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In an untimely manner.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.563 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah.

00:18:29.563 --> 00:18:31.380 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.320 align:middle line:84%
But following the greenbacks,
which I think was 1862,

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.460 align:middle line:84%
there was the National
Banking Act of 1863

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.580 align:middle line:90%
and then another one in 1865.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And in that system,
the idea was to try

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.682 align:middle line:84%
to get the banks
on a stable system

00:18:48.682 --> 00:18:51.140 align:middle line:84%
because nobody could tell what
these bank notes were worth.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.520 align:middle line:84%
They all had the name
of the bank on it.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.007 align:middle line:84%
And the value of the
currency dwindled

00:18:57.007 --> 00:18:58.840 align:middle line:84%
as you got farther and
farther from the bank

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.670 align:middle line:84%
because nobody knew
what it was going

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:84%
to be worth by the time you
got to the bank to cash it.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.586 align:middle line:84%
So it was very
hard for merchants.

00:19:05.586 --> 00:19:06.960 align:middle line:84%
They had catalogs
where you could

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.882 align:middle line:84%
tell which were
the sounder banks

00:19:08.882 --> 00:19:10.840 align:middle line:84%
and what your currency
was allowed to be worth.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.580 align:middle line:90%
And it was a very unstable--

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was
not standardized.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:13.709 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:13.709 --> 00:19:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So the national banking
system was put in there

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.680 align:middle line:90%
to try to overcome that.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.480 align:middle line:84%
The banks would then
deposit some gold

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:84%
with the Treasury,
the US Treasury.

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And then they were allowed
to use these bank notes,

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.597 align:middle line:90%
issue these bank notes.

00:19:32.597 --> 00:19:34.930 align:middle line:84%
So it was a good idea for the
banks, the national banks,

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:36.760 align:middle line:84%
because they still
had their gold.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.871 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile they got to print
these notes with their names

00:19:39.871 --> 00:19:40.370 align:middle line:90%
on them.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.170 align:middle line:84%
But they said "National
Bank" at the top.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.360 align:middle line:84%
But a dollar was
then worth a dollar.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:84%
That did standardize the
value of the currency.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.550 align:middle line:84%
But they also taxed the
local banks-- or sorry,

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:56.080 align:middle line:90%
the state banks' bank notes.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was to
try to get everybody

00:19:58.450 --> 00:19:59.390 align:middle line:90%
to be a national bank.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:84%
But the state banks, rather
than succumbing to the ta--

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.850 align:middle line:84%
rather than becoming
national banks,

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.410 align:middle line:84%
that was the beginning of the
whole check cashing system,

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.550 align:middle line:84%
the depository system, where
they didn't use banknotes

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:14.050 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.940 align:middle line:84%
They were just issuing
credits that you would just

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.030 align:middle line:90%
write into an account.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:84%
You would write it
in into as a deposit.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.250 align:middle line:90%
And that was very unstable.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So you had runs
on the bank again

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.610 align:middle line:84%
because they would
issue many times more

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:28.300 align:middle line:84%
credit than they
had gold to back it.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.859 align:middle line:90%
So that went right up to 1913.

00:20:30.859 --> 00:20:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And the Federal Reserve was
supposed to stabilize that.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:35.441 align:middle line:84%
But obviously it didn't,
because we had the biggest run

00:20:35.441 --> 00:20:40.380 align:middle line:90%
ever in 1929, 1933, that period.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let me
ask you a question.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Now we're up to
the establishment

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.690 align:middle line:84%
of the Federal Reserve, which
is not federal, of course.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:49.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a group of men
sitting around a table,

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.740 align:middle line:90%
a group of bankers.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And up to that time, at several
points in this conversation,

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:59.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm essentially hearing you
say that the governments,

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.830 align:middle line:84%
local and otherwise,
were actually

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:06.050 align:middle line:84%
trying to put some kind of
control into the situation.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like over
and over the matter

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:12.720 align:middle line:84%
of money kept defaulting
back into these same hands,

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.220 align:middle line:90%
the banking hands.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as though the
government was necessarily

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:84%
complicit and evil
in any of this.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes they were
very much looking out

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.825 align:middle line:84%
after the interest
of the people.

00:21:23.825 --> 00:21:26.000 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
way it is today.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.640 align:middle line:84%
It seems to have been
totally co-opted into what

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.410 align:middle line:84%
John Perkins calls a
corporatocracy, where

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.200 align:middle line:84%
the banks run the
government now completely.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
roots of that beginning,

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:84%
beginning with the founding
of the Federal Reserve.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: The Federal
Reserve was set up

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.130 align:middle line:84%
by some international
bankers, big bankers.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So it was Rockefeller, Morgan,
who were normally rivals.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.290 align:middle line:84%
But for the purpose of
this, they got together.

00:21:53.290 --> 00:22:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And it was in response to a
big banking crisis in 1907,

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:05.710 align:middle line:84%
which rumor has it that Morgan
actually instigated himself

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:10.220 align:middle line:84%
in order to-- they wanted
to set up this system, where

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.690 align:middle line:84%
originally the Federal
Reserve printed the money

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:17.250 align:middle line:84%
and lent it to the government
and charged interest on it.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So that was the deal
that later, in the 1960s,

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:25.145 align:middle line:84%
that Wright Patman got all over
and said no, this is not fair,

00:22:25.145 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:84%
and tried to get
it nationalized.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.560 align:middle line:84%
It should have--
everybody thought--

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.580 align:middle line:84%
The opposition thought in
1913 that it was nationalized.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.560 align:middle line:84%
That was-- William
Jennings Bryan

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.480 align:middle line:84%
was the leader of
the opposition.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Before that, he had been
the populist candidate

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.580 align:middle line:84%
for a more nationalized
system, for a system where

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.650 align:middle line:84%
the government actually
would issue the money.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:48.300 align:middle line:90%
And he said absolutely not.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:53.630 align:middle line:84%
There was no way he would
endorse a system where

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:56.230 align:middle line:84%
private bankers would
be issuing the money

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.120 align:middle line:90%
and charging us interest on it.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So they changed the name
from the Aldrich Act

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:02.900 align:middle line:84%
to the Federal Reserve
Act, made it look federal.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.526 align:middle line:90%
And the language is so obscure.

00:23:04.526 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's still obscure.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's so obscure
that almost nobody knows.

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's shocking to
me how few people actually

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.060 align:middle line:84%
know the Federal Reserve
is nothing federal at all.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: And it's
very hard to read.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:16.710 align:middle line:90%
I mean I've read it.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:17.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not all that long.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.370 align:middle line:84%
But it is very
hard to understand,

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:90%
certain parts of it--

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
you're an attorney.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.976 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: --exactly what
they're talking about.

00:23:24.976 --> 00:23:25.646 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:25.646 --> 00:23:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:26.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:27.850 align:middle line:90%
So we have that.

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And then let's talk
about the gold standard.

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.571 align:middle line:84%
I know you have a
completely different view

00:23:31.571 --> 00:23:33.490 align:middle line:84%
about the gold standard
than some people have

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:35.410 align:middle line:90%
in terms of backing currencies.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about when we
went on the gold standard,

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.730 align:middle line:84%
off the gold standard,
and in your mind what

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:43.544 align:middle line:84%
has happened to us as a result,
at least the currencies.

00:23:43.544 --> 00:23:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: Well, we've
been on the gold standard

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:50.680 align:middle line:84%
ever since-- the Bank
of England came into--

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.000 align:middle line:84%
was chartered in
1694, so that was

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.080 align:middle line:84%
three years after the beginning
of the American colonists'

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.610 align:middle line:84%
system of issuing
their own paper money.

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:05.980 align:middle line:84%
So the Bank of England
is a privately owned--

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.090 align:middle line:84%
or it was then a
privately owned bank.

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:12.030 align:middle line:84%
It was actually nationalized
in 1946 but in name only.

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:14.160 align:middle line:90%
It's still the same.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.980 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, that's
more complicated.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:22.190 align:middle line:84%
But so the Bank
of England-- well,

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:26.360 align:middle line:84%
the king was fighting a war,
and he needed to borrow money.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And so the Bank of
England was allowed

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:32.750 align:middle line:84%
to set up as the king's
bank, basically, that

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:37.840 align:middle line:84%
would lend to the king
and the debt never

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.260 align:middle line:90%
actually had to be paid back.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.662 align:middle line:84%
It would just keep rolling
over from year to year.

00:24:41.662 --> 00:24:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And all you really had
to pay was the interest.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.036 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
what we have today.

00:24:45.036 --> 00:24:49.870 align:middle line:84%
We have a $15 trillion debt
that just keeps increasing.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Everybody freaks out over
that, but it's actually

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.190 align:middle line:84%
perfectly fine, because
we have a $15 trillion

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:56.270 align:middle line:90%
dollar money supply.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the federal
debt is our money supply.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:01.575 align:middle line:84%
And it's only the interest
that's the problem.

00:25:01.575 --> 00:25:02.370 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
second part, we're

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.420 align:middle line:84%
going to get into this a
little more because most

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.420 align:middle line:84%
people-- you're going to
have to break this down

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:11.026 align:middle line:90%
into second grader terms for us.

00:25:11.026 --> 00:25:12.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: OK, so now I've
forgotten what the--

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were talking
about the establishment

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.279 align:middle line:90%
of the gold--

00:25:16.279 --> 00:25:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Oh, right.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Currency of the
king and the borrowing

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.721 align:middle line:90%
from the banking family.

00:25:21.721 --> 00:25:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: OK.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:26.900 align:middle line:84%
So the Bank of England was
gold-based, theoretically.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Theoretically you could redeem
these bank notes for gold,

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:31.120 align:middle line:90%
the government could.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.420 align:middle line:84%
But they issued many
times more notes

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:39.530 align:middle line:84%
than they had gold on the
theory that the depositors only

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.880 align:middle line:84%
came for their gold 10% of
the time on the average.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: But all through
the 19th century,

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.850 align:middle line:84%
you had this problem
where you had

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.820 align:middle line:84%
runs on the banks
and banking crises.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.900 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work well.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:26:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And then in 1933, Roosevelt took
the US off the gold standard

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.910 align:middle line:90%
because he was forced to.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Because at that time, the
dollar was 40% backed by gold.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.790 align:middle line:84%
So that meant that every time--
when you had a run the bank,

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:15.170 align:middle line:84%
as they did then, when people
rushed into the bank to pull

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:19.450 align:middle line:84%
out $4 worth of gold, the bank
would have to call $6 worth

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:21.307 align:middle line:84%
of loans, because
there were actually--

00:26:21.307 --> 00:26:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The ratio.

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:22.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So the money supply was just
collapsing in on itself.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
there was no money

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:33.910 align:middle line:84%
to buy-- there was like
fruit falling on the ground,

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.220 align:middle line:84%
and people were starving,
but there was no money

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.010 align:middle line:84%
to pay for the
workers to pick it.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And there was no money to
buy the fruit at the market.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.690 align:middle line:84%
There was just a collapse
in the money supply.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So Roosevelt took the dollar off
the gold standard domestically.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.930 align:middle line:84%
But it remained on
the gold standard

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:53.510 align:middle line:90%
internationally until 1971.

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.346 align:middle line:84%
Nixon had to do the same
thing for the same reason.

00:26:56.346 --> 00:26:57.970 align:middle line:84%
The French cashed in
all their dollars.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: See now,
a lot of times

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.560 align:middle line:84%
that is portrayed as quite
a negative or downturn

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.670 align:middle line:90%
of events in the country.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.724 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying
not necessarily so.

00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:08.140 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to take a little
break for a couple minutes

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.580 align:middle line:84%
so everybody can kind of
shake their brain a bit

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.000 align:middle line:90%
and get ready for Part Two.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.273 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:27:14.273 --> 00:27:17.159 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:17.159 --> 00:27:21.020 align:middle line:90%


00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:21.790 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Ellen and I were talking
off camera a bit,

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and there was one part of this
historical piece of the story

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:29.160 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't have
a chance to address

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.310 align:middle line:84%
that we want to get
into, which was really

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:32.710 align:middle line:90%
in Benjamin Franklin's time.

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And this had to do with
the colony of Pennsylvania

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and a bank that was
established there.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard you talk
about this before and find

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.080 align:middle line:90%
it fascinating.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.670 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to
that, and then we'll

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:44.360 align:middle line:84%
go back to this whole
gold standard thing.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: OK.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.830 align:middle line:84%
This was when the colonies
were printing their own money.

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:50.980 align:middle line:90%
It was all very experimental.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew exactly
what would happen.

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And some colonies did over-print
and hyperinflate the currency,

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.830 align:middle line:90%
devalue the currency.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:00.860 align:middle line:10%
But in a few of
the colonies, they

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.460 align:middle line:10%
had a very sustainable system.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:05.270 align:middle line:10%
And the ideal, the
one that perfected it,

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:09.780 align:middle line:10%
was Pennsylvania at the
time that Benjamin Franklin

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:10.310 align:middle line:10%
was there.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:12.360 align:middle line:10%
And he was called the
father of paper money

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:16.540 align:middle line:10%
because he wrote about it and
popularized this whole system.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.350 align:middle line:84%
But what the
Pennsylvanians did that was

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:21.840 align:middle line:84%
different was that, instead
of just printing and spending,

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.020 align:middle line:84%
printing and spending,
the government

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.050 align:middle line:90%
would print and lend the money.

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And it would come back
to the government.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:32.620 align:middle line:90%
So it was called the Land Bank.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.350 align:middle line:84%
It was supposedly
backed by land,

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:38.270 align:middle line:84%
the farmers would
take out loans,

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.610 align:middle line:84%
and they would put up
their land as collateral.

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Although I guess the land
was never really taken.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.194 align:middle line:84%
It was just so that they
could back it by something.

00:28:45.194 --> 00:28:46.110 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have gold.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:47.235 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is by faith.

00:28:47.235 --> 00:28:48.402 align:middle line:90%
Faith is part of the system.

00:28:48.402 --> 00:28:48.985 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah.

00:28:48.985 --> 00:28:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Good faith is
part of a banking system,

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.310 align:middle line:90%
theoretically, yeah.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: So say you could print
$105, or whatever they're using

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:02.550 align:middle line:84%
and then lend $100
at 5% interest

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:07.050 align:middle line:84%
and then spend $5 on
the government's budget.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you would
have $105 out there

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:12.380 align:middle line:84%
to come back as
principal and interest.

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And then you could lend
$100 again, spend the $5,

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and $105 would come back
as principal and interest.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And you could do that
over and over and over,

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and you would never have
to inflate the money supply

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.980 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose of
paying the debt.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could inflate it
if necessary because you're

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.030 align:middle line:84%
productivity increased, and
you needed money out there.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So during the time that
that system was in place,

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:38.560 align:middle line:84%
they had no inflation,
price inflation,

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.350 align:middle line:84%
they had no government
debt, obviously,

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:42.990 align:middle line:84%
because they just
printed the money.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:46.315 align:middle line:84%
And something else
good happened.

00:29:46.315 --> 00:29:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why did it crash?

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean why did
that bank go away?

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: It was the
King of England.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Bank of England
leaned on the king

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.430 align:middle line:84%
to forbid the colonies
to print their own money.

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:04.000 align:middle line:84%
At first they only forbade
certain colonies-- well,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.865 align:middle line:84%
it was most of them-- but the
ones that were overprinting.

00:30:06.865 --> 00:30:08.281 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doing
well without them?

00:30:08.281 --> 00:30:09.490 align:middle line:90%
No. [LAUGHS]

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: But
Pennsylvania was allowed

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:12.930 align:middle line:84%
to stay in operation
and some others,

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:15.250 align:middle line:84%
because they did have
sustainable systems.

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:18.710 align:middle line:84%
But then Benjamin
Franklin made a mistake

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.280 align:middle line:90%
that others have made since.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.170 align:middle line:84%
He went to England
and argued the case.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:27.865 align:middle line:84%
So he said how well they
were doing and the colonies--

00:30:27.865 --> 00:30:29.907 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The sleeping
dogs lie principle.

00:30:29.907 --> 00:30:30.990 align:middle line:90%
Should have left it alone.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.531 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yes.

00:30:31.531 --> 00:30:33.820 align:middle line:84%
So he was trying to argue
that all the colonies should

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.290 align:middle line:84%
be able to print
their own money.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said that before
they were just wilderness,

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and now they were
doing marvelously well.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And everybody marveled at how
they had been so productive

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:50.180 align:middle line:84%
considering that they
started out with nothing.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the Bank of
England was not pleased

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.440 align:middle line:84%
that the bankers then
leaned on the king

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and the king forbade them
all to issue their own money.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And that supposedly
was a critical factor

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:06.630 align:middle line:90%
in the Revolutionary War.

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:09.300 align:middle line:84%
That then they had a
depression because they

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.790 align:middle line:84%
didn't have enough money
to pay their debts.

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And the farmers were
losing their farms.

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And so they just went
back to printing money,

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.640 align:middle line:84%
which was considered
an act of rebellion.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And we can go back to the gold
standard part of the story.

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:27.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's important
just kind of to tidy up

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:30.040 align:middle line:84%
that piece of what
happened there

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and why now we're even
hearing about currencies that

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:35.950 align:middle line:84%
are emerging, governments
demanding that we go back

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:39.280 align:middle line:84%
to some currencies that
are safe and gold-backed.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.580 align:middle line:84%
But let's tie the historical
piece in with that

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.480 align:middle line:84%
and then make your
comment on that.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: OK.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, then in 1971, Nixon
had to do the same thing

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:52.480 align:middle line:84%
that Roosevelt had done
because it worked fine

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.890 align:middle line:84%
as long as nobody
came for their gold.

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:59.270 align:middle line:84%
But in the Vietnam War,
we went heavily into debt,

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:02.070 align:middle line:90%
and DeGaulle could see that.

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And so he called our bluff and
took all his dollars-- traded

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:10.250 align:middle line:84%
all his dollars in for gold,
which was actually paid.

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:12.890 align:middle line:84%
But then the British tried
to do the same thing.

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And that would have reduced
our gold supply so much that it

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:19.120 align:middle line:84%
would have, you know, the
dollar would have collapsed.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:19.725 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, valueless.

00:32:19.725 --> 00:32:20.225 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:20.225 --> 00:32:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: And so Nixon took the
dollar off the gold standard.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:26.460 align:middle line:90%
So that system doesn't work.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.090 align:middle line:84%
The other alternative
that people

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:31.920 align:middle line:84%
talk about when they talk about
our gold standard is 100% gold.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.601 align:middle line:84%
But that totally won't
work because there's not

00:32:35.601 --> 00:32:36.100 align:middle line:90%
enough gold.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's not fluid enough.

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.610 align:middle line:90%
You need an expandable system.

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Our entire economy
runs on credit.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.100 align:middle line:84%
It's just like the
small businessman

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.590 align:middle line:84%
that pays his
workers and materials

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:52.100 align:middle line:90%
before he has a product to sell.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a man
who is a gold proponent

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:58.270 align:middle line:84%
himself, Antel-- I'm
probably pronouncing his name

00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:58.920 align:middle line:90%
wrong-- Fekete.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:03.080 align:middle line:84%
F-E-K-E-T-E. But he's written
extensively about this,

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:08.010 align:middle line:84%
that it was actually because of
real bills or bills of credit

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:10.240 align:middle line:84%
that the gold system
worked at all.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.130 align:middle line:84%
But if you have
all these producers

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:15.530 align:middle line:84%
at different levels
of production,

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and they all operate
on credit, you

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.110 align:middle line:84%
would have to-- the
way he calculated it,

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:24.380 align:middle line:84%
he gave an example of a drug
that had 90 different producers

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.460 align:middle line:84%
before the drug
made it to market.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:31.360 align:middle line:84%
It will cost $5,000 in credit
just to make a $100 product.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:36.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean that many loans are taken
out to make this end product.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.690 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
have to find people

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:42.660 align:middle line:84%
willing to lend their
$5,000 worth of gold just

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.320 align:middle line:90%
to make all these products.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And the whole system
will choke when

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:49.420 align:middle line:90%
you can't find those people.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we see in--

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.504 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What if,
theoretically, there

00:33:52.504 --> 00:33:55.100 align:middle line:84%
were enough gold to do
100% gold-backed currency.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.250 align:middle line:90%
What if that were the case?

00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:00.010 align:middle line:90%
Could it work?

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:02.324 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: Well, if all
the gold were out there--

00:34:02.324 --> 00:34:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have to have
an expandable money supply.

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:05.198 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

00:34:05.198 --> 00:34:08.879 align:middle line:84%
You can't start with a fixed
supply and keep it that way.

00:34:08.879 --> 00:34:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No matter what it is.

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:10.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:12.611 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: As long as you
have a debt-based system,

00:34:12.611 --> 00:34:14.960 align:middle line:84%
because you've got to
keep expanding just

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.239 align:middle line:90%
to cover the debt.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And we see that in the
Eurozone, where they've

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.830 align:middle line:84%
attempted to use a
fixed amount of euros.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
everybody's in debt.

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:27.719 align:middle line:84%
So they're all trying to
borrow from each other.

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:29.550 align:middle line:84%
But they're all
going down together.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
they're managing

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:35.650 align:middle line:84%
to pull out of it at all it
is that the European Central

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Bank has now agreed
to print and lend

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.330 align:middle line:84%
to the governments,
something that's

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:45.020 align:middle line:84%
a violation of their
original rules.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.550 align:middle line:90%
But I mean they have to do it.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:48.420 align:middle line:84%
First they were
lending to the banks.

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.760 align:middle line:84%
That just started
like last January.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And now they're actually
going to lend to--

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:56.600 align:middle line:84%
with this new European
stability mechanism.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.135 align:middle line:90%


00:34:59.135 --> 00:34:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.776 align:middle line:84%
OK, well let's talk about
the state-owned bank.

00:35:01.776 --> 00:35:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some
of the solutions,

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.394 align:middle line:84%
then, because we looked at
Pennsylvania a moment ago.

00:35:06.394 --> 00:35:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And you said that was
actually something

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.900 align:middle line:90%
that was quite viable.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.920 align:middle line:10%
But in more modern times,
we have a renegade state,

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.270 align:middle line:10%
the state of North
Dakota, which decided

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:17.910 align:middle line:10%
to take this upon themselves.

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:20.870 align:middle line:10%
And they established the
Bank of North Dakota.

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:23.910 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about it, in really
plain, simple, kindergarten

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:26.290 align:middle line:10%
terms, how that works,
why it's working,

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:29.330 align:middle line:10%
what has happened to the
people in North Dakota,

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:32.420 align:middle line:10%
their economic system,
compared to everybody else

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:36.840 align:middle line:10%
during this whole downturn
since 2008 in particular.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: The North
Dakotans in 1919

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.820 align:middle line:84%
set up their own bank,
the Bank of North Dakota.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is because the
farmers were losing their farms

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:46.370 align:middle line:90%
to the Wall Street bankers.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And when they
realized that, they

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.780 align:middle line:84%
decided they wanted to
keep their money local

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and use their credit
for their own purposes.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.700 align:middle line:84%
So it was the
nonpartisan league.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.790 align:middle line:84%
It was neither
Republican nor Democrat.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.660 align:middle line:90%
It was not about politics.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.965 align:middle line:84%
It was about the local ec--
it was local-- it was about--

00:36:04.965 --> 00:36:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Their
own preservation.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:06.923 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah.

00:36:06.923 --> 00:36:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: And they had
a very fiery leader

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:12.700 align:middle line:90%
who did great speeches.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And so they managed to set
up this bank, which has now

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.000 align:middle line:84%
been in operation for 93
years or something like that

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and has fought all
the-- the Supreme Court.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:28.600 align:middle line:84%
They've gone through
everything, and they've

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:33.570 align:middle line:84%
got a very stable bank now,
which is very profitable.

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:38.040 align:middle line:84%
It's returned I think $300
million in the last decade

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.980 align:middle line:84%
to the state government, which
doesn't sound like a lot,

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:46.524 align:middle line:84%
but North Dakota is 1/18 the
size of Los Angeles County.

00:36:46.524 --> 00:36:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:49.477 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's all
a relative scale.

00:36:49.477 --> 00:36:50.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah.

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:51.580 align:middle line:84%
It's really the
size of a county,

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:56.320 align:middle line:84%
of a modest-sized
county, not LA County.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's actually a lot
of money for their system.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.950 align:middle line:84%
They've returned almost
as much as the oil

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:05.050 align:middle line:90%
industry has returned in taxes.

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And so the beauty
of the bank-- they

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.280 align:middle line:84%
did not suffer from
the credit crisis.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:17.990 align:middle line:84%
The state has had a very nice
surplus every year since 2008.

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:19.365 align:middle line:84%
They have the
lowest default rate

00:37:19.365 --> 00:37:23.310 align:middle line:84%
in the country, the lowest
unemployment rate, the lowest

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:26.320 align:middle line:90%
foreclosure rate.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:31.320 align:middle line:84%
The Bank of North Dakota
partners with the local banks,

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.290 align:middle line:84%
so it allows the local banks
to make loans that they just

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:35.640 align:middle line:90%
otherwise couldn't.

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of getting around
this capital requirement, which

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.580 align:middle line:84%
is imposed from
abroad and I would

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:43.771 align:middle line:90%
argue is designed to keep a--

00:37:43.771 --> 00:37:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Keep a stranglehold.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.609 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:46.609 --> 00:37:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about if we were--
let's talk about the state

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:55.080 align:middle line:84%
of California, now the seventh
largest economy in the world,

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and establishing a state-owned
bank; how that would work

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:02.310 align:middle line:84%
once it's established;
what is given

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:06.890 align:middle line:84%
back by way of infrastructure,
services to the people,

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and so forth; and, again, in
kindergarten terms for us.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:11.180 align:middle line:90%
How would we do this?

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Because you're a big proponent
of state-owned banks.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.970 align:middle line:84%
How do you do it with
something as unwieldy

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:17.710 align:middle line:90%
as the state of California?

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:18.640 align:middle line:90%
What's that look like?

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.931 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: Well, it would look
pretty good in California,

00:38:20.931 --> 00:38:23.330 align:middle line:84%
I think, because California
has a huge amount of assets.

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:24.288 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Boy, does it.

00:38:24.288 --> 00:38:29.006 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: We have $70 billion
in a treasurer's pool that's

00:38:29.006 --> 00:38:30.380 align:middle line:84%
just sitting there
doing nothing.

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:31.546 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But wait a minute.

00:38:31.546 --> 00:38:33.050 align:middle line:90%
They argue the state's broke.

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:34.400 align:middle line:90%
They're shutting down parks.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.382 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:38:35.382 --> 00:38:35.882 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:38:35.882 --> 00:38:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: [LAUGHS]

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
the truth about that.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:38.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.110 align:middle line:90%
People don't know this.

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: Well, there
are all these agencies

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:47.230 align:middle line:84%
and local governments that
have-- all their extra money

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:50.850 align:middle line:84%
is put into funds, which are in
the nature of rainy day funds.

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:53.500 align:middle line:84%
But they don't want to share
with each other necessarily,

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want to give
it back to the general fund.

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And whenever the
governor has tried

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.650 align:middle line:84%
to get the money
to pay the budget,

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:05.120 align:middle line:84%
then-- well I know
there was a case where

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.500 align:middle line:84%
they tried to get-- Governor
Schwarzenegger tried

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.570 align:middle line:90%
to get the highway fund money.

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:12.020 align:middle line:90%
And somebody took him to court.

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And the court said, no,
that this was for highways.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.620 align:middle line:84%
It was earmarked for
highways, and you

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.520 align:middle line:90%
couldn't use it for your budget.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So all that money is
just sitting there.

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Right now it's in
a treasurer's pool.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:28.130 align:middle line:84%
There's other money
besides this $70 billion.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:33.380 align:middle line:84%
But those agencies that want
to use the treasurer's pool,

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.640 align:middle line:90%
that money is $70 billion.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.690 align:middle line:90%
It's earning 0.49% right now.

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:40.630 align:middle line:90%
So it's earning almost nothing.

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:41.800 align:middle line:90%
And it never gets spent.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.900 align:middle line:84%
You can look at a chart
of this whole fund,

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and it's done nothing
in the last 10 years.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.733 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If someone wanted to
take it on and do some research

00:39:48.733 --> 00:39:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and look it up, what do
they do a Google search on?

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: You can look at
the treasurer's website.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: And he's
got it in there.

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.147 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Treasurer's
Investment Pool.

00:39:59.147 --> 00:40:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Treasurer's
Investment Pool.

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:04.190 align:middle line:84%
So there's a $70,000
of money sitting there.

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: $70 billion.

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:06.648 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: $70
billion sitting there

00:40:06.648 --> 00:40:08.330 align:middle line:84%
that's not being
utilized at this time

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:12.120 align:middle line:84%
while they argue with each
other every summer about all

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.020 align:middle line:84%
the shortfalls and which
programs are going to be axed.

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And education
takes the first hit

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:19.480 align:middle line:90%
usually, and on and on and on.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.647 align:middle line:84%
I mean that seems rather
immoral, to say the least.

00:40:23.647 --> 00:40:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: But how do you
get around this rule

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.780 align:middle line:84%
that you can't spend
that rainy day money?

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.940 align:middle line:84%
In North Dakota,
that money would all

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:34.090 align:middle line:84%
be deposited in the
Bank of North Dakota.

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.650 align:middle line:84%
So what a bank could do
that nobody else can do,

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:39.710 align:middle line:84%
what a charter bank
is allowed to do,

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:42.860 align:middle line:84%
is to lend their money, even
though it's still in deposit.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So they basically
double the money.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:46.369 align:middle line:84%
So you could take
that $70 billion.

00:40:46.369 --> 00:40:47.410 align:middle line:90%
It's still sitting there.

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:50.650 align:middle line:90%
You could still pay them 0.49%.

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:52.274 align:middle line:84%
You could pay them
more than that.

00:40:52.274 --> 00:40:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they become a
depositor into the state bank.

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:57.489 align:middle line:84%
All those accounts, those pools,
are deposited into state bank?

00:40:57.489 --> 00:40:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Mhm.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.571 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:58.571 --> 00:41:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: And then,
well, ideally you

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.280 align:middle line:84%
would use a little for
your capital requirement,

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.300 align:middle line:84%
but there are other ways to
raise the capital if there's

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.280 align:middle line:90%
some objection to that.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but we're just
doing the kindergarten version.

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: OK.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:08.800 align:middle line:90%
So

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.235 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We can understand it.

00:41:10.235 --> 00:41:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Right.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:15.340 align:middle line:84%
You take your $70
billion and lend it.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:18.950 align:middle line:84%
One thing you could do is to
just buy plain old government

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:20.990 align:middle line:90%
bonds.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:23.050 align:middle line:84%
You know how when
they do infrastructure

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:24.410 align:middle line:90%
they issue these bonds?

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:24.642 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bonds.

00:41:24.642 --> 00:41:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.343 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah.

00:41:25.343 --> 00:41:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
fund the infrastructure.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:32.810 align:middle line:84%
So we are paying-- I
think in California

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:36.230 align:middle line:84%
the outstanding revenue
infrastructure type bonds is

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:39.420 align:middle line:90%
$155 billion in debt right now.

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Of that, $70 billion
was interest.

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you had funded your own
bonds through your own bank,

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.670 align:middle line:84%
if the government had,
we would be $70 billion

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:52.160 align:middle line:90%
richer in California now.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's one simple way to
do it is just buy the bonds,

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.892 align:middle line:90%
fund your own bonds instead of--

00:41:56.892 --> 00:41:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From your own bank.

00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:59.683 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: --instead
of putting yourself

00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:04.260 align:middle line:84%
at the mercy of this very
voracious bond market, where

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:08.960 align:middle line:84%
you have to get interest rate
swaps, which is what has broken

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Oakland and other cities that
have fallen for this Wall

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:14.780 align:middle line:90%
Street scam.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you just lend
to yourself, you

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.890 align:middle line:84%
can eliminate the interest,
which is 35-- well,

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:23.840 align:middle line:84%
it's actually 40% of public
projects is interest.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Or you could partner
with the local banks,

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:29.630 align:middle line:84%
like they do in North Dakota,
and expand the lending

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.680 align:middle line:90%
possibility of the local banks.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So my friend who is
now paying 16% interest

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:37.030 align:middle line:90%
could be paying the 8%.

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:38.960 align:middle line:84%
He could have his
credit line again.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.480 align:middle line:84%
They would have
that-- the wherewithal

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.640 align:middle line:84%
to make the loans
it used to make.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.697 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about Japan.

00:42:45.697 --> 00:42:47.530 align:middle line:84%
I heard you in an
interview recently talking

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:50.610 align:middle line:84%
about what Japan has been
doing and the way in which they

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:54.290 align:middle line:84%
interface with this subject,
which has some similarities.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:55.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah.

00:42:55.640 --> 00:43:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Japan is considered-- they have
the worst debt-to-GDP ratio

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:03.000 align:middle line:84%
of any major country
in the world.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And everybody thinks,
oh, the poor Japanese.

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I think they have something
like 220% of the GDP is debt.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.900 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, the debt
is to themselves.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.000 align:middle line:84%
They have borrowed from
their own central bank

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.340 align:middle line:84%
and from their own
Japan Post Bank, which

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.977 align:middle line:90%
is a government-owned bank.

00:43:24.977 --> 00:43:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Japan Post Bank is where--

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is like aligned
with the postal service?

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:28.723 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah.

00:43:28.723 --> 00:43:29.790 align:middle line:90%
It is the postal service.

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:32.000 align:middle line:84%
But they also have
banking services.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's where the people
deposit their money.

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:40.120 align:middle line:84%
So the interest on the federal
debt is going to the people.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:43.410 align:middle line:90%
It is their pension basically.

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:51.500 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like a dividend for
saving and for being Japanese.

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.640 align:middle line:84%
So all the money is
staying in Japan.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.510 align:middle line:84%
They don't owe it to
foreign creditors.

00:43:56.510 --> 00:44:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile,
they have-- they're

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:04.150 align:middle line:84%
at the top of the market
for all these electronics.

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And I mean their export
business is huge.

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:09.030 align:middle line:90%
They're doing very, very well.

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:12.720 align:middle line:84%
But they've sort of
hidden behind this debt

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:13.512 align:middle line:90%
to GDP ratio thing.

00:44:13.512 --> 00:44:14.886 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they don't want

00:44:14.886 --> 00:44:16.760 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the world
to know exactly?

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: Well, there's a lot
of written out there about how

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:23.230 align:middle line:84%
World War II was actually--
I mean if you want to get

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:24.500 align:middle line:90%
into conspiracy theories--

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just a little bit.

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: --that both Germany
and Japan were doing great

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.160 align:middle line:84%
during the '30s
because they were just

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.510 align:middle line:90%
printing their own money.

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And so it was to bring them
down that-- World War II,

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.150 align:middle line:84%
whether it was designed that way
or not, it did bring them down.

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And so the Japanese could
see that if they wanted

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:47.960 align:middle line:84%
to survive in this
system, they had

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.410 align:middle line:90%
to be a little more discreet.

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:50.980 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't just print.

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:52.850 align:middle line:84%
So they borrowed
from their own bank

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:54.900 align:middle line:84%
so it looked like
they were in debt.

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.776 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, they were
in debt to themselves.

00:44:56.776 --> 00:44:58.066 align:middle line:90%
So they're still just printing.

00:44:58.066 --> 00:44:59.190 align:middle line:90%
But they're printing debt.

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what
they're doing is smart.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.149 align:middle line:90%
And we should be taking note.

00:45:02.149 --> 00:45:04.189 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about other
countries who have already

00:45:04.189 --> 00:45:06.260 align:middle line:84%
implemented the same kind
of banking in the past.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And there is-- and
I would like to get

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:11.860 align:middle line:84%
to it if we have a chance--
there are some articles that

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:15.130 align:middle line:84%
are starting to pop up about
a new kind of bank that

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:17.390 align:middle line:84%
is specifically
investment oriented

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:20.090 align:middle line:84%
banks for small and
medium sized businesses,

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:21.920 align:middle line:90%
how we have a need for this now.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.850 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
Germany, for example,

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and anywhere else
that has already

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:28.190 align:middle line:84%
implemented this
kind of banking.

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: In Germany
and Japan, they

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:34.910 align:middle line:84%
have systems that are--
it's alternative banking

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:40.400 align:middle line:84%
or public banking where they're
designed to serve the economy

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and to serve the businesses,
rather than our type of banking

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:46.750 align:middle line:90%
is designed to extract interest.

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And so it's all
based on collateral,

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:51.756 align:middle line:84%
which means only the
rich can get loans.

00:45:51.756 --> 00:45:53.130 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
the collateral,

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:54.470 align:middle line:90%
you can't get thee loan.

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:57.400 align:middle line:84%
If you just have a good business
idea, you can't get a loan,

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.090 align:middle line:90%
but in Germany and Japan--

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, Japan's model is--
they're called keiretsu, where

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:06.940 align:middle line:84%
you have a group of corporations
that own their own bank.

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And so the bank funds
the corporations,

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:12.227 align:middle line:84%
advances credit to
the corporations.

00:46:12.227 --> 00:46:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And they all put their
deposits in the bank.

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.412 align:middle line:84%
And so they're really
borrowing from themselves.

00:46:16.412 --> 00:46:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
closed loop again.

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Mhm.

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: And in Germany,
it's the same deal,

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.340 align:middle line:84%
where the public
banks are designed

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.530 align:middle line:90%
to serve the businesses.

00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:27.610 align:middle line:90%
They take the long view.

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:30.444 align:middle line:90%


00:46:30.444 --> 00:46:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:31.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:32.180 align:middle line:90%
So we have that.

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the reflections
on the Bank of North Dakota.

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And yet we can't seem
to find our way out

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:43.024 align:middle line:84%
of this, because there seems
to be some resistance, which

00:46:43.024 --> 00:46:44.690 align:middle line:84%
could have something
to do with the fact

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:48.350 align:middle line:84%
that the largest lobbying
group on Capitol Hill

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:49.980 align:middle line:84%
happens to be the
banking industry.

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.605 align:middle line:84%
Could that have
anything to do with why

00:46:51.605 --> 00:46:53.120 align:middle line:90%
we're not seeing these changes?

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Right.

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:53.530 align:middle line:90%
Completely.

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:55.696 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've been
speaking about this for years.

00:46:55.696 --> 00:46:57.515 align:middle line:84%
And others are on
board with you on this.

00:46:57.515 --> 00:46:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And we can, I think just
from the little bit you've

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.460 align:middle line:84%
explained, we can
see the logic in it.

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.520 align:middle line:90%
But it's not happening.

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: Well, the federal
level is locked up.

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:09.830 align:middle line:90%
The banks own Congress.

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:12.340 align:middle line:84%
That's been said and
that seems to be true.

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:15.730 align:middle line:84%
But on this local level, there
are still things you could do.

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:17.970 align:middle line:10%
The cities and the
counties are run

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:20.880 align:middle line:10%
by a handful of
commissioners or councilmen.

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.235 align:middle line:10%
And they're approachable.

00:47:22.235 --> 00:47:23.360 align:middle line:10%
And you could talk to them.

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.630 align:middle line:10%
And so they could
very quietly-- this

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:28.440 align:middle line:10%
is what I envision happening--
is this very quiet sort

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:32.690 align:middle line:10%
of grassroots movement
where they just set up--

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:34.140 align:middle line:10%
you could call it
something else,

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:39.500 align:middle line:10%
like Washington state is
calling it an investment trust.

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.600 align:middle line:84%
If you call it a public bank
you might be bringing down

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.580 align:middle line:90%
the ire of the bankers.

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:49.840 align:middle line:84%
But what you need is
a financial system

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:53.250 align:middle line:84%
that serves the people,
where the profits go back

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:54.050 align:middle line:90%
to the people.

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And that is a
sustainable system.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And the model's been proven
globally and historically.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just that it's
always defeated

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:11.470 align:middle line:84%
by the big international cartel
that is more powerful and more

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:14.919 align:middle line:84%
based on this extractive
model of extracting interest.

00:48:14.919 --> 00:48:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
some of the articles

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:18.334 align:middle line:84%
I've read recently--
there are only a couple.

00:48:18.334 --> 00:48:21.760 align:middle line:84%
They're just starting to surface
about some nebulous new banking

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.480 align:middle line:90%
system coming up.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Francois Holland, the
new president in France,

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.280 align:middle line:84%
is calling for it
and saying they're

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.290 align:middle line:84%
going to roll their
public bank, which

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:33.600 align:middle line:84%
is going to be for the
purpose of investing

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.125 align:middle line:90%
in small to mid-size businesses.

00:48:35.125 --> 00:48:37.560 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
rolling this model out

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:40.370 align:middle line:84%
to help get the people back on
their feet again and to work.

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:43.910 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm reading
is that, as you say,

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:47.980 align:middle line:84%
this is not collateral-
or asset-backed lending.

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:51.740 align:middle line:84%
The lending would be based
on cash flows of a company.

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's a big
distinction here.

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:55.130 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's use an example.

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's say your town does not
have a dog grooming parlor.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:00.507 align:middle line:90%
And you love dogs.

00:49:00.507 --> 00:49:02.090 align:middle line:84%
You know how to do
this thing, and you

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:04.390 align:middle line:84%
want to set up a dog
grooming business.

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
the bank to say, hey,

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.220 align:middle line:84%
I want to do my dog
grooming business.

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:12.010 align:middle line:84%
What's the bank going to look
at under the current model,

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:15.746 align:middle line:84%
the restrictive model,
versus that other new model?

00:49:15.746 --> 00:49:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: Well, they'll
look at your buildings

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.150 align:middle line:84%
and your physical
assets that they

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:22.930 align:middle line:90%
can attach when you default.

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're probably
expecting you to default.

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:26.355 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's--

00:49:26.355 --> 00:49:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
whole system's banking

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:29.760 align:middle line:84%
on your failure,
no pun intended.

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah.

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
banking on your failure.

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And then they're going to take
your stuff back and resell it?

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Mhm.

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:39.340 align:middle line:84%
But the other
model has been done

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:42.840 align:middle line:84%
globally and
historically very well.

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:47.320 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese, the Koreans,
the whole Asian model

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:50.024 align:middle line:84%
is where you extend
credit to your businesses

00:49:50.024 --> 00:49:51.190 align:middle line:90%
and support your businesses.

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:55.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we call that a
violation of the World Trade

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:56.470 align:middle line:90%
Organization rules.

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:57.740 align:middle line:90%
And we say, they're cheating.

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:00.360 align:middle line:84%
They're supporting
their businesses

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:05.160 align:middle line:84%
by letting them-- well, they're
called nonperforming loans.

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:09.670 align:middle line:84%
But the way the Chinese did it,
they had no intention of-- they

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:11.490 align:middle line:84%
don't call it-- these
are grants basically.

00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:13.406 align:middle line:84%
They're just supporting
their export business.

00:50:13.406 --> 00:50:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But isn't it more
of a genuine partnership

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:19.250 align:middle line:84%
where the lender is looking
to help sustain the health

00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:21.500 align:middle line:90%
and longevity of a business?

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is not what we've been
doing, certainly in the United

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.830 align:middle line:90%
States, for quite a long time.

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:27.345 align:middle line:84%
The industry hasn't
been doing it.

00:50:27.345 --> 00:50:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Right.

00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:30.290 align:middle line:84%
That's the German model,
the Japanese model.

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:34.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the Islamic
model, usary-free--

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about Islamic banking.

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:40.550 align:middle line:84%
There you're talking about
essentially a lack of interest,

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:41.680 align:middle line:90%
no pun intended.

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:42.670 align:middle line:90%
There is no interest.

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:43.380 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:44.790 align:middle line:90%
There's no interest.

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:45.760 align:middle line:90%
But there is a fee.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain how
Islamic banking works?

00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Some people have heard
about this already.

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: Well, from
what I've read,

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:54.940 align:middle line:90%
they're still experimenting.

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:58.620 align:middle line:84%
It was in the Koran that
interest is forbidden.

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:03.900 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't really
tried on a national level

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:08.670 align:middle line:84%
until Iran became a
religious state in the 1970s.

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's where most of the
big Islamic banks are right now.

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:19.370 align:middle line:84%
But some critics, like
some Islamic clerics,

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:22.960 align:middle line:84%
say that they're cheating
and that they're really

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.440 align:middle line:90%
getting interest by other means.

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Because what they do is,
say if they make a loan,

00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:30.080 align:middle line:84%
they double the
price of the house.

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.542 align:middle line:84%
So you pay twice as much
over the time of the loan.

00:51:32.542 --> 00:51:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is that true?

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:35.291 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from what you've
been able to tell?

00:51:35.291 --> 00:51:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Some.

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:39.260 align:middle line:84%
I haven't heard of a
really good, effective,

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:41.540 align:middle line:90%
interest-free model yet.

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I like
the public banking model

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:45.610 align:middle line:84%
where you charge
interest, which is

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:48.970 align:middle line:84%
a way of-- If you have
a 4% default rate,

00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:51.160 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have to
charge 4% interest just

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:53.840 align:middle line:84%
to make up for the defaults or
you're going to go bankrupt.

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.740 align:middle line:84%
So I like the model of
the interest going back

00:51:56.740 --> 00:52:00.390 align:middle line:84%
to the people, either
as a cooperative model

00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:03.600 align:middle line:84%
or as a public model,
which seems to me

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:07.420 align:middle line:84%
overcomes any ethical
objections but still

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.830 align:middle line:90%
is a sustainable system.

00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So going back for just
a moment to the person who--

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:15.690 align:middle line:84%
so let's say this person
applying for their loan

00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:17.189 align:middle line:84%
to start their dog
grooming business

00:52:17.189 --> 00:52:18.650 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have a building.

00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Now under this
other model you're

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:22.550 align:middle line:84%
talking about, say if
it's a state-owned bank,

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:25.260 align:middle line:84%
and if we're looking at
not lending money based

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:28.670 align:middle line:84%
on assets but on cash flow,
how would a little business

00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:30.360 align:middle line:84%
like that work within
this closed loop

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:32.645 align:middle line:84%
model you're talking
about, a locally owned

00:52:32.645 --> 00:52:36.350 align:middle line:90%
or state owned banks?

00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: You would still
need some sort of record

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:41.975 align:middle line:84%
to show that you had
a cash flow, that you

00:52:41.975 --> 00:52:43.640 align:middle line:90%
were going to produce something.

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Even in North Dakota, we have
a retired Bank of North Dakota

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.630 align:middle line:84%
man on our advisory
board, and he

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:53.670 align:middle line:84%
says we are not
development people.

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:58.030 align:middle line:84%
We do not fund businesses
that are going to go bankrupt.

00:52:58.030 --> 00:53:01.880 align:middle line:84%
We're bankers, and we look at
the viability of the business

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.650 align:middle line:90%
as anyone else would.

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:08.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, more so than
banks in other states,

00:53:08.110 --> 00:53:10.790 align:middle line:84%
which were selling their
loans off to investors

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:12.349 align:middle line:90%
so they don't care whether the--

00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Business fails.

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:14.115 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Right.

00:53:14.115 --> 00:53:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:16.870 align:middle line:84%
So you're entering
into a partnership.

00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: It is a partnership.

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.840 align:middle line:84%
They want the business to
succeed because they're

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.620 align:middle line:84%
going to keep that
loan on their books.

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want
it going into default.

00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well let's go
into more personal levels.

00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:30.890 align:middle line:84%
People watching this have
feelings about all of this.

00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And one segment, a big
segment now, feels,

00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:37.880 align:middle line:90%
let them crash and burn.

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.550 align:middle line:90%
These are horrible practices.

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:44.210 align:middle line:84%
We've been enslaved to
our monetary systems.

00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Our government's enslaved,
our politicians are enslaved.

00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:49.140 align:middle line:90%
So let them crash and burn.

00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.610 align:middle line:84%
What's the reality
of the banking system

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:54.210 align:middle line:84%
crashing and burning from
a pragmatic point of view?

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: Well, the
too big to fail

00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:00.310 align:middle line:84%
banks really are too
big to just let them go.

00:54:00.310 --> 00:54:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Instead of-- I mean, they've
got their little tentacles

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:05.180 align:middle line:90%
in everything globally.

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:07.040 align:middle line:90%
I would feel quite nervous .

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.970 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't travel anymore.

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:11.970 align:middle line:84%
What are you going to
use for your Visa card?

00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:14.834 align:middle line:84%
But they are not too
big to nationalize.

00:54:14.834 --> 00:54:16.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that would
be the solution

00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:18.740 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me is we the
people should take them over.

00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Keep the bank.

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Change the name.

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:23.540 align:middle line:90%
And make it ours.

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:26.922 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do we, if we're
part of the 80% on the bottom,

00:54:26.922 --> 00:54:28.630 align:middle line:84%
most of us, and almost
everybody watching

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:31.380 align:middle line:84%
is probably part of
the 80% on the bottom.

00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:33.212 align:middle line:90%
What do we do now?

00:54:33.212 --> 00:54:34.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what do we do
with whatever money

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:36.520 align:middle line:90%
we may still have?

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Are their choices?

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Do you stay with the big
privately owned banks?

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you find other little
local credit unions?

00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:48.320 align:middle line:90%
What do we do with our money?

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: That is difficult.

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:53.190 align:middle line:90%
It depends on who you are.

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Credit unions are a
great idea, of course.

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.090 align:middle line:90%
And that is a cooperative model.

00:54:57.090 --> 00:55:00.560 align:middle line:84%
But there are limitations
to a credit union.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you have your own small
business, you may find, I mean,

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.830 align:middle line:84%
I've heard people say that
they just can't work well.

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:11.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I know-- there are
several cities in California

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:13.860 align:middle line:84%
that were talking about
moving their money out

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.300 align:middle line:90%
of Wall Street into local banks.

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And the credit unions are
not big enough for that.

00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:23.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So can we use
established local banks?

00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Can they come on board?

00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Are they allowed to come on
board with a, say a mandate

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:29.460 align:middle line:84%
or request on
behalf of the people

00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:32.290 align:middle line:84%
to start serving in
this public capacity?

00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Do they have the
right to do that?

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: I guess I
don't understand.

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you have
a local bank, OK?

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Not a B of A or something, but
a local bank that's established,

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.280 align:middle line:84%
can they go into partnership
with that community

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:46.240 align:middle line:84%
to become more of the
model you're talking about?

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: Well, in
North Dakota, it's

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:50.760 align:middle line:84%
the bank of North
Dakota that allows

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:57.542 align:middle line:84%
these small banks to expand and
take on a lot more deposits.

00:55:57.542 --> 00:55:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we have
to lobby on a larger

00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:00.450 align:middle line:90%
level it's sounding like.

00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah.

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Well, yeah.

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.656 align:middle line:84%
The first thing-- you either
have to go to your-- approach

00:56:04.656 --> 00:56:07.210 align:middle line:90%
your legislator-- but local.

00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:09.140 align:middle line:90%
Go local.

00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:10.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't have time
to go into the county

00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:12.070 align:middle line:84%
bank possibilities
I don't think.

00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:13.028 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, we don't.

00:56:13.028 --> 00:56:14.862 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: But you could
fix the real estate--

00:56:14.862 --> 00:56:16.277 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Problem
in no time flat.

00:56:16.277 --> 00:56:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWN: --problems
with county banks.

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So OK.

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:20.461 align:middle line:84%
So it sounds like
we have to-- again,

00:56:20.461 --> 00:56:22.920 align:middle line:84%
it always comes back to
personal responsibility, right?

00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:25.050 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] There's no
easy one on this one.

00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:27.790 align:middle line:84%
But we do have to take action
in terms of if this is something

00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:30.000 align:middle line:84%
that's appealing, it
sounds like we really need

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.400 align:middle line:84%
to start approaching
the interests that

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:35.210 align:middle line:84%
matter on a local level and then
start taking it up from there.

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:37.180 align:middle line:90%
And we're out of time.

00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:39.410 align:middle line:84%
I so much appreciate
your being here

00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and giving us a
little bit of a better

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.000 align:middle line:84%
understanding of the
complexity of the system

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.001 align:middle line:90%
and how we can fix it.

00:56:45.001 --> 00:56:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWN: Yeah, thanks, Regina.

00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I hope this has
been beneficial in helping

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.630 align:middle line:84%
you understand the
creation of money.

00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And the good news is that new
systems, even new currencies,

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:55.190 align:middle line:84%
are going to be birthed to
help us get back on our feet

00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.996 align:middle line:90%
as a species.

00:56:55.996 --> 00:56:57.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to
take some time.

00:56:57.370 --> 00:56:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you do have
choices as to what

00:56:59.910 --> 00:57:02.506 align:middle line:84%
to do with your money, as
Ellen's just pointed out.

00:57:02.506 --> 00:57:03.630 align:middle line:90%
You have to research a bit.

00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:05.400 align:middle line:84%
We each have to become
our own advocates

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:07.089 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what we
choose to support.

00:57:07.089 --> 00:57:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like it
needs to start politically.

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:11.560 align:middle line:84%
So until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:14.410 align:middle line:90%
on Gaiam TV.

00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:23.534 align:middle line:10%
