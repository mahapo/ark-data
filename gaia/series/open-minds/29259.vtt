00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.820 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
There are certain people

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.400 align:middle line:10%
on this planet who seem to be
exempt from the constraints

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.820 align:middle line:10%
of the rest of us in
terms of their genius.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Their minds appear
to fly unfettered

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.156 align:middle line:84%
into realms of
discovery reserved only

00:00:27.156 --> 00:00:28.780 align:middle line:84%
for those who have
the ability to reach

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.260 align:middle line:90%
beyond the physical world.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:84%
One of these people
is Patrick Flanagan.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Patrick was building Tesla coils
and sophisticated ham radios

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.880 align:middle line:84%
by the age of
eight, a device that

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:84%
allowed the deaf to
hear by 13, and, by 16,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.170 align:middle line:84%
the men in gray suits started
visiting his parents' house

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.590 align:middle line:84%
to procure his patent to his
missile detonation detection

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.350 align:middle line:90%
device.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.880 align:middle line:84%
What's it like being
inside this kind of mind?

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's ask Patrick.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Patrick, you're almost
frightening, you're so smart.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And the nice thing is you
have the ability and the sense

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.154 align:middle line:84%
of humor to bring
it down to our level

00:01:01.154 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:84%
so that you can actually help us
understand some of these things

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.840 align:middle line:84%
I just intro'd to our
audience a moment ago.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to start out with
you have something very unique

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:84%
in that you remember your life
almost from the very beginning.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Your perceptions and
thoughts, and even

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.170 align:middle line:84%
into other lifetimes,
which we'll get into later.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.240 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about when
you were just a little baby

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.710 align:middle line:90%
and realized, I'm back.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PATRICK FLANAGAN: I
remember lying in my crib,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.910 align:middle line:84%
wiggling my toes, looking
at my feet, and going,

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.440 align:middle line:84%
oh no, I have to
grow this body up

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:90%
before I can get started again.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:90%
And so I got started early.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I bet you did.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.395 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when
you got started,

00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:53.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just mentioned
a couple of things.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.050 align:middle line:84%
You were already well into
your years as an inventor

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.350 align:middle line:90%
by the age of eight.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:84%
But what happened even prior
to that, when you were just

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.510 align:middle line:84%
a little kid, three
to five years old?

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.480 align:middle line:90%
What were you doing?

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, when
I was three years old,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.130 align:middle line:84%
my parents bought
a ship's compass

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.280 align:middle line:90%
from a army, war surplus place.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, from a
regular ship., and it

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.870 align:middle line:84%
had all these tiny
little screws.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And they gave it
to me to play with.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.630 align:middle line:90%
And I was sitting on the floor.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking
just for a few minutes,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and when they looked down,
I had all the screws out

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.660 align:middle line:84%
of the compass, and I
had it completely apart,

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and I was trying to put
it back together again.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's
the first sign.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.503 align:middle line:84%
Tinker toys weren't
going to cut it for you.

00:02:36.503 --> 00:02:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: No.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then you
started fooling around

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
with-- when did you start
becoming intrigued with kind

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.670 align:middle line:84%
of mechanical engineering
and electricity?

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Oh wow.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.060 align:middle line:90%
When I was about to seven.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.580 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I remembered
who I was in previous lives.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.840 align:middle line:84%
I came over with
electronic knowledge,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.130 align:middle line:84%
electrical knowledge, and I
started creating these things.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And when I was eight years
old, I was already-- I

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:84%
got my ham radio license,
general class ham radio

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.880 align:middle line:90%
license.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At eight.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah, at eight.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And I built all my
ham radio equipment,

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.590 align:middle line:84%
designed and built it myself
from parts that I scavenged.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.417 align:middle line:90%
And then went on from there.

00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let me
ask you something.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we get
into this delicate area

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.940 align:middle line:84%
of reincarnation
for some people.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.430 align:middle line:84%
For others, like ourselves,
it's just common.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a common part
of our thinking.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.320 align:middle line:84%
But when you were
very little, you

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.710 align:middle line:84%
realized you were the
reincarnation of--

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk about how this
was kind of validated later--

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.870 align:middle line:90%
of Nikola Tesla.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, considering what you were
doing and building Tesla coils.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there's always the
argument about reincarnation.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Is somebody reincarnated
as an entity

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.490 align:middle line:84%
or are they simply able to
tap into and bringing back

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.135 align:middle line:90%
all their knowledge.

00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:02.260 align:middle line:84%
However, whatever a person's
philosophy is on this,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.801 align:middle line:84%
the fact is you had
all the knowledge

00:04:03.801 --> 00:04:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Tesla had and you
came in with it.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: That is true.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.015 align:middle line:84%
I built my first Tesla coil
when I was eight years old.

00:04:12.015 --> 00:04:15.380 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Tesla worked with the
lower frequency range,

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.670 align:middle line:84%
anywhere from 40 kilohertz
to 500 kilohertz.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.760 align:middle line:10%
And I built my first Tesla
coil at 14 megahertz in the ham

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:10%
radio band, and was producing
4-foot lightning bolts

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:10%
at 14 megahertz.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Give us some idea
of what that actually means.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.850 align:middle line:84%
But tell us what it
meant to your neighbors.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well,
what happened is

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.650 align:middle line:84%
that I'd get up in the
morning way early, like 4:00

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.500 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, and I'd turn
on my ham radio equipment

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and I'd communicate with people
all over the world with it

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.120 align:middle line:90%
in the 20 meter band.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the neighbors,
all their alarm clocks

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.970 align:middle line:84%
went off at-- mechanical alarm
clocks started going off.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And one of the neighbors went
to rinse his mouth from the sink

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.800 align:middle line:84%
and he got a 4-inch spark
off the faucet to his mouth.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they knew
who in the neighborhood

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:90%
was doing that.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And they complained
to the authorities,

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.120 align:middle line:84%
and I had to shut down
my Tesla coil antenna.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just
try to imagine what

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.120 align:middle line:84%
was your conversation with all
these people around the world--

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.910 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, these were
adults-- at the age of eight.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.600 align:middle line:84%
What were you talking
to them about?

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well,
first of all, I

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.140 align:middle line:84%
was able to really
modulate my voice.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.170 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't sound like a kid.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:84%
They thought I was maybe
18 years old or something

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.910 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'd just chat about all
kinds of things with them.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was an
awesome experience,

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.660 align:middle line:84%
being able to communicate with
people all over the world.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
the state of ham radio

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.020 align:middle line:90%
technology at the time?

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, were you on
the leading edge?

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Was your device on the leading
edge, is it fair to say?

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Way beyond that.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.870 align:middle line:84%
The people in
Italy, for example,

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.950 align:middle line:84%
told me that my
signal was so strong

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.540 align:middle line:84%
that it was overwhelming
their receiver,

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.570 align:middle line:84%
and that it seemed like I was
next door to them with a 1

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.740 align:middle line:90%
kilowatt transmitter.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I was a third of the
way around the world from them.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And so no, the
technology I developed

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:56.720 align:middle line:84%
is way beyond anything that ham
radio even since has developed.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.684 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you
remembering these things

00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and just kind of building
them from your mind?

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Or because you already knew at
that point of your previous--

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.750 align:middle line:84%
and you had told your
mother, hey, mom,

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I was Nikola Tesla
in my last lifetime.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And you were born 18
months after he died.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Were you going
back trying to find

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.325 align:middle line:84%
any kind of available
diagrams from Tesla's time?

00:07:15.325 --> 00:07:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: No.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or were you
just remembering--

00:07:17.435 --> 00:07:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Absolutely, yeah.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just brought
it all through yourself.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.263 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: I brought
it all through myself.

00:07:22.263 --> 00:07:24.200 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to go
back and research.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.860 align:middle line:90%
I remembered all of it.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can we go back and
speak a little bit about,

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.150 align:middle line:84%
in Tesla's time, what was going
on with the radio technologies?

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.620 align:middle line:84%
What was going on
with Marconi and such,

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:90%
and where Tesla fit into this.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, first of all,
Tesla invented radio, period.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And Marconi, there
was a lawsuit,

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and Tesla won the
lawsuit eventually

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.910 align:middle line:84%
and is declared the
inventor of radio.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.605 align:middle line:84%
But that said,
Marconi is the one

00:07:56.605 --> 00:08:00.350 align:middle line:84%
who first implemented
radio communications,

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and the British post
office picked up on it,

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:84%
and they had radio
communications

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.530 align:middle line:84%
between all the
British post offices.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And you have to understand
that human beings grew up

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:17.510 align:middle line:84%
in a period in which--
let's say all animals

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and all humans lived on
Earth with no radios.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And so when the Marconi
system was implemented,

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.990 align:middle line:84%
what happened is
that people started

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.419 align:middle line:84%
getting sick from
the radio waves.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:38.409 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is that they
began to complain about it,

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:43.010 align:middle line:90%
and they wanted to kill Marconi.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And Marconi had to have a
large contingent of bodyguards

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.750 align:middle line:84%
around him all the
time because of this.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And so now, if you're born
into radio waves, Wi-Fi--

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We've adapted.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: --your body,
you're born into it,

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.810 align:middle line:84%
you live through it,
and then you die.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.010 align:middle line:84%
You never know any
difference, right?

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've never
heard this part.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.572 align:middle line:84%
So if he was the one that
was credited with it,

00:09:10.572 --> 00:09:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and they were trying
to lynch, what

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.110 align:middle line:84%
was happening to Tesla
in the background then?

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, essentially he was
going under the radar, right?

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:18.730 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, he also wasn't

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:90%
honored for that technology.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, that's right.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, Marconi was
an awesome, awesome engineer

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.390 align:middle line:90%
on his own.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have to give
Marconi credit for that.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But basically,
the whole thing is

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:84%
is that radio waves,
Wi-Fi, all these things

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.440 align:middle line:90%
affect us and interfere with us.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have
to do is figure out

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.950 align:middle line:84%
ways of modifying the
effects on the body

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:55.300 align:middle line:84%
so that they don't have
a negative effect on us.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the things
I've been doing this lifetime,

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.950 align:middle line:90%
is working on things like that.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You help create
the very technology that

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.097 align:middle line:84%
was making people ill and
is still affecting us.

00:10:07.097 --> 00:10:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And now you're looking at
modulating, creating something

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:11.840 align:middle line:84%
to modulate, which is only
a natural progression.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sooner or
later, someone was

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.180 align:middle line:84%
going to learn how to
harness this electricity

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.570 align:middle line:90%
and create technology from it.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:24.650 align:middle line:84%
But OK, so Marconi,
after-- let's go

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.310 align:middle line:84%
on a little bit
in this Tesla link

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.090 align:middle line:84%
because the other thing
I found interesting

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:35.040 align:middle line:84%
is what happened when you-- did
you go to the patent office?

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.450 align:middle line:84%
When you tried to gain access
to some of Tesla's papers,

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.820 align:middle line:84%
which upon his death
were spirited away--

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.800 align:middle line:84%
no pun intended-- by
Ralph Bergstresser,

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:84%
who was with the OSS,
which became the CIA.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.490 align:middle line:90%
He had those papers.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Tell us the background of how
you ended up meeting with him

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:90%
and what happened.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:00.010 align:middle line:10%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, I wrote a book
called Pyramid Power, published

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:10%
in January 1973, and
Ralph Bergstresser

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.220 align:middle line:10%
was this guy who had
lectures at his house.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Speakers would come over,
and he'd invite friends over.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd go over and
talk about pyramid power.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And Ralph and I were
talking about Tesla,

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and I said, "You know, I was
Nikola Tesla in my last life."

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Well,"
he said, "guess what?"

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:29.900 align:middle line:90%
I said, "What?"

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.680 align:middle line:84%
He said, "When Tesla
died," he said,

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:39.280 align:middle line:84%
"I was with the first group that
came in and took his papers out

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:84%
of a safe that was
in his hotel room."

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "If you
were Tesla, then you

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.940 align:middle line:84%
would know what
was in that safe."

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Specifically, you
would know about this projected

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.200 align:middle line:84%
energy weapon,
which he developed."

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "What do
you know about that?"

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.324 align:middle line:84%
And I drew him
the diagram of it.

00:12:04.324 --> 00:12:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exact.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Exact diagram.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at
it and said, "OK.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.900 align:middle line:90%
You were Nikola Tesla."

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And so Ralph and I,
we're good friends.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:84%
But they took all the
data out of the safe.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.650 align:middle line:90%
But I know all of it.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I know you do.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:33.950 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's interesting,
too, because at the time,

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:37.034 align:middle line:10%
this whole notion of past
lives and claiming identities

00:12:37.034 --> 00:12:39.450 align:middle line:10%
from the past, especially from
someone that high profile--

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.140 align:middle line:10%
you actually have
kept that to yourself,

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.515 align:middle line:10%
except for a couple of people,
until just the last couple

00:12:43.515 --> 00:12:44.690 align:middle line:10%
of months.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:50.730 align:middle line:10%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, because I
was so destroyed as Tesla.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.600 align:middle line:10%
You have to understand
that they destroyed me.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:02.767 align:middle line:10%
My life was completely
destroyed by them.

00:13:02.767 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It still makes
you very emotional.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.308 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:13:05.308 --> 00:13:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I can see your eyes.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: I had
to keep it secret.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And even this lifetime,
I've been attacked.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: You know.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.827 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've
been through a lot.

00:13:15.827 --> 00:13:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Oh, yeah.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:16.777 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:16.777 --> 00:13:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's very
difficult, I mean,

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:84%
because you've been watched
from such an early age.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.260 align:middle line:84%
You've had your technology
stolen from you,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.480 align:middle line:84%
your patents stolen
from you repeatedly.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.530 align:middle line:84%
So you've had to constantly
reinvent yourself-- again,

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:34.720 align:middle line:84%
no pun intended-- and come
up with new technologies

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.940 align:middle line:84%
so that you could keep
yourself in the world

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.490 align:middle line:90%
and keep offering your services.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And I've read
about Tesla's life,

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, there are
many documentaries out.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.110 align:middle line:84%
If any of you have
not seen or really

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.970 align:middle line:84%
done any research into
Nikola Tesla's life,

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.094 align:middle line:90%
it would be worth doing so.

00:13:51.094 --> 00:13:52.920 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
most fascinating people

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.540 align:middle line:90%
in modern history.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.600 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very sad story.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.430 align:middle line:90%
And he died alone.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:02.240 align:middle line:84%
He died a broken person on a
lot of levels, emotionally.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And so you came into this
lifetime with a lot of trauma

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:06.690 align:middle line:90%
going on in your early life.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:10.500 align:middle line:84%
You kind of came in where
you left off, but with all

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:84%
that knowledge and
genius that you

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:17.830 align:middle line:84%
were able to bring through
and help us now, as a species,

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:18.730 align:middle line:90%
forward ourselves.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to talk
about something you just

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.587 align:middle line:84%
talked about, this
particle-beam weapon.

00:14:25.587 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't planning on going
there, but let's go ahead

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.545 align:middle line:84%
and get into it at
this point before we

00:14:29.545 --> 00:14:30.930 align:middle line:90%
go on the journey of your life.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Sure.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
electricity, while it

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.990 align:middle line:84%
was making people sick, it was
also powering the planet, OK?

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, wait a minute.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.720 align:middle line:84%
I have to say that if they had
implemented my system the way

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.650 align:middle line:84%
I had designed it, it
would not make people sick.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What happened?

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: I used
scalar wave technology.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And the scalar wave
technology that I developed

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.600 align:middle line:90%
would not make people sick.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is
that the 60 hertz power

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:08.180 align:middle line:84%
line, the way it's used and
the way it's transmitted,

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and the way radio waves
have been implemented,

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:19.810 align:middle line:84%
is that the electromagnetic
component is

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:84%
harming people and
making them sick.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.320 align:middle line:84%
But if they had implemented
the way I had done it,

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.240 align:middle line:84%
then it would not
make people sick.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:34.180 align:middle line:84%
But the way it is now, we have
to fix that and correct it.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.450 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Do we have
to essentially get

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.444 align:middle line:10%
rid of the old grid
system that we have

00:15:38.444 --> 00:15:40.110 align:middle line:10%
and create something
entirely different?

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:41.990 align:middle line:10%
Or can you ride a
different kind of frequency

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:45.205 align:middle line:10%
over the existing grid?

00:15:45.205 --> 00:15:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: I actually
have the technology

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:84%
to fix what's
happening right now.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:55.740 align:middle line:84%
We can actually implement
technology right now,

00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:01.570 align:middle line:84%
and heal people, and
protect them from Wi-Fi,

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.037 align:middle line:84%
from everything that's
going on right now.

00:16:04.037 --> 00:16:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, is this something
that is in development?

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't
think I know about

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:84%
this particular
technology just yet.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: I've developed
it in the last six months.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.737 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get to
that a little bit later.

00:16:16.737 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I knew you would have
some kind of surprise,

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.486 align:middle line:84%
and I thought I knew
what you were working on,

00:16:20.486 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:90%
but clearly not.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:26.550 align:middle line:84%
So before we go into that in a
later part of the conversation,

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:30.260 align:middle line:84%
let's go back to what happened
after the eight-year-old

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.890 align:middle line:84%
experiences, and you
are continuing on.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And you ended up
building a device that

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:39.360 align:middle line:84%
allowed those who
are deaf to hear,

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and not through the
normal auditory channels.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:46.210 align:middle line:84%
A, what inspired you to
begin working on this?

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:50.920 align:middle line:84%
B, was that simply an unintended
benefit or consequence?

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.450 align:middle line:90%
What was that all about?

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, when I
was Tesla, one of the things

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.970 align:middle line:84%
that I observed, and
it actually happened,

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:84%
is that if you plugged up your
ears while the Tesla coil was

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.030 align:middle line:84%
operating, you
could actually hear

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.810 align:middle line:84%
the sound inside
your head, as if it

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:14.720 align:middle line:84%
was coming from
inside your head.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.469 align:middle line:84%
And a few deaf people came
into my lab and could hear.

00:17:18.469 --> 00:17:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They could hear what?

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.676 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: The sound.

00:17:20.676 --> 00:17:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just the frequencies?

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:23.274 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: The
sound of the arc.

00:17:23.274 --> 00:17:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The arcing?

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.339 align:middle line:10%
>>FLANAGAN: Yep,
inside their head.

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I observed
that, of course.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And so this lifetime,
what I did is

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:84%
I implemented that
and developed what's

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.440 align:middle line:84%
called the Neurophone
when I was 13 years old.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And I applied for
a patent on it,

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and the patent office
refused to give me

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.340 align:middle line:84%
a patent because they said
it couldn't possibly work.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I eventually went
through this from the age of 13

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:01.280 align:middle line:90%
until I was 19 years old.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And I flew to Washington
with my patent attorney.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.460 align:middle line:84%
By then, I had enough
money to implement that.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Flew to Washington with
the patent attorney.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And the patent office
had a deaf employee

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:84%
who hadn't heard
anything for 13 years.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And they brought
him and they said--

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and I brought my invention
to the patent office.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.530 align:middle line:84%
You see cartoons
about people sitting

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:29.370 align:middle line:84%
in the patent office
with inventions.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, I brought my invention
to the patent office,

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.155 align:middle line:84%
and they brought in
the deaf employee,

00:18:36.155 --> 00:18:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and they said, "If you
can make this man hear

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.260 align:middle line:84%
with your invention, we'll
give you your patent."

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I hooked it up
to him and he heard.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:50.080 align:middle line:84%
They had a Maria Callas record,
which was this famous opera

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.320 align:middle line:90%
singer, multi-range.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And so they brought him
in with a record player.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And they hooked it
up to my Neurophone,

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and I played the Maria
Callas for him and he heard.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And he started crying,
broke down in tears.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And everyone in the
patent office was crying.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.200 align:middle line:90%
And so they gave me my patent.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And so another wonderful
event in my life.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you
specifically looking

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.700 align:middle line:84%
to restore hearing to
those who were deaf?

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: No.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What were
you actually doing

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:90%
where you've bumped into this?

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, the Neurophone
enables-- is way beyond that.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.067 align:middle line:84%
The Neurophone isn't
even for deaf people.

00:19:38.067 --> 00:19:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what I thought.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.920 align:middle line:84%
So when I read that
part of your story,

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I wondered if that was just
an unintended consequence.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: It balances the
left and right hemispheres

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:53.600 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, and
it increases IQ.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:20:03.310 align:middle line:84%
We did a study with a device
called a neural analysis

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:06.120 align:middle line:84%
device that's actually
used at West Point

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:11.150 align:middle line:84%
to measure IQ for
officers candidate school.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Measures the neural
efficiency of the brain.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And basically what we found
out with the Neurophone is

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:23.570 align:middle line:84%
it increases the efficiency
of the brain, increases IQ.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And so it's way beyond
a hearing device.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:33.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my current Neurophones,
in order for deaf people

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.740 align:middle line:84%
to hear with it, it has
to be extremely powerful.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And my current Neurophone
is not that powerful.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.225 align:middle line:84%
But what it does is it increases
the efficiency of the brain

00:20:45.225 --> 00:20:47.510 align:middle line:90%
and increases IQ.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So somehow, the
application for the deaf,

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.677 align:middle line:90%
it was working with what?

00:20:52.677 --> 00:20:56.900 align:middle line:84%
With the electrical system
on some level to stimulate?

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.270 align:middle line:90%
How did it work?

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.255 align:middle line:84%
Well, does anyone even
know how it works?

00:21:00.255 --> 00:21:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Oh, sure.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, how does it work?

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:02.258 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: I do.

00:21:02.258 --> 00:21:05.395 align:middle line:90%


00:21:05.395 --> 00:21:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you could tell
us how did that work.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And again, speaking to
seventh graders here.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Just a little bit
of science on it.

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:15.518 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Sure.

00:21:15.518 --> 00:21:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Well basically, the neural
efficiency analyzer measures--

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:27.340 align:middle line:84%
what happens is that
if you flash a strobe

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:33.660 align:middle line:84%
light in the eyes, the
left eye and the right eye

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:38.010 align:middle line:84%
both send signals to the
visual part of the brain,

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and then you measure the
signal in the brain when

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:49.250 align:middle line:84%
it arrives at the
optical cortex.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:50.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.862 align:middle line:84%
Basically what
happens is that-- that

00:21:52.862 --> 00:21:59.760 align:middle line:84%
if you-- there's a time
delay between the two eyes'

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.180 align:middle line:84%
signal arriving
at the same time.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And the higher the efficiency
of the brain, the shorter

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.050 align:middle line:90%
the time delay.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that if
you increase the efficiency

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:19.990 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, the higher
the IQ, the shorter the time

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:21.975 align:middle line:84%
delay between the
two hemispheres.

00:22:21.975 --> 00:22:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hemispheres, right.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: So what happened is
that the Neurophone increases

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.760 align:middle line:84%
the efficiency of it to
where-- in fact, when my IQ was

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:37.190 align:middle line:84%
measured when I was 14
years old, it was off scale.

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:38.500 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't measure my IQ.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.319 align:middle line:84%
They said it was higher
than any IQ ever measured.

00:22:41.319 --> 00:22:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and you had
been using your own device.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Exactly.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:44.849 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

00:22:44.849 --> 00:22:45.598 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You did.

00:22:45.598 --> 00:22:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And part of it was you didn't
want to waste those hours,

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.306 align:middle line:84%
those downtime
hours of sleeping.

00:22:50.306 --> 00:22:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Didn't you want to try to
increase your efficiency so you

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.185 align:middle line:90%
could learn almost 24/7?

00:22:54.185 --> 00:22:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:22:55.070 --> 00:23:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I was 14, they
measured my reading speed,

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:09.690 align:middle line:84%
and I could read 14,500 words a
minute with 95% comprehension.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but I
have a photographic memory,

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:21.040 align:middle line:84%
so I remember 95% of
everything I read completely.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the Neurophone
is what did that.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I was given
the Neurophone.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.940 align:middle line:84%
See, I don't believe
I invented anything.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.280 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's all given to me.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.655 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is a good time
to explain this part of it.

00:23:34.655 --> 00:23:35.830 align:middle line:90%
Please, take some time.

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.320 align:middle line:84%
We have about four or five
minutes in this segment.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:43.830 align:middle line:10%
>>FLANAGAN: Basically what I was
taught is, I mean, what I feel,

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.380 align:middle line:10%
is that I work
really hard on things

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.850 align:middle line:10%
and I don't get them right.

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.420 align:middle line:10%
And then somebody
feels sorry for me.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.870 align:middle line:10%
And then three days later,
a week later, suddenly I

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:55.000 align:middle line:10%
get a download.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's an instantaneous
download of technology.

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:01.920 align:middle line:84%
It just pours in, and
suddenly, I know everything.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.540 align:middle line:90%
I get circuit diagrams.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.640 align:middle line:90%
I get everything.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.530 align:middle line:90%
I get everything I need.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I build
it and it works.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:14.250 align:middle line:90%
And so that is given to me.

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
who gives it to me,

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:90%
but I'm very thankful for it.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It can happen
when you're awake,

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.362 align:middle line:84%
crossover time, or
dream time, right?

00:24:23.362 --> 00:24:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Absolutely.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the point is that
you are intending an outcome

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:33.430 align:middle line:84%
because you put the struggle
into it in advance by working

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:35.750 align:middle line:84%
out whatever your normal,
our normal-- well,

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.380 align:middle line:84%
your normal faculties
would work through.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's not to a
positive conclusion,

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:90%
you'll still be working at it.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:47.760 align:middle line:84%
So I think you can say when
there's a clear intention,

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.675 align:middle line:90%
help always arrives.

00:24:48.675 --> 00:24:50.920 align:middle line:84%
It's just with you, it
arrives in this way.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Yes, it
does arrive in this way.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Somebody said, well,
Patrick, that's

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:56.790 align:middle line:90%
just how your brain works.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:00.260 align:middle line:84%
You throw everything in, and it
computes and then spits it out.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.270 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
that's the case.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:06.620 align:middle line:84%
I think that somebody up there
loves me and is helping me.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
also more or less

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:10.307 align:middle line:90%
what Tesla felt as well.

00:25:10.307 --> 00:25:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Exactly.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He knew that
there was something

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:14.750 align:middle line:84%
flowing into and
through his mind.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.695 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can almost look at
the mind as just a processing

00:25:17.695 --> 00:25:19.035 align:middle line:90%
unit, really.

00:25:19.035 --> 00:25:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: That's
what it is, yeah.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:21.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:28.480 align:middle line:84%
So you, you got the
patent on the Neurophone.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.970 align:middle line:90%
You started using that.

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Other people started
using it for the purpose

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.780 align:middle line:84%
of being able to
learn continuously,

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.695 align:middle line:90%
even using it in the sleep.

00:25:37.695 --> 00:25:38.820 align:middle line:90%
But there's something else.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I remember there was some kind
of measurement on your brain

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.520 align:middle line:84%
waves, and didn't you have
an exceedingly high gamma,

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.600 align:middle line:84%
which is normally the deepest
state of, like, a Buddhist

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.630 align:middle line:90%
meditation?

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: I went
to the Mayo Clinic

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and lectured when
I was 17 years old,

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:58.100 align:middle line:84%
and Doctor Steve Ferian,
who brought in Swami Rama

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:03.590 align:middle line:84%
from the Himalayas, the first
Himalayan Tibetan Yogi ever

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:04.850 align:middle line:90%
measured.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.780 align:middle line:90%
And he had certain brain waves.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And so when I lectured
at the Mayo Clinic,

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.610 align:middle line:84%
he asked me to come
back into his lab.

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:15.380 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to measure
my brain waves.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.410 align:middle line:84%
So he tested me out, and
he said my brain waves are

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:28.030 align:middle line:84%
identical to Swami Rama's,
and that I was producing alpha

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:33.033 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, beta, alpha,
and delta waves simultaneously.

00:26:33.033 --> 00:26:34.074 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Simultaneously.

00:26:34.074 --> 00:26:35.340 align:middle line:90%
That's not normal.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: And not only
that, but my brain waves

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.240 align:middle line:84%
were off the charts,
that he had to readjust

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:84%
his machine because the
signal was so strong they had

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.970 align:middle line:84%
to turn everything down
because it was about 10

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:51.915 align:middle line:84%
times the normal strength
of ordinary signal.

00:26:51.915 --> 00:26:55.305 align:middle line:90%


00:26:55.305 --> 00:26:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just to explain,
that's not normal.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.890 align:middle line:84%
People don't operate at the same
strength on those frequencies.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Beta, usually
you're in task mode.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:03.930 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking you
questions in beta mode.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Alpha's that wonderful feel
good place that we sink into,

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:11.880 align:middle line:84%
where life is good
and we're in harmony.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And you go into delta, really,
most people are meditating

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.950 align:middle line:84%
and that's like going
into sleep time by then.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: That is correct.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're doing
all of them simultaneously.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
but normally, let's

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.610 align:middle line:84%
say, if you're
producing alpha waves

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:31.374 align:middle line:84%
and you solve a mathematical
equation, you go into beta, OK?

00:27:31.374 --> 00:27:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.873 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: The higher
frequency brainwaves.

00:27:33.873 --> 00:27:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happened with
me is that no matter

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:40.940 align:middle line:84%
what he did, what equations I
did, what mathematics I did,

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.210 align:middle line:84%
I was always
producing alpha waves.

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And always these delta spikes,
which are your normal sleep

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:52.450 align:middle line:84%
waves, which is also
like your healing waves.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And that was going
on all the time.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.050 align:middle line:90%


00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have a lot
more to talk about.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.080 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a little
break, just a couple minutes

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:02.260 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.635 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
come back and talk

00:28:03.635 --> 00:28:09.049 align:middle line:84%
about your nuclear detonation
detection device that really

00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:10.590 align:middle line:84%
started all the
trouble in your life.

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We'll be right back.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:18.180 align:middle line:90%


00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:21.751 align:middle line:84%
We are back, and we have
barely scratched the surface.

00:28:21.751 --> 00:28:23.000 align:middle line:90%
We're still on the Neurophone.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And just a very, very quick
recap on the Neurophone

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:28.890 align:middle line:84%
before I ask you another
question about it,

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:33.120 align:middle line:84%
which is-- so it syncs
up, puts into harmony

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.694 align:middle line:84%
the right and left hemispheres
of the brain, right?

00:28:35.694 --> 00:28:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yes.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:36.901 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:36.901 --> 00:28:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And once that
happens, everything

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.140 align:middle line:84%
becomes more efficient in
terms of our functioning.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Would that include even
our bodies' immune systems,

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:49.630 align:middle line:84%
our senses, not just our
intellectual capacities?

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:50.479 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yes.

00:28:50.479 --> 00:28:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.380 align:middle line:90%
That's the short answer.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.227 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:28:54.227 --> 00:28:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to ask you
to explain the science of it

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.520 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think I
would even understand it.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.130 align:middle line:84%
But I do want to say at this
point people are listening

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:05.260 align:middle line:84%
and probably are, in the
British term, gobsmacked.

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Their mouths are hanging open.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Who is this fellow?

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Why doesn't everyone
know your name?

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.730 align:middle line:90%
Why aren't you a gajilionaire?

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about the gajilions

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.810 align:middle line:90%
of dollars part of it.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:19.700 align:middle line:84%
So in 1962, not surprisingly,
you ended up in "Life Magazine"

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.620 align:middle line:84%
at a very early age as
part of the new brain

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.270 align:middle line:84%
trust of the planet
with your inventions.

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:27.400 align:middle line:84%
The Neurophone was
already well established.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.170 align:middle line:84%
You received an offer to
become, in those days,

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:33.480 align:middle line:84%
what would have been
almost a gajilionaire.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.830 align:middle line:90%
And you were 17 years old.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:36.080 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us what happened?

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.396 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: I was
offered $8 million

00:29:39.396 --> 00:29:42.750 align:middle line:84%
to develop the Neurophone
for deaf people.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that point that
the government put the patent

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:50.080 align:middle line:90%
application under secrecy.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And because it
was under secrecy,

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.940 align:middle line:90%
why that deal fell through.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why was it put
under a secrecy patent?

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: First
of all, they decided

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:10.080 align:middle line:84%
that the Neurophone
might have military uses.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And because it might be
used to program people.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And so the result of that is
that they put it under secrecy,

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and it took what seemed
like forever to get out.

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:31.702 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I received an award
with Doctor Edward Teller.

00:30:31.702 --> 00:30:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
the Golden Plate.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:33.912 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:30:33.912 --> 00:30:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
very prestigious.

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:36.625 align:middle line:90%
Please talk about that.

00:30:36.625 --> 00:30:39.570 align:middle line:90%
That is an amazing achievement.

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: When I was 17, I
received the Gold Plate Award,

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:49.280 align:middle line:84%
which in San Diego--
and we went out there.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And Doctor Edward Teller, who
developed the atomic bomb,

00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and the director of the
CIA, Admiral Red Raborn,

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:02.870 align:middle line:84%
who developed the
Polaris submarine,

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:08.270 align:middle line:84%
and I were all receiving
the same award together.

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.270 align:middle line:84%
So we're all sitting
around the same table.

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And Murray Gell-Mann, who
developed the technology

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:20.170 align:middle line:90%
for DNA replication of viruses.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:22.631 align:middle line:84%
And we're all getting
the same award together.

00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When I
look at that, I see

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:25.820 align:middle line:84%
a comedy where they
have a line-up.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.796 align:middle line:84%
And they're panning across
the faces of the dignitaries

00:31:28.796 --> 00:31:29.920 align:middle line:90%
and there's the blank spot.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.692 align:middle line:84%
And they go down here
and there's Patrick.

00:31:31.692 --> 00:31:32.525 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Exactly.

00:31:32.525 --> 00:31:33.691 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And back up again.

00:31:33.691 --> 00:31:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Exactly.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.605 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well now,
that's some fine company.

00:31:37.605 --> 00:31:39.521 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
prestigious company.

00:31:39.521 --> 00:31:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: It is.

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:41.728 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, the
Neurophone, they

00:31:41.728 --> 00:31:43.400 align:middle line:84%
said that they had
to sequester this

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.860 align:middle line:84%
because it had potentials
to program brains.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So the director of
the CIA, who later

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.550 align:middle line:84%
became director of
the NSA, Admiral

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Red Raborn, he said, "Son, we
want to give you a scholarship

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:03.622 align:middle line:84%
to go to as many colleges and
universities in the world.

00:32:03.622 --> 00:32:04.830 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about getting in.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:06.060 align:middle line:90%
We'll get you in.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Study as much as you want.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And when you
graduate, we want you

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.670 align:middle line:84%
to work for the
CIA for five years,

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:16.060 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll let you go and
you do what you wanted to do."

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And by then, I
was making-- 17, I

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.800 align:middle line:84%
was making more
money than my father.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.340 align:middle line:90%
And so I didn't need the money.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.960 align:middle line:90%
And so I said no thanks.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.926 align:middle line:90%


00:32:28.926 --> 00:32:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't understand
the implications of that.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:32.633 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, I kind of did.

00:32:32.633 --> 00:32:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Somebody said if you
go to work for them,

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.390 align:middle line:90%
they'll never let you go.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no
way they're going

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.810 align:middle line:90%
to let you go in five years.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:47.100 align:middle line:84%
But what happened is
that Red Raborn, then,

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Admiral Raborn said, "Well,
I'll tell you what, son."

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:56.080 align:middle line:84%
He said, "How about we
do a favors program?"

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.720 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "What's that?"

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "You need us to do
something for you, we'll do it.

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:05.420 align:middle line:90%
But then you owe me a favor.

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you do
something for me.

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:11.000 align:middle line:90%
And so we'll work on favors."

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "You call the CIA
and you leave a message for me,

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and I'll call you
back within 24 hours."

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm having
trouble with my patent,

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and I called the
CIA, and this voice

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:27.490 align:middle line:84%
sounded like it was
from the deep hole.

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And the voice said,
"What can I do for you?"

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "I want to leave
a message for Red Raborn."

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Never heard of him.

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, "He was
director of the CIA."

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.110 align:middle line:90%
Still never heard of him.

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:46.010 align:middle line:84%
I said, "OK, well he told me
I could leave a message here

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:47.862 align:middle line:90%
and he'd call me back."

00:33:47.862 --> 00:33:52.280 align:middle line:84%
The voice said, "You could
leave a message for anyone here.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.320 align:middle line:84%
I just can't guarantee you
that they'll call you back."

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.710 align:middle line:90%
I said, "OK."

00:33:56.710 --> 00:34:02.650 align:middle line:84%
So I left a message, and
Raborn called me back.

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.230 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "OK, here.

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:08.215 align:middle line:84%
I got my patent in this thing
here and I want it back."

00:34:08.215 --> 00:34:10.000 align:middle line:90%
He said, "OK, no problem."

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.056 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I'll get
it back for you."

00:34:12.056 --> 00:34:13.389 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Neurophone patent.

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: My
Neurophone patent.

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:16.409 align:middle line:90%
He got it back.

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, "Now I
want a favor from you."

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.770 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "OK.

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:21.420 align:middle line:90%
What's that?"

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Among many favors, he wanted a
high-security speech scrambler

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:31.890 align:middle line:84%
because the Russians
were decoding everything

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:34.630 align:middle line:90%
that they were transmitting.

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:37.510 align:middle line:84%
So I designed and gave
them the technology

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:42.639 align:middle line:84%
for a high-security scrambler
that nobody could decode.

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:44.684 align:middle line:84%
The Russians, nobody
could decode it.

00:34:44.684 --> 00:34:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now at what
age are you at this point?

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:50.000 align:middle line:90%


00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.959 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: 20.

00:34:50.959 --> 00:34:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: About 20.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:52.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:54.386 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: About 19.

00:34:54.386 --> 00:34:56.719 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By this time, you've
almost reached adulthood.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.890 align:middle line:90%
Almost.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:58.940 align:middle line:90%
I am now.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:02.440 align:middle line:90%


00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.670 align:middle line:90%
So I did that.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And like I say, we did a
program of favors for each other

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:08.545 align:middle line:90%
and it worked out really well.

00:35:08.545 --> 00:35:11.820 align:middle line:90%


00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.227 align:middle line:90%
Favors aren't a bad thing.

00:35:13.227 --> 00:35:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, not a bad thing.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.904 align:middle line:84%
And so you got your
Neurophone back.

00:35:16.904 --> 00:35:17.570 align:middle line:90%
They said that--

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:18.255 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Oh.

00:35:18.255 --> 00:35:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah?

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.576 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: I'm sorry.

00:35:19.576 --> 00:35:22.080 align:middle line:84%
But when he gave
me my patent back,

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.590 align:middle line:84%
he didn't tell me
they were going

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:25.680 align:middle line:90%
to let me do anything with it.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And then they spent all
these years keeping me

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.810 align:middle line:84%
from putting it on the
market, and sabotaging me,

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:35.400 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just because
I got it back

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:38.720 align:middle line:90%
didn't mean I could do anything.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.775 align:middle line:90%


00:35:40.775 --> 00:35:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what
they said, that it

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.506 align:middle line:84%
had the potential
to program minds.

00:35:45.506 --> 00:35:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, A, I would
think that's something

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:48.830 align:middle line:84%
they would have been very
interested in, knowing

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:50.371 align:middle line:84%
about some of the
black ops projects,

00:35:50.371 --> 00:35:53.310 align:middle line:84%
and it probably
was used that way.

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:53.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:56.202 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
money they offered you.

00:35:56.202 --> 00:35:57.660 align:middle line:84%
What happened when
they offered you

00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:01.280 align:middle line:84%
all that money for your
device and the patent on it?

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.595 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, what happened
is because my patent was--

00:36:04.595 --> 00:36:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it was hung
up under the secrecy, yeah.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: --hung up,
I couldn't get it back.

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:11.040 align:middle line:90%
So that offer faded away.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So that faded away.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.545 align:middle line:84%
I want to get on to the
science fair in Houston

00:36:16.545 --> 00:36:17.700 align:middle line:90%
and what happened.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Now this is prior.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:19.080 align:middle line:84%
We're going back in
time a little bit.

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:19.954 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah, OK.

00:36:19.954 --> 00:36:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you've already
put the Neurophone out there

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:22.961 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:36:22.961 --> 00:36:24.960 align:middle line:90%
It's gained a lot of attention.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a science
fair in Houston.

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:32.500 align:middle line:90%
And what in the world made you--

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: I'm 12 years old.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What made
you create this--

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.190 align:middle line:84%
it's a nuclear detonation
detection device.

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:41.120 align:middle line:90%
Why did you do that?

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.430 align:middle line:84%
A. And then tell
us what you did.

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: We moved to
Houston from Montana.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.510 align:middle line:84%
My father was an oil scout
for Shell Oil Company,

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and we moved to Houston
three months before.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And they said there's
this big science fair.

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:58.580 align:middle line:84%
All grades, college
all the way down.

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And if any of you have a science
fair project you'd like to do.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So I thought about it and
I built the guided missile

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:09.341 align:middle line:84%
detector, which I had
in mind all this time.

00:37:09.341 --> 00:37:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All this time?

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:10.870 align:middle line:90%
You were 12.

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:13.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how long had you
been thinking that one over?

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:14.502 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Maybe a year.

00:37:14.502 --> 00:37:15.326 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:37:15.326 --> 00:37:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: And so
I built this device,

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:26.070 align:middle line:84%
and I was detecting all the
missile firings, ICBM firings

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:29.060 align:middle line:84%
and the nuclear detonations
all over the world.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And I made a list of them,
when they went off, and where,

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:36.620 align:middle line:84%
because I could pinpoint
where they went off, too.

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And I won the
entire science fair.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.970 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing.

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm sitting
in class on Monday

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.304 align:middle line:90%
and principal comes on the--

00:37:49.304 --> 00:37:50.345 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Speaker system?

00:37:50.345 --> 00:37:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: On
the speaker system

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and says, "Will Patrick Flanagan
come to my office immediately?

00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:08.170 align:middle line:84%
The Pentagon is
on the telephone."

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:12.810 align:middle line:84%
So I go into his office
and a five star general

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:15.470 align:middle line:84%
from the Pentagon's on,
and he says, "Son, we

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:17.290 align:middle line:84%
want to know how you
know all our secrets."

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well, I did it
with my little guided missile

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:21.860 align:middle line:90%
detector."

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And so they sent a
whole team of scientists

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.670 align:middle line:84%
down from Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:32.030 align:middle line:90%
and they took my device away.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:36.907 align:middle line:84%
And they told me, promised me
I could become an astronaut.

00:38:36.907 --> 00:38:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They dangled
that in front of you.

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:39.645 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah, in return.

00:38:39.645 --> 00:38:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In return for
taking your technology.

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:42.078 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:38:42.078 --> 00:38:44.820 align:middle line:90%


00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:49.190 align:middle line:90%
So I worked with them.

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:52.456 align:middle line:84%
But then they really
had their eye on me.

00:38:52.456 --> 00:38:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And they kept their
eye on me my whole life

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and made my life one living
hell for some things.

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:08.346 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, the end result
was that-- a lot of intrigue

00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:08.845 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:39:08.845 --> 00:39:12.597 align:middle line:90%


00:39:12.597 --> 00:39:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was there
a reason you built

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.270 align:middle line:90%
that device to begin with?

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:17.686 align:middle line:84%
I'm always wondering why did
you put your time and energy?

00:39:17.686 --> 00:39:20.390 align:middle line:90%
Why were you curious about it?

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well,
I had this idea,

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:25.410 align:middle line:84%
you know, a vertical
antenna and radio.

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:28.660 align:middle line:84%
What happened is that when
an atomic bomb goes off,

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:31.310 align:middle line:84%
it creates an ionized
gas plume that

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:33.530 align:middle line:84%
goes straight up
into the heavens,

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:37.490 align:middle line:90%
and as super ionized gas plasma.

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And these plasmas
are oscillating.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's got all
these minerals in it

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:45.910 align:middle line:84%
and they're all transmitting
energy frequencies.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:50.322 align:middle line:84%
And so I developed a device that
would detect those frequencies.

00:39:50.322 --> 00:39:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But why?

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.269 align:middle line:84%
You just wanted to know
what was happening?

00:39:54.269 --> 00:39:55.560 align:middle line:90%
Or why did you decide to do it?

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.834 align:middle line:84%
What was your impetus
for it to begin with?

00:39:58.834 --> 00:40:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah,
I wanted to know

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:01.900 align:middle line:84%
when they were firing
these things off.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, great.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:03.360 align:middle line:90%
You just wanted to know.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:04.191 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:04.191 --> 00:40:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: And the same
thing with an ICBM missile.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.560 align:middle line:84%
When it takes off, it
does the same thing.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Only the signature of the
two plasmas are different,

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:15.510 align:middle line:84%
so you can tell the difference
between an atomic bomb

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:18.180 align:middle line:90%
and an ICBM missile.

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:23.465 align:middle line:84%
And so you can detect instantly
when any kind of missile

00:40:23.465 --> 00:40:27.850 align:middle line:90%
is fired using this technology.

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:34.719 align:middle line:84%
And so I detected it
and the rest is history.

00:40:34.719 --> 00:40:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they came
and they took your device.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I talked to
you several years ago,

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:42.782 align:middle line:84%
and I thought I
heard you say back

00:40:42.782 --> 00:40:44.990 align:middle line:84%
then that you were on the
verge of having them return

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:47.290 align:middle line:84%
the patent to you or
something like that.

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:48.120 align:middle line:90%
Did I mishear you?

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.870 align:middle line:90%
It was a casual conversation.

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:52.686 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever get
the patent back?

00:40:52.686 --> 00:40:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Oh, yeah.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.976 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You got
the patent back,

00:40:54.976 --> 00:40:57.060 align:middle line:84%
but they meanwhile
developed that technology

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:57.880 align:middle line:90%
and utilized it.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.755 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Oh, yeah.

00:40:58.755 --> 00:41:01.240 align:middle line:84%
No, they're using
that technology

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.060 align:middle line:90%
for mind programming.

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:04.740 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, wait a minute.

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.550 align:middle line:90%
That's the Neurophone.

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: The Neurophone.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Neurophone.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: You're
talking about--

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The nuclear
detection device.

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.018 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: No, no, no.

00:41:11.018 --> 00:41:12.610 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it
wasn't patented.

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:12.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: I didn't
apply for a patent.

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:15.080 align:middle line:90%
I was 12 years old.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were 12.

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:16.960 align:middle line:90%
So they got that one.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.025 align:middle line:84%
And then they kept the
Neurophone away from you

00:41:19.025 --> 00:41:19.525 align:middle line:90%
for awhile.

00:41:19.525 --> 00:41:20.233 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:41:20.233 --> 00:41:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.810 align:middle line:84%
That is part of what
we call, some people

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:28.202 align:middle line:84%
refer to it as the MKUltra mind
control programs and so forth.

00:41:28.202 --> 00:41:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Absolutely.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Neurophone
is used as part

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:33.954 align:middle line:84%
of the conditioning
of the people.

00:41:33.954 --> 00:41:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yes.

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of the sleepers,
whatever you want to call them.

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yes.

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:42.030 align:middle line:90%
It can also be used to fix it.

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:48.150 align:middle line:84%
That's the double-edged
sword of the Neurophone.

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:49.740 align:middle line:90%
It can be used to program.

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.950 align:middle line:84%
It can be used to
repair a programming.

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's say, let's
take a normal person that

00:41:56.070 --> 00:42:01.100 align:middle line:84%
has just your usual maybe
unproductive mental programming

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:01.870 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe your mind is
going in certain loops.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.360 align:middle line:84%
It's patterned itself
toward a certain loop

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.350 align:middle line:84%
of thinking or
something negative.

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:11.950 align:middle line:84%
The Neurophone, do you have to
have a specific audio program

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:13.190 align:middle line:90%
or intention with it?

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Or does it in and of itself
start rebalancing the brain

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:17.370 align:middle line:90%
so that that disappears?

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:18.470 align:middle line:90%
How's that work?

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: The Neurophone
in and of itself

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.800 align:middle line:90%
balances the brain.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.420 align:middle line:90%


00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:29.790 align:middle line:84%
That said, there are audio
frequencies and signals

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:33.140 align:middle line:84%
that we can put in
to increase that.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:36.245 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How does this dovetail
with Monroe's technology

00:42:36.245 --> 00:42:37.970 align:middle line:90%
and Hemi-Sync?

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Bob Monroe was a
good friend of mine for years.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
with Hemi-Sync is

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:48.789 align:middle line:84%
that it actually throws
the brain out of balance.

00:42:48.789 --> 00:42:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:51.585 align:middle line:90%
So how is that?

00:42:51.585 --> 00:42:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: You know,
it's interesting

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:56.790 align:middle line:84%
that Bob on one hand says
that if a person can only

00:42:56.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:middle line:84%
hear in one ear, and you pulse
the one ear with the Hemi-Sync

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:04.890 align:middle line:84%
frequency, just one ear,
that it entrains the brain.

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And yet, but when you have two
different frequencies coming

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.210 align:middle line:84%
in both ears, what
happens is that it

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:15.470 align:middle line:90%
throws the brain out of balance.

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And so Hemi-Sync would be fixed
if he just combined the signals

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:25.470 align:middle line:84%
together and put the same signal
exactly the same in both ears.

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:28.370 align:middle line:84%
You get the same
thing, but better

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:30.274 align:middle line:84%
because it's now
balancing the brain.

00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:33.480 align:middle line:84%
So is it like a binaural
beat of some kind?

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Instead
of the binaural beat,

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:40.510 align:middle line:84%
you combine the two channels
together and beat both ears

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:42.590 align:middle line:84%
with the same sound
instead of one

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:44.440 align:middle line:90%
in one ear, one in the other.

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I have a few Hemi-Sync CDs.

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:49.650 align:middle line:90%
They're fun to listen to.

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:52.020 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I could be
putting myself a little bit out

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:52.822 align:middle line:84%
of balance, is
what you're saying.

00:43:52.822 --> 00:43:52.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:53.973 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, they do.

00:43:53.973 --> 00:43:56.450 align:middle line:84%
What they do is they
throw the two brain

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:58.869 align:middle line:90%
hemispheres out of balance.

00:43:58.869 --> 00:43:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:00.868 align:middle line:84%
Just for a point
of clarity, I just

00:44:00.868 --> 00:44:02.380 align:middle line:84%
wanted to know
your take on that.

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:03.088 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:44:03.088 --> 00:44:04.350 align:middle line:90%
And you can fix it.

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: All you do is
take the Hemi-Sync signal

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.100 align:middle line:84%
and you combine the
two channels into one

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.740 align:middle line:84%
and then feed it
into your system.

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Into both
ears simultaneously.

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah, both
ears simultaneously.

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:17.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:18.250 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:19.624 align:middle line:84%
Well, I just wanted
to know that.

00:44:19.624 --> 00:44:20.730 align:middle line:90%
Now, what happened?

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:22.890 align:middle line:84%
You're on the cover
of a couple magazines.

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Did you also have "Time" do an
article on you at one point?

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:30.040 align:middle line:84%
"Time" magazine did
an article on me.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're in
your 20s at this point.

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:32.676 align:middle line:10%
>>FLANAGAN: Yes.

00:44:32.676 --> 00:44:35.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And now you've
written the book Pyramid Power.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're going, we're moving
through your detection device.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.640 align:middle line:84%
We're moving through
the Neurophone.

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Now how did you end up sharing
the secrets of the functions

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:48.110 align:middle line:84%
of pyramids with the public
in your book Pyramid Power?

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:50.370 align:middle line:84%
The New Millennium Science,
I think, is the subtitle.

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well,
that was a later copy.

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:57.320 align:middle line:90%
Just Pyramid Power.

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:58.322 align:middle line:90%
It was Pyramid Power.

00:44:58.322 --> 00:44:58.905 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 1973

00:44:58.905 --> 00:44:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: 1973.

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Almost 40 years ago.

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Right.

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:08.740 align:middle line:90%
And so Pyramid Power.

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:11.510 align:middle line:84%
What I did is I
began researching

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:15.190 align:middle line:84%
orgone energy, Wilhelm
Riech's orgone energy,

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:18.530 align:middle line:84%
and I did a lot of
research on that.

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And then I read a bunch
of stuff on pyramids.

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So I built the
pyramids and developed

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:30.360 align:middle line:84%
some different pyramids, orgone
pyramids and things like that,

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.290 align:middle line:90%
and developed this further.

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:35.300 align:middle line:90%
And really, really got into it.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:37.200 align:middle line:90%
So I published Pyramid Power.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, no
one would publish it.

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.660 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get a book
company to publish it.

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So I borrowed $5,000 and I
published it, self-publishing.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And it became an
international bestseller hit.

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:56.959 align:middle line:84%
And I sold 1 and 1/2
million copies of it.

00:45:56.959 --> 00:45:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's amazing.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you would think
that just now, we're

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:02.750 align:middle line:84%
looking at people in the New
Age movement the last 20 years.

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:04.870 align:middle line:84%
But actually, 40
years ago, some people

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:07.450 align:middle line:84%
even say your book
helped kick off

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:09.673 align:middle line:84%
that whole realm
of new thinking.

00:46:09.673 --> 00:46:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.895 align:middle line:84%
My son says I
started the New Age.

00:46:13.895 --> 00:46:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For
better or for worse.

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah, for
better or for worse.

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we'll talk
about this a little bit more

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.040 align:middle line:90%
in detail in a bit.

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:28.880 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, I remember
having a copy of the book years

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.020 align:middle line:90%
ago and trying to read it.

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.395 align:middle line:84%
It was hard for
me to understand.

00:46:32.395 --> 00:46:34.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a lot
of science and math,

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.040 align:middle line:84%
and to the point
where I was really

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:38.705 align:middle line:84%
having to stretch
myself to understand

00:46:38.705 --> 00:46:39.580 align:middle line:90%
what you were saying.

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So maybe, again, speaking
to a seventh grader,

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:45.970 align:middle line:84%
what were you showing
us in that book?

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:48.720 align:middle line:90%


00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: The rooms we're
in, the chambers we're in,

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:55.510 align:middle line:90%
all have resonance.

00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:59.040 align:middle line:84%
If you take a room as a length,
a width, and a height, okay,

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:02.576 align:middle line:84%
and if you take the
length of the room,

00:47:02.576 --> 00:47:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and the width, and
the height, they're

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:10.115 align:middle line:84%
three different measurements and
therefore three different tones

00:47:10.115 --> 00:47:14.670 align:middle line:84%
that they're resonant to, so
they form a three note chord.

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And some three note
chords sound harmonious.

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, if you
bring them into the level

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.912 align:middle line:84%
where you can hear
them, are disharmonious.

00:47:23.912 --> 00:47:25.745 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so just
a mathematical ratio--

00:47:25.745 --> 00:47:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: It's a
mathematical ratio.

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --reflected in sound.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:28.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Exactly.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And so basically
what we want to do

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:34.430 align:middle line:84%
is we want to make sure
the environment we're

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:38.170 align:middle line:84%
in and the rooms
we're in resonate

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:40.920 align:middle line:84%
at frequencies that
are harmonious,

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:45.072 align:middle line:84%
other than the sound of
fingernails on a blackboard.

00:47:45.072 --> 00:47:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in a normal
room, if you were just

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:50.490 align:middle line:84%
in a normal rectangular
box or a square room,

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:52.237 align:middle line:90%
what is that often resonating?

00:47:52.237 --> 00:47:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Depends on the
dimensions of the room.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Depends on
the exact dimensions.

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:56.112 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:56.112 --> 00:47:56.534 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:47:56.534 --> 00:47:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Literally.

00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Le Corbusier and
Frank Lloyd Wright knew this.

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And they built their rooms
so that they actually

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:10.190 align:middle line:84%
would take musical
strings-- you know,

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:12.510 align:middle line:84%
the length, width,
and height of rooms--

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and they would twang
them at the same time

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:20.760 align:middle line:90%
and listen to the sound to see.

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:23.150 align:middle line:84%
They might make them
shorter so that they

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:25.410 align:middle line:84%
were in our normal
hearing range.

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:27.500 align:middle line:84%
But then they would
listen to the rooms

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and they would adjust
them so that they

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:31.029 align:middle line:90%
produced a harmonious sound.

00:48:31.029 --> 00:48:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:32.840 align:middle line:90%
What about Steiner?

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:35.300 align:middle line:84%
What about the whole
notion of Rudolf Steiner's

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.130 align:middle line:84%
work where he didn't
believe in right angles?

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to the point where
paper corners are cut off

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:44.022 align:middle line:84%
in the early grades of the
Steiner education in school.

00:48:44.022 --> 00:48:46.820 align:middle line:84%
All their schools, then,
having no right angles and lots

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:48.440 align:middle line:90%
of rounded and vaulted spaces.

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Steiner was awesome.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.035 align:middle line:84%
Right angle corners
produce discordant energy,

00:48:57.035 --> 00:48:58.910 align:middle line:84%
you know, everywhere
you have the right angle

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:01.910 align:middle line:90%
corners in rooms.

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Way back, I built triangles
that go in the corners.

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:08.110 align:middle line:90%
They round the corners off.

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And I used to sell them
years back in the '70s.

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you could
place them in there

00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and it would essentially
erase the effect

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:18.082 align:middle line:84%
of that discordant
energy in that room.

00:49:18.082 --> 00:49:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:19.706 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:49:19.706 --> 00:49:21.957 align:middle line:84%
So you can ameliorate these
things through technology.

00:49:21.957 --> 00:49:24.247 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not like you
have to have your house razed

00:49:24.247 --> 00:49:25.210 align:middle line:90%
and start over again.

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:25.402 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: That's right.

00:49:25.402 --> 00:49:26.580 align:middle line:90%
You don't.

00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if we were
looking at, say, dome shapes.

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:33.690 align:middle line:84%
You know how the old
cathedrals and often

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:35.090 align:middle line:90%
the vestibule or the foyer--

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:35.756 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yes.

00:49:35.756 --> 00:49:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And cathedrals, you
would have these domes.

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Even Thomas Jefferson's
home and such.

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:44.900 align:middle line:84%
What is the frequency of
being under a domed space

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:46.770 align:middle line:90%
versus these right angles.

00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Depends on the dome.

00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:50.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some domes are
really disharmonious.

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:51.065 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:49:51.065 --> 00:49:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: And
other domes are not.

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does the pitch
matters, for example?

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: The
angle of it, and it

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:58.580 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't be an exact
half-hemisphere.

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:01.776 align:middle line:84%
Half-hemisphere
domes are harmful.

00:50:01.776 --> 00:50:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mean like if
it's literally half of a ball.

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: If it's literally
half of a sphere, it's harmful.

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:15.320 align:middle line:84%
But if you go up a little
bit and it's more than that.

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Little higher.

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: 5/8 of a
sphere, it's better.

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's lower than that,
3/8 of a sphere, it's better.

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's so
interesting, yeah.

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.195 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: But pyramids
actually resonate

00:50:28.195 --> 00:50:30.520 align:middle line:90%
at golden ratio frequencies.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.370 align:middle line:84%
The angle of the
pyramid-- depends

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:36.230 align:middle line:84%
on the angle of the pyramid--
can resonate at energies that

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:39.680 align:middle line:84%
are extremely beneficial
to the human body.

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
going into that.

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:45.960 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at-- what
is the ratio of that?

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:48.030 align:middle line:90%
What is the angle?

00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: The angle of the
pyramid is golden ratio angle,

00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:57.820 align:middle line:90%
and it's about 51.4 degrees.

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And in Russia, they've built
pyramids that are still

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:07.100 align:middle line:84%
using golden ratio angles,
but they're very steep.

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't have to
be at that exact angle.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:14.600 align:middle line:84%
But there are other angles
that match the golden ratio.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's say you
have built your pyramid house

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and you're living within
a pyramidal frequency.

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:23.920 align:middle line:90%
A, is that a smart thing to do?

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Should it even be used to
such a thing to dwell in?

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Or is it a thing to
be utilized maybe

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:31.680 align:middle line:84%
for charging, healing,
or doing other things?

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.135 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: All of the above.

00:51:33.135 --> 00:51:33.676 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:33.676 --> 00:51:36.005 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yep.

00:51:36.005 --> 00:51:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now,
you've spent a lot

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:39.640 align:middle line:84%
of time going back
and forth to Egypt.

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Three years of
your life in total.

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:43.410 align:middle line:90%
You really wanted to--

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Actually,
I lived in Egypt.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you use total time
in Egypt was 3 and 1/2 years.

00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:53.119 align:middle line:90%
And I've been to Egypt 34 times.

00:51:53.119 --> 00:51:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've been
in the Great Pyramid.

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: I've spent the
night in the Great Pyramid

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:59.190 align:middle line:90%
multiple times.

00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And the Great Pyramid,
Egypt-- I mean,

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:09.850 align:middle line:84%
the angles of the Great
Pyramid are ideal.

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:13.370 align:middle line:84%
But you could have
steeper pyramids.

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:17.930 align:middle line:84%
In fact, throughout Africa there
are pyramids going way back

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:22.680 align:middle line:84%
before Egypt, even,
that had steeper angles.

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:26.732 align:middle line:84%
And they're all made at
the right frequencies.

00:52:26.732 --> 00:52:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what did you notice
when you were inside them?

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Spending time
inside the pyramids

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:33.435 align:middle line:84%
when you're inside this
particular geometric ratio?

00:52:33.435 --> 00:52:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Oh my god.

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happens
to mind, the body?

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.970 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, first of all,
I had pyramids over my bed.

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And I sold pyramids
for people to sleep in

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:49.143 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:52:49.143 --> 00:52:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And I spent a huge amount
of time in pyramids.

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
is that I had a cat.

00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Her name was Serafina.

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:03.036 align:middle line:90%
And she lived 23 years.

00:53:03.036 --> 00:53:04.661 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She slept
on the bed with you

00:53:04.661 --> 00:53:05.927 align:middle line:90%
at night under the pyramid?

00:53:05.927 --> 00:53:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Exactly.

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Slept under the pyramid.

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:10.954 align:middle line:90%
And she became a vegetarian cat.

00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah,
because the pyramid.

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And also, she wouldn't
attack animals.

00:53:16.350 --> 00:53:17.840 align:middle line:90%
She left birds alone.

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:21.900 align:middle line:90%
She left squirrels, you name it.

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:24.280 align:middle line:84%
She'd lie there and
birds would walk right

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.230 align:middle line:90%
in front of her nose.

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And she'd just lay
there and watch them.

00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
created some kind

00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:33.930 align:middle line:84%
of peacefulness or coherence
in her being that took away

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:36.245 align:middle line:84%
the normal animal
instinct to kill.

00:53:36.245 --> 00:53:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: It did.

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Would you extend
that to human beings

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:41.700 align:middle line:84%
if we were living in that
kind of refined field?

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:42.533 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: I would.

00:53:42.533 --> 00:53:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I would extend that
to human beings.

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:46.870 align:middle line:84%
If we lived in the
right architecture,

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:49.990 align:middle line:84%
no one would want to fight
each other or harm each other.

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:53.680 align:middle line:90%


00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
really profound.

00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: It is.

00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:00.367 align:middle line:84%
And so now what's
happening is pyramids

00:54:00.367 --> 00:54:01.325 align:middle line:90%
are being rediscovered.

00:54:01.325 --> 00:54:05.970 align:middle line:84%
I was just in Bosnia with Samir
and the Bosnian pyramid, which

00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:09.090 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of anomalies,
a lot of anomalies.

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, from negative
ions in the tunneling,

00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:13.390 align:middle line:84%
to the energy coming
out of the top,

00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:16.500 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that it
was somehow filled in.

00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:19.660 align:middle line:84%
All the tunneling system was
filled in a few to several

00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:21.270 align:middle line:90%
thousand years ago now.

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we have
them in Africa, we

00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:24.980 align:middle line:84%
have them in China,
South America.

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Egypt's only the
tip of the iceberg.

00:54:26.810 --> 00:54:29.855 align:middle line:84%
That was just to catch our
attention, I would assume.

00:54:29.855 --> 00:54:30.813 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Absolutely.

00:54:30.813 --> 00:54:33.940 align:middle line:90%


00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids were built
in the ancient world

00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:37.300 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And even the pyramids
in South America,

00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:44.500 align:middle line:84%
even though they're
at different angles,

00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:49.030 align:middle line:84%
they're all-- angles
are all golden ratio.

00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:52.690 align:middle line:84%
They're all designed to
resonate with each other.

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And my
understanding, too,

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:56.520 align:middle line:84%
is that depending
on whether it's

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.550 align:middle line:84%
a ziggurat or a
smooth-sided pyramid,

00:54:58.550 --> 00:55:00.926 align:middle line:84%
it has a very
different function.

00:55:00.926 --> 00:55:03.665 align:middle line:84%
Is that-- have you paid any
attention or spent any time on

00:55:03.665 --> 00:55:04.165 align:middle line:90%
that?

00:55:04.165 --> 00:55:04.956 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: I have.

00:55:04.956 --> 00:55:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm sure
you've paid attention.

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:08.900 align:middle line:90%
That sly little look, I guess.

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.730 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to say about that?

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:13.810 align:middle line:84%
We only have a couple
minutes left, by the way.

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:16.796 align:middle line:84%
Let's see, I have 26
questions, and that's not

00:55:16.796 --> 00:55:17.790 align:middle line:90%
the sub-questions.

00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:21.334 align:middle line:84%
And I think we made
it to 11 or 12.

00:55:21.334 --> 00:55:23.500 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to have to
have another conversation.

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.340 align:middle line:84%
But just to kind
of wrap on that.

00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Again, the point of writing
that book was to let us

00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:32.770 align:middle line:84%
know about, to make us aware
of space we're in, but also,

00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:36.560 align:middle line:84%
what about specific applications
of the pyramid in modern times

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.640 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Pyramids can
be used for so many things.

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:45.370 align:middle line:84%
We had a lady in Tucson
who built pyramids and was

00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:53.780 align:middle line:84%
developing and building a
food system where she would

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:56.290 align:middle line:84%
dry foods and
vegetables in a pyramid.

00:55:56.290 --> 00:56:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And ants and other cockroaches
wouldn't go in the pyramids.

00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:02.650 align:middle line:90%
And she dried food in there.

00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:06.335 align:middle line:84%
And normally, dried foods
last only a few years

00:56:06.335 --> 00:56:08.290 align:middle line:90%
and you have to throw them away.

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:12.400 align:middle line:84%
They tested her food and
said it would last 30 years.

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now that's why the
seeds and such were found

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:18.019 align:middle line:84%
in pyramids, in chambers, and
in little pots in pyramids.

00:56:18.019 --> 00:56:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: That's right.

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.518 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
makes perfect sense.

00:56:20.518 --> 00:56:21.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, Patrick.

00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:22.630 align:middle line:90%
We are almost out of time here.

00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:26.230 align:middle line:84%
So I want to say
if you can stay on,

00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:28.675 align:middle line:84%
I would like to have a
second conversation with you.

00:56:28.675 --> 00:56:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: I'm here.

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, very good.

00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:32.072 align:middle line:90%
Well, we've barely begun.

00:56:32.072 --> 00:56:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Keep an eye out to watch part
two of this when it comes up,

00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
discuss, hopefully,

00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:39.040 align:middle line:84%
the secrets of longevity
and the electrical nature

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.410 align:middle line:84%
of our universe and bodies,
how we can charge them,

00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:42.770 align:middle line:90%
even, and so much more.

00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:45.100 align:middle line:84%
So until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:47.100 align:middle line:90%
on Gaiam TV.

00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:56.700 align:middle line:90%
