>> Regina Meredith: I doubt
there's anyone watching this

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.059 align:middle line:90%
that hasn't had to struggle

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:28.561 align:middle line:84%
with subconscious belief
patterns that have stopped you

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:30.397 align:middle line:90%
from manifesting what you want.

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:34.000 align:middle line:84%
The haunting voices of parents,
teachers, religious leaders,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.603 align:middle line:84%
and societal icons have
left us with the impression

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:40.940 align:middle line:84%
that we are somehow less than
in one area of life or another.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.609 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Nick Delgado has learned

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.278 align:middle line:84%
to overwrite those
patterns with new scripts.

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:47.247 align:middle line:84%
It requires learning
a new kind of focus,

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:49.449 align:middle line:84%
which is called open-eyed
relaxation.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.918 align:middle line:84%
He is joining us now to
show us how it works,

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:53.553 align:middle line:90%
and he says it really does work

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:56.256 align:middle line:84%
to rewrite those
outdated beliefs.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:01:00.193 align:middle line:84%
Welcome. This is something
that I find fascinating,

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:03.163 align:middle line:84%
because I love the power of
hypnosis and self-hypnosis,

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:05.932 align:middle line:84%
and have had quite a bit of
experience personally with it.

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:09.035 align:middle line:84%
And so, I totally appreciate
it when someone has come

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:12.238 align:middle line:84%
up with a very elegant
and direct system

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.574 align:middle line:84%
of accessing the
subconscious mind.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:15.775 align:middle line:90%
Because people are afraid.

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:18.845 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are afraid
to go under hypnosis.

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:21.281 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Delgado: That's exactly
why I tend to refer to it

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:24.217 align:middle line:84%
as laser focused concentration,
because the reality is,

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:28.888 align:middle line:84%
in a deep state of trance, we're
simply relaxed and focused.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.289 align:middle line:90%
We're not zonked out.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.325 align:middle line:84%
We're not unaware of
what we're being told

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:33.927 align:middle line:90%
and what we're hearing.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So the ideal situation
is, when you first wake

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.700 align:middle line:84%
up in the morning, when you're
just barely opening your eyes,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.735 align:middle line:84%
is to listen to the
scripts, or read them.

00:01:43.735 --> 00:01:44.737 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.139 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: I like
to listen to them,

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.943 align:middle line:84%
because if I record them back
into my device, my phone device,

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:53.079 align:middle line:84%
which is always near me, I
play it back and I listen

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.217 align:middle line:84%
to these scripts and they take
me through the very challenges

00:01:57.217 --> 00:02:00.753 align:middle line:84%
that I have, as we all do, in
our society, whether I'm wanting

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:05.058 align:middle line:84%
to manifest better public
speaking or more energy

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:08.495 align:middle line:84%
or to be committed my exercise
program on a daily basis,

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:12.298 align:middle line:84%
as I'm training for my next
world championship competition.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.734 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you just want to
attract that lovely mate

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:16.269 align:middle line:90%
that you've always wanted.

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.638 align:middle line:84%
Or you want to talk better to
your children or your staff

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:21.040 align:middle line:84%
or your employees, or just
treat yourself better.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.377 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's a challenge
that sometimes we realize

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:27.313 align:middle line:84%
that there's so many
things going on,

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.847 align:middle line:84%
and so many things
programming us;

00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:30.850 align:middle line:90%
the television news programs us.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.584 align:middle line:90%
You know...

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:32.619 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:33.286 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...the
church programs us.

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:34.254 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: You bet.

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:35.388 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Our schools
program us.

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:36.656 align:middle line:84%
There's -- everywhere
we go, someone's trying

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:41.761 align:middle line:84%
to divert us away from our
true values and our goals

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:44.564 align:middle line:84%
and help them to
manifest their own.

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:45.265 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Exactly.

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:46.533 align:middle line:90%
Using our people power

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:49.202 align:middle line:84%
to manifest something
for their own system.

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:49.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.738 align:middle line:90%
I don't like that.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:52.839 align:middle line:90%
I do not like that.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: We were born...

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.607 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We are
sovereign beings.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:55.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: ...in America.

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:56.109 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: We will.

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: That's right.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.911 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We're
sovereign beings each

00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:58.511 align:middle line:90%
with a very unique purpose.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:02:59.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:01.147 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And to not be
able to have the possibility

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:02.248 align:middle line:90%
of expressing that, to me,

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:04.183 align:middle line:84%
is one of the saddest
things in the world.

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:05.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.253 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Finding people
even in middle years who say,

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:09.022 align:middle line:84%
oh, I just don't know
what I'm here for,

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:11.323 align:middle line:84%
who haven't had the chance
to even explore that yet.

00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:12.258 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:13.126 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That really
upsets me.

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:14.327 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.528 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So that's why
I like.. that's why I really

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:16.663 align:middle line:90%
like what you're doing.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.998 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, sometimes
when we think about this

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:21.901 align:middle line:84%
and we talk about, oh, we have
a little script for, you know,

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:25.204 align:middle line:84%
attracting your true mate
and so forth, it seems so --

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:84%
almost kind of happy,
New Age, and we think

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.142 align:middle line:90%
of "Saturday Night Live."

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:30.275 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you remember

00:03:30.275 --> 00:03:32.545 align:middle line:84%
when Al Franken did
Stuart Smalley.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:33.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Oh.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.213 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I think was his name.

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:35.347 align:middle line:90%
Standing in front of the mirror.

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:37.650 align:middle line:84%
But by golly, I am
good enough [laughter].

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.686 align:middle line:84%
And it gave the whole
thing such a bad name.

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:41.787 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:43.456 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So let's talk
about it in reality.

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:44.924 align:middle line:90%
You have five kids.

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:47.794 align:middle line:84%
You're a world champion
at strength and endurance.

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:49.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:51.998 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you have a
booming business, obviously,

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:55.301 align:middle line:84%
that you need a tremendous
amount of clarity and focus

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:56.769 align:middle line:90%
to do what you do every day.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:57.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So how did
this project come about?

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:01.808 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: I've
always been attracted

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:04.711 align:middle line:84%
to learning how the
mind functions.

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:06.879 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in my undergraduate
training,

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.849 align:middle line:84%
I went to the University of
Southern California, USC,

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.753 align:middle line:84%
and I spent four years
there as a pre-med student,

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.588 align:middle line:90%
but I focused on psychology.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.057 align:middle line:84%
That was my degree, my
bachelor's degree in psychology.

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:20.793 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Frasier [assumed spelling],
Dr. Laswell [assumed spelling],

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:21.961 align:middle line:90%
the different professors there,

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:24.697 align:middle line:84%
I was lucky because they
were published authors,

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:26.332 align:middle line:84%
but they were continuing
to do research.

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:28.968 align:middle line:84%
It was publish or
perish, you know.

00:04:28.968 --> 00:04:31.938 align:middle line:84%
And so, they were the
firsthand knowledge person.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.773 align:middle line:84%
They were the one who
wrote the textbooks.

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.141 align:middle line:90%
And I was fortunate.

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:38.111 align:middle line:84%
One of the professors put us
through a class of hypnotherapy

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:42.048 align:middle line:84%
and I was concerned because,
you know, he was going to do it.

00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:46.286 align:middle line:84%
But the next class I had was a
calculus organic chemistry class

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:49.622 align:middle line:84%
and I was worried that
if I let myself go under,

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.257 align:middle line:84%
that I would somehow
be distracted

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:53.626 align:middle line:90%
and not be focused for my test.

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:56.929 align:middle line:84%
Little did I know, if I
had learned at that time,

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:59.332 align:middle line:84%
which later the professors
and my teachings,

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:02.902 align:middle line:84%
and trainings showed me, that
the better you learn how to get

00:05:02.902 --> 00:05:06.406 align:middle line:84%
into that relaxed focused
state, the better you learned.

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:08.408 align:middle line:90%
We learn very rapidly.

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:11.377 align:middle line:84%
Our mind can learn and the more
rapid we take on information

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:15.348 align:middle line:84%
in a relaxed state, in a
focused state, we will absorb it

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:18.818 align:middle line:84%
and our unconscious mind can
actually then, which makes 80%

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.153 align:middle line:90%
or 90% of all our decisions...

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.254 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:22.221 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...will
then be reconditioned

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:23.990 align:middle line:84%
to do what we want
on daily basis.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.458 align:middle line:90%
And here's the exciting thing.

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:29.162 align:middle line:84%
One study came out, American
Health, and it showed

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:33.166 align:middle line:84%
that it took 600
psychoanalysis sessions

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:37.103 align:middle line:84%
with only a 30% success rate
with why the client came

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:38.938 align:middle line:84%
to see the doctor,
laying on a couch,

00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:42.041 align:middle line:84%
telling the doctor what their
problems were from childhood.

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.410 align:middle line:90%
In all, 600 sessions.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.181 align:middle line:84%
Behavioral therapy
only took 72 sessions,

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:51.784 align:middle line:84%
and that elicited
a 67% success rate.

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:53.653 align:middle line:90%
But here's the exciting thing.

00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:56.289 align:middle line:84%
Hypnotherapy only
took six sessions

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.125 align:middle line:90%
and had a 97% success rate.

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:00.193 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Oh, I'm
with you on that.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:00.860 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.494 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:02.061 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I know.

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:03.196 align:middle line:90%
It is beautiful.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:04.964 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, we can
do that for ourselves.

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:06.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And what
you're talking about,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.002 align:middle line:84%
everybody knows this, because
when information is flying

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:12.105 align:middle line:84%
at us, you know,
we'll be like this.

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:14.307 align:middle line:84%
People will often go like
this and say, hold on.

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:16.075 align:middle line:90%
Hold on. Just as second.

00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:17.844 align:middle line:90%
Just a second.

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:21.247 align:middle line:84%
And once that happens and you
can back off and take a breath

00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
and open your mind, then
you can absorb the onslaught

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.550 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.718 align:middle line:90%
We all do this all the time.

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:26.652 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Slowing
that world down.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.421 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:29.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:31.824 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You know, I
think it takes a combination

00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:35.027 align:middle line:90%
of trust in the script.

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:38.798 align:middle line:84%
I went through all my
colleagues' scripts

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:43.369 align:middle line:84%
and I decided that some of them
were misread or miswritten.

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:48.007 align:middle line:84%
They would talk about, say, you
know, a no carbohydrate diet,

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:51.043 align:middle line:84%
which -- I'm a big believer
in whole plant foods,

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:54.046 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't believe in zero
carbohydrates, and I thought

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:55.047 align:middle line:90%
that would mislead people.

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:56.449 align:middle line:90%
So junk in, junk out.

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.951 align:middle line:84%
You have to program the
right information in.

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:03.456 align:middle line:84%
So I went through my 35 years
of experience in psychology

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:07.226 align:middle line:84%
and science and nutrition
and health and anti-aging,

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:08.895 align:middle line:84%
and I went through
word for word,

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:10.396 align:middle line:90%
and I corrected the scripts.

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.265 align:middle line:90%
I revised them and updated them.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.533 align:middle line:90%
And where it said hypnosis,

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:15.802 align:middle line:84%
I used relaxed focused
concentration.

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:17.069 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because
it scares people.

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:18.137 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: It scares people.

00:07:18.137 --> 00:07:19.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:21.507 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: They don't -- they
attribute to stage hypnosis,

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and the reality is when a
state hypnotist who's very good

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.415 align:middle line:84%
at his trade has susceptible
or highly suggestible clients

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:33.286 align:middle line:84%
on stage, the reality is the
best hypnotist in the world,

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:36.522 align:middle line:84%
a hypnotherapist know,
that they choose clients

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:38.758 align:middle line:90%
that are willing to pretend.

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was first trained in --
with Dr. Tad James in hypnosis

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.698 align:middle line:90%
and Christopher Morrison,

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:48.334 align:middle line:84%
and also in timeline
therapy and NLP.

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And the exciting thing
was that we paired

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.605 align:middle line:90%
up with the other students.

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:54.841 align:middle line:84%
And I said -- I asked
my professor.

00:07:54.841 --> 00:07:56.275 align:middle line:84%
I said, who's the
best in the room?

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:57.777 align:middle line:90%
And he said, she is.

00:07:57.777 --> 00:07:58.911 align:middle line:90%
She's the best.

00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:00.847 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to team
up with her because,

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:03.516 align:middle line:84%
as we went through our
scripts and our practices,

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:06.619 align:middle line:84%
I came up to her, and as I asked
the other students, I said,

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:09.455 align:middle line:84%
what do you think about
going to a deep trance state?

00:08:09.455 --> 00:08:13.926 align:middle line:84%
And many of them would say,
well, I do it as a practice,

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:16.796 align:middle line:84%
as a therapist, but I've
never been hypnotized

00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:18.865 align:middle line:90%
or in a deep trance.

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:21.367 align:middle line:84%
And I look at them
and I go, well,

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:23.436 align:middle line:90%
you're a practicing therapist.

00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:26.205 align:middle line:84%
And so, when I talked to
her, she said, oh, I love it.

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:28.173 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what do
you love about it?

00:08:28.173 --> 00:08:32.912 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, imagine like
a child, how a child pretends.

00:08:32.912 --> 00:08:36.215 align:middle line:84%
If I tell you to stand up, just
imagine yourself standing up.

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:39.385 align:middle line:84%
If I tell you float up into
the sky above the clouds,

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:41.554 align:middle line:84%
above the stars,
imagine yourself.

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Like Disney World,
imagine yourself.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.091 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:46.459 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And she
said, the imagination,

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:50.162 align:middle line:84%
as Einstein once stated, is the
most powerful thing we have.

00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:51.564 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:54.233 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And she said, let
me tell you how I know it works,

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:55.434 align:middle line:90%
and I'm all ears listening.

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:59.572 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, I had to
have abdominal surgery

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:02.642 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't have anesthesia
because I'm allergic to it.

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:04.076 align:middle line:90%
I would have died.

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:08.281 align:middle line:84%
And I had to learn the
practice of self-relaxation

00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:09.715 align:middle line:90%
and deep trance phenomenon.

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:10.883 align:middle line:90%
Beyond hypnosis.

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:12.084 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:15.788 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And she said,
I underwent the surgery.

00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:17.723 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel it.

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:20.660 align:middle line:84%
I imagined I was in
a different place.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.962 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm going to
teach you how to do it.

00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:23.863 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, wow.

00:09:23.863 --> 00:09:26.365 align:middle line:90%
I was so excited.

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:27.199 align:middle line:90%
And I continued.

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:28.601 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:31.103 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Every book I read,
every script, Milton Erickson,

00:09:31.103 --> 00:09:32.405 align:middle line:90%
the famous medical doctor.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:32.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:34.240 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.609 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And I studied and
found Bandler and Grinder.

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:39.245 align:middle line:84%
Richard Bandler, very
curious, interesting fellow,

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.147 align:middle line:84%
and he's got some
books he's written.

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:44.216 align:middle line:84%
And I recommend that people
read as many different books

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:47.353 align:middle line:84%
as possible if they want
to heighten their awareness

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:52.124 align:middle line:84%
and be the very best they
can be in any work of life.

00:09:52.124 --> 00:09:55.628 align:middle line:84%
I download my books on Amazon
Kindle, and in the last year

00:09:55.628 --> 00:10:00.666 align:middle line:84%
and a half, I've listened
to no less than 172 books.

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:03.836 align:middle line:84%
You're lucky to read 10 books
in one subject and you become

00:10:03.836 --> 00:10:05.838 align:middle line:90%
and expert on that subject.

00:10:05.838 --> 00:10:07.506 align:middle line:90%
That's been well documented.

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:09.642 align:middle line:84%
Napoleon Hill was
one of the greats.

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:11.677 align:middle line:84%
And in his new book
that just got released.

00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:12.912 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina:  Think
and Be Rich , yes.

00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:14.647 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: His new book,
Outwitting the Devil ,

00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:16.315 align:middle line:90%
that just got released.

00:10:16.315 --> 00:10:16.983 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, yeah.

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:18.451 align:middle line:90%
What is that about?

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.687 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You know, the book
was suppressed for over 75 years

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:23.255 align:middle line:90%
because the family was concerned

00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:27.259 align:middle line:84%
if it had gotten released before
the family was still alive

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:29.662 align:middle line:84%
that there would be some
concerns and criticisms.

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:32.999 align:middle line:84%
Why? Because Napoleon
Hill went into great depth

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:37.069 align:middle line:84%
of his true feelings
about religion, about sex,

00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:40.773 align:middle line:84%
about business, and life, and
he told it the way it really is.

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:43.876 align:middle line:84%
I think he was so far
ahead of his time,

00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:45.277 align:middle line:84%
and I think partly
because, as you know,

00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:48.714 align:middle line:84%
the story with Napoleon Hill, he
interviewed the greatest minds

00:10:48.714 --> 00:10:50.983 align:middle line:84%
and the most successful
people of his time.

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:51.751 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.352 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Ford, Edison.

00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:54.620 align:middle line:90%
I mean, all the greats.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.856 align:middle line:90%
Taft and the presidents.

00:10:56.856 --> 00:11:00.159 align:middle line:84%
And he learned what
made them successful

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:03.896 align:middle line:84%
and he just simply incorporated
their belief systems,

00:11:03.896 --> 00:11:05.731 align:middle line:84%
not their values,
but how they went

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:08.167 align:middle line:90%
about accomplishing their goals.

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:10.803 align:middle line:84%
And so, what we've discovered
is, and he made this clear

00:11:10.803 --> 00:11:15.908 align:middle line:84%
in his book  Outwitting the
Devil , he said specifically,

00:11:15.908 --> 00:11:20.146 align:middle line:84%
repetition of what's most
important to you, the focus

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:24.650 align:middle line:84%
and repetition of that very
goal, will make you successful.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:25.418 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:27.186 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it is that easy.

00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:28.254 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:29.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I mean,
for me, it comes in --

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:31.757 align:middle line:84%
I'm more like the woman that you
talked about, and I've played

00:11:31.757 --> 00:11:32.958 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of hypnosis.

00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:33.993 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:35.694 align:middle line:84%
I like going into
these altered states

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:36.896 align:middle line:90%
and guiding others into it.

00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:38.197 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:39.598 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But one of the
things I found is if I want

00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:41.834 align:middle line:84%
to create something new, a new
project, a new stage of life,

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:44.303 align:middle line:84%
I spend a lot of
time daydreaming.

00:11:44.303 --> 00:11:46.539 align:middle line:84%
I call it daydreaming,
which is just driving,

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:49.942 align:middle line:84%
maybe running errands, or
when I wake up and go to bed,

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:54.313 align:middle line:84%
imagining how I want to feel
in this thing that I want to do

00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:55.681 align:middle line:90%
and I want to accomplish.

00:11:55.681 --> 00:11:58.651 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very visceral thing,
with people around laughing

00:11:58.651 --> 00:12:00.753 align:middle line:84%
and doing, you know,
accomplishing together.

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:02.521 align:middle line:84%
It can be whatever -- depending
if it's a group effort.

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:03.322 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:04.356 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: But the point is,

00:12:04.356 --> 00:12:06.959 align:middle line:84%
it's just very pleasurable
daydreaming

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:08.627 align:middle line:84%
and it only takes
just a matter of time

00:12:08.627 --> 00:12:10.329 align:middle line:90%
and it does come into reality.

00:12:10.329 --> 00:12:11.664 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:14.934 align:middle line:84%
I think people can associate
with being in a move theater

00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:18.471 align:middle line:84%
and everything around
them disappears.

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:20.072 align:middle line:90%
The theater, the big screen.

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:21.107 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:21.874 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And when
the Hulk's running

00:12:21.874 --> 00:12:23.676 align:middle line:90%
at them, they get scared.

00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:26.045 align:middle line:84%
Their heart goes up
and they get terrified,

00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:27.980 align:middle line:90%
because they're in the moment.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.649 align:middle line:84%
So with accessing
the unconscious mind,

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:34.086 align:middle line:84%
the first rule is pretend
and make it believable...

00:12:34.086 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...exciting
and real.

00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:40.493 align:middle line:84%
And then, as we incorporate
what it is we want,

00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:45.498 align:middle line:84%
be careful to be clear that
your goals will be representing

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:46.866 align:middle line:90%
by what you program yourself.

00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:48.667 align:middle line:84%
So if you say, look,
I have a fat butt,

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:50.870 align:middle line:84%
and you keep saying it,
I've always had a fat butt

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.671 align:middle line:84%
and I can never get rid of
that rear end [laughter],

00:12:52.671 --> 00:12:54.874 align:middle line:84%
as Oprah would often
tell herself.

00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:55.574 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Not good.

00:12:55.574 --> 00:12:56.709 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: She'd say,

00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:57.776 align:middle line:84%
I just want to get
rid of this fat butt.

00:12:57.776 --> 00:12:59.512 align:middle line:84%
Well, the unconscious
mind skips I want

00:12:59.512 --> 00:13:01.313 align:middle line:90%
to get rid of, I just want.

00:13:01.313 --> 00:13:02.148 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: They just
hear fat butt [laughter].

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:03.349 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: I want the fat butt.

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:05.384 align:middle line:84%
And she'd lose weight,
gain it, lose it, gain it.

00:13:05.384 --> 00:13:08.287 align:middle line:84%
And now, she's come into, you
know, some of these trainings,

00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:11.223 align:middle line:84%
and I know she's referring
people to Tony Robbins, who --

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:14.193 align:middle line:84%
I worked with Tony Robbins very
closely at Mastery University,

00:13:14.193 --> 00:13:15.528 align:middle line:90%
because I was the health expert.

00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:16.929 align:middle line:90%
You know, anti-aging, health.

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:18.297 align:middle line:90%
But I took advantage.

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:20.432 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I got to go through
all the courses and programs,

00:13:20.432 --> 00:13:22.434 align:middle line:84%
then I went through all
the courses with Tad James

00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:24.737 align:middle line:84%
and Bandler, and I
just kept learning

00:13:24.737 --> 00:13:26.138 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted
to know what I know.

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:28.307 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to know how
do I accomplish anti-aging

00:13:28.307 --> 00:13:29.475 align:middle line:90%
and health and wellness.

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.076 align:middle line:84%
And I would teach
them in exchange.

00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:36.448 align:middle line:84%
I'd go through their
$10,000 or $20,000 courses

00:13:36.448 --> 00:13:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and gain all this
incredible knowledge.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.451 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:13:39.451 --> 00:13:40.586 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You know, there's
a story that I'd like to relate

00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:43.756 align:middle line:84%
to you, and that is that
if you look at the laws

00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:46.458 align:middle line:84%
of supreme influence by Niurka,
and I've written about it

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:49.528 align:middle line:84%
in her book, and you look
at Mark Victor Hansen

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:50.729 align:middle line:84%
and  Chicken Soup
For the Soul ...

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:52.932 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...who's
a good friend of mine,

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and he's in my coaching
program, by the way.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.935 align:middle line:90%
Or you look at Jack Canfield

00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:58.404 align:middle line:84%
with Mark Victor Hansen;
their book on focus.

00:13:58.404 --> 00:13:59.939 align:middle line:90%
It's all about focus.

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:03.909 align:middle line:84%
You focus on a goal and it
becomes your burning desire,

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:05.477 align:middle line:90%
the most exciting thing for you.

00:14:05.477 --> 00:14:07.112 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It has to
have that excitement...

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:08.347 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:09.582 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...and joy, I
find, or it doesn't happen.

00:14:09.582 --> 00:14:10.983 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Correct.

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because then, it's
just a mental construct or...

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:14.119 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...it's somebody
else's expectation of us.

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:15.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Someone
else's expectation.

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:16.589 align:middle line:84%
It could be your mom, said
you should be a doctor.

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You don't
want to be a doctor,

00:14:18.457 --> 00:14:19.024 align:middle line:90%
you want to be an artist.

00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:20.392 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:21.360 align:middle line:84%
You can sit and meditate on
that all day, but if the juices

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.294 align:middle line:84%
in there -- it's
not going to happen.

00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:23.128 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: That's right.

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:23.896 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: At least, not well.

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:24.463 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: That's right.

00:14:24.463 --> 00:14:25.231 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:26.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: That's right.

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:28.300 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm going
after helping a client

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.470 align:middle line:84%
to manifest their biggest
dreams and desires,

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.905 align:middle line:90%
make it big, make it exciting.

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:33.405 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Make it big.

00:14:33.405 --> 00:14:34.673 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:14:34.673 --> 00:14:36.542 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And visualize
it, and here's the thing,

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:39.545 align:middle line:84%
and I have to say this
about affirmations.

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:42.615 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, they don't
always incorporate the correct

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:45.050 align:middle line:84%
language patterns to
bypass critical thinking.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.252 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You see, you
might say, I'm successful.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.221 align:middle line:90%
I'm at a good body weight.

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:51.056 align:middle line:84%
And you're thinking
to yourself, not true.

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.291 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:52.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Not really.

00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:53.892 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:14:53.892 --> 00:14:54.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And you're
denying it.

00:14:54.994 --> 00:14:56.095 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reality is,
the scripts take you

00:14:56.095 --> 00:14:58.230 align:middle line:84%
through the proper
language sequences.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.064 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, they do.

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:00.299 align:middle line:90%
Yours are really well written.

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:01.367 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Thank you.

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:02.568 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I just want
to compliment you.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.069 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And you might
say to yourself, listen.

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:07.473 align:middle line:84%
I want to accomplish this
goal of manifesting wealth.

00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:11.644 align:middle line:84%
I want to earn X dollars,
$1 million, $200,000,

00:15:11.644 --> 00:15:13.145 align:middle line:90%
whatever is your goal.

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:14.480 align:middle line:90%
But somewhere along the way,

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.815 align:middle line:84%
you don't have the
skillset to accomplish that.

00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:18.550 align:middle line:90%
So you're reading the scripts.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.853 align:middle line:84%
So what we implant
within the script is,

00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:25.758 align:middle line:84%
you will access the people who
have the knowledge to train you,

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:29.595 align:middle line:84%
to help you, to guide you, to
bring you to mirror and match

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.463 align:middle line:90%
and learn from those people.

00:15:31.463 --> 00:15:33.966 align:middle line:84%
And the verified [phonetic]
people you hang around with is,

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:36.168 align:middle line:84%
there's been studies on
this, you're most likely

00:15:36.168 --> 00:15:40.406 align:middle line:84%
to manifest their net worth and
income and their success style.

00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:42.875 align:middle line:84%
If you hang around with
people who are unsuccessful,

00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:46.845 align:middle line:84%
they get -- they win the
lottery, they get $10 million,

00:15:46.845 --> 00:15:49.381 align:middle line:84%
and within how many years how
many lottery winners have lost

00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:50.015 align:middle line:90%
all that money?

00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:50.482 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:15:50.482 --> 00:15:51.617 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:52.551 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: They didn't
know how to invest it,

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:53.686 align:middle line:84%
they gave it away,
which was nice.

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:55.020 align:middle line:84%
They gave it away, but
was it for a good cause?

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.989 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it have been better
to invest it and manifest it

00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:59.858 align:middle line:84%
into something greater, to make
it better, and then continue

00:15:59.858 --> 00:16:03.629 align:middle line:84%
that wealth pattern, to be at
$200 million and at $10 million,

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:06.031 align:middle line:84%
and then be able to spread
more wealth and health?

00:16:06.031 --> 00:16:08.434 align:middle line:84%
So I look at wealth
as not something

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:10.803 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes certain
spiritual people look at

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.871 align:middle line:90%
and go, oh, not for me.

00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:14.006 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe not for them.

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:16.041 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's something
that they manifest

00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:17.076 align:middle line:90%
and they can contribute,

00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and contribution's
high on their list.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.112 align:middle line:90%
But what is your family?

00:16:20.112 --> 00:16:23.015 align:middle line:84%
Is it your value to be
the healthiest you can be,

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:26.652 align:middle line:84%
the wealthiest, whether it be
in mind and spirit and in body,

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:30.322 align:middle line:84%
and help your family to
be well and happy& I mean,

00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:32.358 align:middle line:84%
a lot of strife occurs
with divorces.

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:34.927 align:middle line:84%
You know, one is out
there working non-stop

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:36.028 align:middle line:90%
and the other one's saying,

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:37.296 align:middle line:84%
"How come you're not
earning enough, honey?

00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:39.631 align:middle line:84%
We can't even fix the garbage
disposal, and, you know,

00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:40.999 align:middle line:84%
we don't have enough
food on the table.

00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:42.534 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's
tough times now."

00:16:42.534 --> 00:16:46.372 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: People can complain
all they want about money

00:16:46.372 --> 00:16:49.274 align:middle line:84%
and the evils of the way
the system works, which --

00:16:49.274 --> 00:16:50.843 align:middle line:84%
I'll be the first
in line to complain

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:53.345 align:middle line:84%
about the way this
systems is constructed.

00:16:53.345 --> 00:17:00.052 align:middle line:84%
But within that system, you can
still manage the flow of events

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:03.822 align:middle line:84%
and sustenance and money and so
forth so that it can still work

00:17:03.822 --> 00:17:06.091 align:middle line:84%
for you, even in these
very difficult times.

00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:07.292 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:08.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I think that's
something that's really

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:09.061 align:middle line:90%
important for people to know.

00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:10.129 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Times are tough.

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:11.597 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's not so easy
to go down and get

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:12.731 align:middle line:90%
that exact job you want,

00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:14.366 align:middle line:84%
and because maybe 100
other people instead

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:16.001 align:middle line:90%
of 10 other people want it.

00:17:16.001 --> 00:17:17.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:19.004 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But you can still
create that kind of edge

00:17:19.004 --> 00:17:22.107 align:middle line:84%
for yourself through your own
enthusiasm, and as you say,

00:17:22.107 --> 00:17:23.308 align:middle line:90%
these -- this scripting,

00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:26.278 align:middle line:84%
this change of subconscious
belief, absolutely.

00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:27.846 align:middle line:90%
It's not a dead end.

00:17:27.846 --> 00:17:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Eckart Tolle once
said that enthusiasm and joy...

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.384 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:33.419 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...is one
of the keys to success,

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:35.220 align:middle line:84%
but he added the
work acceptance.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.488 align:middle line:84%
And you know why
he said acceptance?

00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:37.289 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Mm-mm.

00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:38.524 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: He said, listen.

00:17:38.524 --> 00:17:40.859 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes along the way,
you've got to do a chore...

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:42.094 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:43.228 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...that you
can't get anyone else to do.

00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:44.329 align:middle line:90%
And you -- make.

00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:45.397 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Got to pay
your dues sometimes.

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:46.398 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And make
it your best effort.

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:47.099 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:47.666 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Accept it.

00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:48.667 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:17:48.667 --> 00:17:49.435 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Be the
best shoe shiner.

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:50.803 align:middle line:90%
Be the best window washer.

00:17:50.803 --> 00:17:51.837 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:52.805 align:middle line:84%
Be the best waiter
if you got to go do

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:54.006 align:middle line:90%
that for a while. Be the best.

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:55.073 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Isn't it fun
when you're around someone

00:17:55.073 --> 00:17:57.609 align:middle line:84%
who might be in the
service profession

00:17:57.609 --> 00:17:59.011 align:middle line:90%
and they're telling you jokes.

00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:01.547 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was in the
airport line coming through

00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:04.116 align:middle line:84%
and the security guard,
he was telling jokes.

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:07.186 align:middle line:84%
He was -- it was
entertaining to listen to him.

00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:09.054 align:middle line:84%
Like, he's really
got a good attitude.

00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:10.289 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It is.

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:12.124 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, there are
situations we all fall into,

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:14.660 align:middle line:84%
especially -- well, in my field,
which is media, which is...

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.894 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:18:15.894 --> 00:18:16.829 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...part of --
the field of entertainment,

00:18:16.829 --> 00:18:18.664 align:middle line:84%
whether you're a
journalist or not.

00:18:18.664 --> 00:18:20.432 align:middle line:90%
That's not an easy profession...

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:21.567 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:22.267 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...in that
is always up and down

00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:23.602 align:middle line:90%
and it's never secure.

00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:27.206 align:middle line:84%
And I had a situation one
time where I was between jobs.

00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.641 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I had been an
anchor at a station...

00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:30.576 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:31.343 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...and
they downsized.

00:18:31.343 --> 00:18:32.744 align:middle line:90%
I was gone.

00:18:32.744 --> 00:18:34.413 align:middle line:84%
I was doing -- actually, it was
called the envi-report

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:36.181 align:middle line:90%
on the main -- nightly news,

00:18:36.181 --> 00:18:38.083 align:middle line:84%
and waiting for funding
on a documentary.

00:18:38.083 --> 00:18:40.052 align:middle line:84%
So I went to work at a cafe
that was down the street

00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:41.353 align:middle line:90%
from that very station.

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:43.856 align:middle line:84%
My friend owned the cafe
and he wouldn't hire me.

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:45.123 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Please hire me.

00:18:45.123 --> 00:18:47.025 align:middle line:84%
I need to get out of the
house and see people."

00:18:47.025 --> 00:18:49.995 align:middle line:90%
He did, and I loved that job.

00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:50.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:52.097 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I made
so many friends.

00:18:52.097 --> 00:18:53.932 align:middle line:84%
I made wonderful
friends from that.

00:18:53.932 --> 00:18:56.802 align:middle line:84%
It was a very kind of
nurturing period of time

00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:59.071 align:middle line:90%
in life, and I value that job.

00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:02.007 align:middle line:84%
Basically making coffee
drinks behind the counter.

00:19:02.007 --> 00:19:03.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:04.676 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But what happened,
when my former news anchors,

00:19:04.676 --> 00:19:07.679 align:middle line:84%
co-anchors, came in for
lunch and they saw me there,

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:10.883 align:middle line:84%
there was this dread,
this humiliation.

00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:11.683 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

00:19:11.683 --> 00:19:13.051 align:middle line:90%
What if that happened to me?

00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:13.719 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:14.686 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Mm-hmm.

00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:15.487 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And there
is this judgment

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:16.121 align:middle line:90%
that goes with all of it...

00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:17.256 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Sure.

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:18.557 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...when, in
fact, I consider that --

00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:20.259 align:middle line:84%
it was a wonderful little
period of life before I got

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:21.860 align:middle line:84%
on with making my
next documentary.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.228 align:middle line:90%
It was wonderful.

00:19:23.228 --> 00:19:24.796 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You know,
Regina, there's stories

00:19:24.796 --> 00:19:28.300 align:middle line:84%
of Hollywood stars, and I think
-- my favorite is Jim Carrey.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.436 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a little
letter and he sealed it.

00:19:31.436 --> 00:19:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And the letter was, "One day,
I'm going to take a movie part

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.543 align:middle line:84%
and write myself a
$10 million check."

00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:38.744 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I remember
that [laughter].

00:19:38.744 --> 00:19:40.946 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And, you know,
he was waiting on tables

00:19:40.946 --> 00:19:43.849 align:middle line:84%
and taking, you know,
miscellaneous jobs.

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:46.718 align:middle line:84%
And one day, he wrote
himself that check.

00:19:46.718 --> 00:19:47.853 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:49.788 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: He kept that
dream alive and he knew

00:19:49.788 --> 00:19:52.891 align:middle line:84%
that somehow he had to
perfect his speaking skills,

00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:54.226 align:middle line:90%
his acting skills.

00:19:54.226 --> 00:19:55.761 align:middle line:90%
He had to make humor.

00:19:55.761 --> 00:19:59.231 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, life
has what you draw.

00:19:59.231 --> 00:20:02.134 align:middle line:84%
And there's a vibrational energy
that you and I know about.

00:20:02.134 --> 00:20:03.502 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And that vibrational
energy may attract me being

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.471 align:middle line:90%
on the show.

00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:07.973 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, friends
knew who I was.

00:20:07.973 --> 00:20:09.808 align:middle line:84%
They heard me speaking at
an event and they said,

00:20:09.808 --> 00:20:12.210 align:middle line:84%
"You've got to get
on this talk show."

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.579 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even know about it.

00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:15.614 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And then, the next
thing I knew producer's calling

00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:16.648 align:middle line:90%
me and here I am.

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:17.416 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:18.817 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: You manifest.

00:20:18.817 --> 00:20:21.486 align:middle line:84%
And who knows how many lives I
will touch and you will touch

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:25.190 align:middle line:84%
by somehow giving
them hope, faith,

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.259 align:middle line:90%
confidence, and self-esteem.

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:31.029 align:middle line:84%
You see, whatever you
value, all of us can benefit

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:34.900 align:middle line:90%
from those high-level,

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.771 align:middle line:84%
high-vibrational
purpose-driven factors.

00:20:39.771 --> 00:20:43.275 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, two people can
go for a job, and you might go

00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:46.878 align:middle line:84%
for a job that pays the
bills, and that's okay.

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:48.914 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, you're
working on another project

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:50.515 align:middle line:84%
that you're really
passionate about.

00:20:50.515 --> 00:20:53.352 align:middle line:84%
Do that job good,
but eventually,

00:20:53.352 --> 00:20:54.953 align:middle line:90%
get yourself into that purpose.

00:20:54.953 --> 00:20:56.788 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Don't forget
that dream; that's the key.

00:20:56.788 --> 00:20:57.856 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: That dream.

00:20:57.856 --> 00:20:58.523 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Don't give
up on that dream.

00:20:58.523 --> 00:20:59.725 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:03.128 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Well, we're on the
same page on all of this.

00:21:03.128 --> 00:21:06.164 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about
this eyes open relaxation,

00:21:06.164 --> 00:21:07.599 align:middle line:84%
because it's a little
different form...

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.167 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...of
self-hypnosis than most.

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:09.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:21:09.835 --> 00:21:11.069 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Normally,

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:12.070 align:middle line:84%
we see ourselves going
inside and closing the eyes.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.872 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what this
means first.

00:21:13.872 --> 00:21:15.574 align:middle line:84%
And then, I'm going to have
you do a demonstration.

00:21:15.574 --> 00:21:16.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Sure.

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:17.809 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And I'm going
to invite everybody

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:21.113 align:middle line:84%
in the audience watching
this to go along with it

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:25.250 align:middle line:84%
and see how effective this is
in a very short space of time.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.153 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You know,
people need to recognize

00:21:28.153 --> 00:21:29.755 align:middle line:90%
that you can have your eyes open

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:32.257 align:middle line:84%
and be manifesting your
goals and your dreams.

00:21:32.257 --> 00:21:34.993 align:middle line:84%
The key is, if you're
a person who prefers

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:37.829 align:middle line:84%
to have your eyes closed during
the scripts, then go ahead

00:21:37.829 --> 00:21:40.098 align:middle line:84%
and read the scripts
into your iPhone

00:21:40.098 --> 00:21:42.334 align:middle line:84%
or your Android and
play it back.

00:21:42.334 --> 00:21:47.606 align:middle line:84%
And then, if it's a lot of
distractions, in our profession,

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:49.141 align:middle line:90%
we learn with the distractions.

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:50.242 align:middle line:90%
We state to our self.

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:52.611 align:middle line:84%
You heard the clanking
of the chair

00:21:52.611 --> 00:21:55.247 align:middle line:84%
or you hear the background
cans rocking.

00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:59.217 align:middle line:84%
That allows me to go a deeper
state of relaxation and focus.

00:21:59.217 --> 00:22:02.487 align:middle line:84%
The key is just keeping your
mind on focus and on track.

00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:04.623 align:middle line:84%
So I'm okay whether
people allow themselves

00:22:04.623 --> 00:22:08.393 align:middle line:84%
to have their eyes open while
they read the scripts, which --

00:22:08.393 --> 00:22:09.761 align:middle line:90%
the biggest problem that I see

00:22:09.761 --> 00:22:13.765 align:middle line:84%
in hypnosis and/or timeline
therapy, or any of these fields

00:22:13.765 --> 00:22:18.370 align:middle line:84%
of psychoanalysis, the
reality is that if you go

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:21.440 align:middle line:84%
into a very deep state
of trance, and you

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.708 align:middle line:90%
and I are really good at that.

00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:25.277 align:middle line:84%
We love it because it's a
beautiful state to be in.

00:22:25.277 --> 00:22:26.878 align:middle line:90%
It's a very manifestable --

00:22:26.878 --> 00:22:29.514 align:middle line:84%
something we can
accomplish incredible things

00:22:29.514 --> 00:22:31.083 align:middle line:84%
with our dreams and
make it reality.

00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:34.519 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is, if
you go in really deep,

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:36.722 align:middle line:84%
my clients sometimes
fall asleep.

00:22:36.722 --> 00:22:38.223 align:middle line:90%
And if they're asleep,

00:22:38.223 --> 00:22:40.859 align:middle line:84%
there might be some
subliminal suggestion,

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:42.861 align:middle line:84%
but that's not too
easy to prove.

00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:43.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No.

00:22:43.929 --> 00:22:44.763 align:middle line:84%
You have to stay at
that level where...

00:22:44.763 --> 00:22:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: You have to stay.

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:46.331 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: ...

00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:46.765 align:middle line:84%
theta, alpha around
that border there.

00:22:46.765 --> 00:22:48.166 align:middle line:90%
Yeah..

00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:49.234 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: So while I'm taking
my clients through the process,

00:22:49.234 --> 00:22:50.502 align:middle line:90%
I'm watching them closely.

00:22:50.502 --> 00:22:51.903 align:middle line:90%
I'm watching their breathiness.

00:22:51.903 --> 00:22:54.306 align:middle line:84%
Okay. They're in a deep state,
but I'll even tell them ahead,

00:22:54.306 --> 00:22:56.341 align:middle line:84%
during the course,
I'm going to ask you

00:22:56.341 --> 00:22:59.511 align:middle line:84%
to periodically open your
eyes and close your eyes

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:02.147 align:middle line:84%
so I know you're listening
and you're paying attention.

00:23:02.147 --> 00:23:05.183 align:middle line:84%
The worst is, I'm going through
a script and they're so relaxed,

00:23:05.183 --> 00:23:06.585 align:middle line:84%
the next thing they're
[snoring].

00:23:06.585 --> 00:23:12.524 align:middle line:84%
And I, like, open your eyes so
you can absorb the information.

00:23:12.524 --> 00:23:13.658 align:middle line:84%
And they're still
going [snoring].

00:23:13.658 --> 00:23:16.394 align:middle line:84%
They're not listening
to a word I'm saying.

00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:16.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No.

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:17.729 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:18.797 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: So we've discovered

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:21.533 align:middle line:84%
that the eyes open
laser focus is the best,

00:23:21.533 --> 00:23:22.801 align:middle line:90%
because in most cases,

00:23:22.801 --> 00:23:25.036 align:middle line:84%
it's keeping them
focused on the script.

00:23:25.036 --> 00:23:26.037 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:23:26.037 --> 00:23:26.838 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And after
six sessions,

00:23:26.838 --> 00:23:27.873 align:middle line:90%
they are going to manifest.

00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:29.241 align:middle line:84%
And they can be in
a light trance,

00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:31.143 align:middle line:84%
a deep trance, a
moderate trance.

00:23:31.143 --> 00:23:34.279 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter where
you think you are,

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:36.181 align:middle line:90%
where you know the scripts work,

00:23:36.181 --> 00:23:38.450 align:middle line:84%
my laser focused
concentration scripts work,

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:40.619 align:middle line:84%
is you start manifesting
the behavior.

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:41.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:23:41.386 --> 00:23:42.621 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:44.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: The best example
is I have people who --

00:23:44.189 --> 00:23:49.294 align:middle line:84%
I have a lady who started my
program about four months ago.

00:23:49.294 --> 00:23:51.563 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you know,
I know this information.

00:23:51.563 --> 00:23:53.131 align:middle line:84%
I go to these events
all the time.

00:23:53.131 --> 00:23:56.067 align:middle line:84%
Power of the mind,
healthy diet, exercise.

00:23:56.067 --> 00:23:58.470 align:middle line:90%
But I don't do it.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:59.638 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why I don't do it.

00:23:59.638 --> 00:24:00.438 align:middle line:90%
I just don't do it.

00:24:00.438 --> 00:24:01.573 align:middle line:90%
I don't have the willpower.

00:24:01.573 --> 00:24:02.908 align:middle line:90%
I can't bring myself to do it.

00:24:02.908 --> 00:24:05.644 align:middle line:90%
And I gave her the scripts.

00:24:05.644 --> 00:24:07.846 align:middle line:90%
I said, just read them.

00:24:07.846 --> 00:24:09.614 align:middle line:90%
Trust the scripts.

00:24:09.614 --> 00:24:11.183 align:middle line:90%
Don't critically think.

00:24:11.183 --> 00:24:13.552 align:middle line:84%
Don't say, I don't know
if it's working or not.

00:24:13.552 --> 00:24:17.289 align:middle line:84%
Just read them and trust it
with enthusiasm, and read them.

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:19.858 align:middle line:84%
When you read them into your
phone, read them with enthusiasm

00:24:19.858 --> 00:24:21.593 align:middle line:84%
and excitement as
if it's happening.

00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:24.763 align:middle line:84%
Pretend it's happening
and it will.

00:24:24.763 --> 00:24:27.132 align:middle line:90%
And she said, "I trust you.

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:30.402 align:middle line:84%
I know you've accomplished
amazing goals in your life.

00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:32.971 align:middle line:84%
You've broken world records
against guys half your age.

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:33.538 align:middle line:90%
You're still competing.

00:24:33.538 --> 00:24:34.372 align:middle line:90%
You're."

00:24:34.372 --> 00:24:35.373 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And twice your size.

00:24:35.373 --> 00:24:36.374 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You're
-- twice my size.

00:24:36.374 --> 00:24:37.776 align:middle line:84%
Not -- and guys over
the age of 50.

00:24:37.776 --> 00:24:39.911 align:middle line:84%
I'm going against an
all classic in a month.

00:24:39.911 --> 00:24:41.279 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Strength
endurance competitions.

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:42.781 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Against the world's
strongest strength endurance

00:24:42.781 --> 00:24:44.115 align:middle line:84%
athletes and they're
going to look at me,

00:24:44.115 --> 00:24:45.150 align:middle line:90%
like they've had in the past.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.518 align:middle line:90%
Now, they know who I am.

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:84%
But they'll say, oh, you're
here to watch your son compete,

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.522 align:middle line:84%
who's, you know,
5'10", 240 pounds.

00:24:50.522 --> 00:24:51.923 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:24:51.923 --> 00:24:55.393 align:middle line:84%
All 5'8" of me and 170 pounds
and, you know, a year from 60.

00:24:55.393 --> 00:24:56.661 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to compete
and beat you.

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And they look at
me and they laugh.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:24:59.631 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: [Laughter].

00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:00.332 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: They laugh.

00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:00.999 align:middle line:90%
They say, that's funny.

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:01.700 align:middle line:90%
That's really funny.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:02.400 align:middle line:90%
And then, I beat them...

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.735 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:25:03.735 --> 00:25:04.936 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...with 45 pound
dumbbells lifting overhead,

00:25:04.936 --> 00:25:07.772 align:middle line:84%
and I broke the world
record for curls as well.

00:25:07.772 --> 00:25:10.175 align:middle line:84%
And they -- after they see me
do it, beat them, they go, "Wow.

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:11.376 align:middle line:90%
How did you do it?"

00:25:11.376 --> 00:25:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: They say, where
are those scripts again?

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:12.711 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:13.545 align:middle line:90%
What are those scripts?

00:25:13.545 --> 00:25:14.813 align:middle line:90%
How did you condition your mind?

00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:18.750 align:middle line:84%
How did you manifest the
discipline to workout daily

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:22.754 align:middle line:84%
and have a family of five and
to travel and to have companies

00:25:22.754 --> 00:25:26.424 align:middle line:84%
that you work with and on TV
appearances and write books?

00:25:26.424 --> 00:25:27.759 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you've written 10 books.

00:25:27.759 --> 00:25:28.994 align:middle line:90%
How do you do it all?

00:25:28.994 --> 00:25:30.195 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And in addition,
you've had your share

00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:33.031 align:middle line:84%
of difficulty and
tragedy and challenge.

00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:35.333 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: I've had challenges.

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:37.068 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I mean,
you were telling me...

00:25:37.068 --> 00:25:38.703 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: I've had challenges.

00:25:38.703 --> 00:25:40.171 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...off
camera, that was one

00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:42.440 align:middle line:84%
of the most heartbreaking
things I've ever heard.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.675 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: I've had
family tragedies,

00:25:43.675 --> 00:25:46.044 align:middle line:84%
and my father passed
on just last month.

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:47.579 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, for 15 years,
my father, with good intention,

00:25:47.579 --> 00:25:48.947 align:middle line:90%
you know, he was a truck driver

00:25:48.947 --> 00:25:52.984 align:middle line:84%
and he owned a restaurant
tavern, and his wife, you know,

00:25:52.984 --> 00:25:54.286 align:middle line:90%
they trusted the doctors.

00:25:54.286 --> 00:25:56.354 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors kept
him on a diet

00:25:56.354 --> 00:25:58.757 align:middle line:84%
that they said was
appropriate for his diabetes.

00:25:58.757 --> 00:26:00.525 align:middle line:84%
They kept him on
diabetic medications

00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:04.763 align:middle line:84%
and heart medications, and
Flomax for his prostrate.

00:26:04.763 --> 00:26:06.831 align:middle line:90%
And he wasn't even himself.

00:26:06.831 --> 00:26:09.034 align:middle line:84%
I would talk to him and
he'd forget who I was.

00:26:09.034 --> 00:26:10.402 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Wasn't himself.

00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: He was a shell,
like he wasn't even existing.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.673 align:middle line:84%
And finally, he had
another incident.

00:26:14.673 --> 00:26:15.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry to say.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.909 align:middle line:84%
It was a tragic incident,
but he survived it,

00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:19.077 align:middle line:90%
and then his wife finally said,

00:26:19.077 --> 00:26:20.812 align:middle line:84%
and the family said,
please intervene.

00:26:20.812 --> 00:26:22.180 align:middle line:90%
I know you can do it.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.482 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what will
happen, but let's try.

00:26:24.482 --> 00:26:25.317 align:middle line:90%
They'd all given up.

00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:27.385 align:middle line:90%
The doctors had given up on him.

00:26:27.385 --> 00:26:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "I'm not
going to give up."

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.556 align:middle line:84%
And we started revamping
his diet.

00:26:31.556 --> 00:26:33.625 align:middle line:84%
We started giving
him whole super foods

00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:36.227 align:middle line:84%
and taking him off all
the sugars and the fats

00:26:36.227 --> 00:26:37.429 align:middle line:90%
and the meats and the cheeses

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:39.397 align:middle line:84%
that was supposedly
good for diabetes.

00:26:39.397 --> 00:26:42.434 align:middle line:84%
And the wife said, "This
is the exact opposite

00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:44.302 align:middle line:84%
of what they tell
diabetics to eat."

00:26:44.302 --> 00:26:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.504 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: But I
gave her the scripts.

00:26:46.504 --> 00:26:47.973 align:middle line:84%
We hooked him up to a
neuromuscular stimulator

00:26:47.973 --> 00:26:50.542 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen his muscles
with a Tesla device.

00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:53.111 align:middle line:84%
I put him on all natural
bioidentical hormones.

00:26:53.111 --> 00:26:54.412 align:middle line:90%
I had him on herbs.

00:26:54.412 --> 00:26:55.914 align:middle line:90%
He started functioning again.

00:26:55.914 --> 00:26:57.382 align:middle line:90%
He was laughing, telling jokes.

00:26:57.382 --> 00:26:58.984 align:middle line:90%
He was off his medications.

00:26:58.984 --> 00:27:02.053 align:middle line:84%
And for four precious
months, he was with us.

00:27:02.053 --> 00:27:04.055 align:middle line:84%
He ended up with
another incident.

00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:06.391 align:middle line:84%
I believe an aneurysm blew
out from all the years...

00:27:06.391 --> 00:27:07.759 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...80 years of life
that weakened blood vessels

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.261 align:middle line:90%
from years of, you know.

00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:11.529 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But he had some
wonderful final moments.

00:27:11.529 --> 00:27:12.597 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: But he
had some wonderful --

00:27:12.597 --> 00:27:14.799 align:middle line:84%
and I was there for
him, for my father.

00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:17.168 align:middle line:84%
And I only wish that
more people --

00:27:17.168 --> 00:27:19.437 align:middle line:84%
if not starting early,
start now.

00:27:19.437 --> 00:27:21.006 align:middle line:90%
It's never too late.

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:24.075 align:middle line:84%
As long as you have
a mental capability,

00:27:24.075 --> 00:27:26.745 align:middle line:84%
and even if you don't, hopefully
a love one's hearing this show

00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:28.513 align:middle line:90%
and will intervene and help.

00:27:28.513 --> 00:27:31.316 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is that
manifesting your dreams

00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:33.818 align:middle line:84%
and your goals starts
on a day-to-day basis,

00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:38.623 align:middle line:84%
reading these scripts, and
letting the focused relaxation

00:27:38.623 --> 00:27:40.859 align:middle line:90%
in a deep, natural voice,

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:44.295 align:middle line:84%
a soothing voice
that's enthusiastic.

00:27:44.295 --> 00:27:47.399 align:middle line:84%
And as you read through, it'll
bypass critical thinking,

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:49.801 align:middle line:84%
and particularly if
it's in your own voice,

00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:52.070 align:middle line:90%
your brain will go, okay.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:55.006 align:middle line:84%
After about six readings,
initially you might go, oh.

00:27:55.006 --> 00:27:57.509 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure about,
you know, what he's --

00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:58.910 align:middle line:90%
what I'm saying to myself.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:02.414 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, instead of
these old voices telling you --

00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:05.216 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, Deepak
Chopra once said

00:28:05.216 --> 00:28:07.485 align:middle line:84%
that we have 60,000
thoughts a day,

00:28:07.485 --> 00:28:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and of which over
half are negative.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:28:10.555 --> 00:28:13.491 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: So we have to
reprogram to be in the state,

00:28:13.491 --> 00:28:16.661 align:middle line:84%
to be resourceful, to
manifest that new job,

00:28:16.661 --> 00:28:19.831 align:middle line:84%
to attract that new client,
to be the best on television

00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:23.001 align:middle line:84%
and interviews, to
break a world record,

00:28:23.001 --> 00:28:26.137 align:middle line:84%
and to be the best you can be
and lose that last 20 pounds

00:28:26.137 --> 00:28:29.007 align:middle line:84%
of body fat, or overcome
a chronic disease.

00:28:29.007 --> 00:28:32.744 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, never
believe that it can't be done.

00:28:32.744 --> 00:28:36.848 align:middle line:84%
Believe in the faith of energy
and healing and well-being

00:28:36.848 --> 00:28:39.884 align:middle line:84%
and the power of the
infinite wisdom of your brain

00:28:39.884 --> 00:28:41.753 align:middle line:90%
and the cells of your body

00:28:41.753 --> 00:28:44.389 align:middle line:84%
that we're even here
today communicating

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:45.957 align:middle line:90%
and the energy we're sending now

00:28:45.957 --> 00:28:49.194 align:middle line:84%
out to the world is
affecting millions of people.

00:28:49.194 --> 00:28:50.328 align:middle line:90%
And I -- that is my goal.

00:28:50.328 --> 00:28:51.529 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Because there is this
knocked on effect, always.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:53.932 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:28:53.932 --> 00:28:55.133 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And, you know, the
nice thing about the scripts,

00:28:55.133 --> 00:28:57.202 align:middle line:84%
as you were saying, is you
-- the first six times.

00:28:57.202 --> 00:28:58.670 align:middle line:90%
But through repetition,

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.271 align:middle line:84%
it starts bypassing
the critical thinking.

00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:01.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:04.008 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It just becomes a
familiar background message

00:29:04.008 --> 00:29:04.576 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:05.944 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:29:05.944 --> 00:29:08.079 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And that's when it
really starts taking effect.

00:29:08.079 --> 00:29:09.481 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: I've
had my clients --

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:11.282 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned, the one who said
she didn't have the willpower,

00:29:11.282 --> 00:29:14.586 align:middle line:84%
she said, "You know, I couldn't
bring myself to eat healthy.

00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:17.489 align:middle line:84%
I'd go back to the shopping
mall and I'd see the chocolates.

00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:19.224 align:middle line:90%
I'd just eat it impulsively.

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:20.859 align:middle line:84%
I'd see the hot dog
stand and I'd eat it

00:29:20.859 --> 00:29:22.427 align:middle line:84%
because it was quick
and convenient.

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I'd get junk food for my kids
because it was convenient

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:27.565 align:middle line:84%
and I was conditioned,
through society,

00:29:27.565 --> 00:29:29.901 align:middle line:84%
that that was acceptable
behavior."

00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:30.869 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:31.936 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And she
looked at that

00:29:31.936 --> 00:29:34.272 align:middle line:84%
and she started listening
to the scripts.

00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:37.208 align:middle line:84%
And then, after a while
-- her husband's a dentist

00:29:37.208 --> 00:29:39.377 align:middle line:90%
and really, really well to do.

00:29:39.377 --> 00:29:40.912 align:middle line:90%
She came back two months later.

00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:43.114 align:middle line:90%
She had dropped 15 pounds.

00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:44.482 align:middle line:84%
She looked me in the
eye and she said,

00:29:44.482 --> 00:29:47.418 align:middle line:84%
"I've been using the scripts
and I'm following the program."

00:29:47.418 --> 00:29:50.321 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "I'm doing it
with enthusiasm and excitement.

00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And some of the scripts are
telling me to do certain things

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:54.592 align:middle line:84%
that -- I would have never
thought I would exercise

00:29:54.592 --> 00:29:58.630 align:middle line:84%
consistently or eat healthy or
treat other people in a manner.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.999 align:middle line:84%
"I just feel like
this huge weight

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:03.368 align:middle line:84%
of baggage has been
taken off my shoulders

00:30:03.368 --> 00:30:06.604 align:middle line:84%
and now I know I can do
anything I want in life."

00:30:06.604 --> 00:30:07.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Isn't that amazing?

00:30:07.505 --> 00:30:08.907 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:30:08.907 --> 00:30:10.708 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And like you said, it
doesn't matter if you're 20, 30,

00:30:10.708 --> 00:30:13.645 align:middle line:84%
40, 50, 60, or 70, it's
never too late to begin.

00:30:13.645 --> 00:30:16.247 align:middle line:84%
You can always start
shifting the focus

00:30:16.247 --> 00:30:17.949 align:middle line:84%
over to the positive
again; right?

00:30:17.949 --> 00:30:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:19.784 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: So -- okay.

00:30:19.784 --> 00:30:21.452 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I'd like to do
is -- I chose a script.

00:30:21.452 --> 00:30:22.187 align:middle line:90%
This one is called...

00:30:22.187 --> 00:30:23.054 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Okay.

00:30:23.054 --> 00:30:23.621 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ..."Increased
Energy."

00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:24.722 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:30:24.722 --> 00:30:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And -- well,
I mean, I don't want

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.258 align:middle line:90%
to take a really long time...

00:30:27.258 --> 00:30:28.626 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: I'll make it
brief and to the point.

00:30:28.626 --> 00:30:30.528 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...but just the very
beginning relaxation point.

00:30:30.528 --> 00:30:31.663 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Can you show
us what that feels like?

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:33.898 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:37.235 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, as you get good
with the initial induction,

00:30:37.235 --> 00:30:39.771 align:middle line:84%
which we call induction
to access the deepest...

00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:41.039 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:43.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...state of
relaxation and unconscious mind,

00:30:43.107 --> 00:30:46.411 align:middle line:84%
keep in mind that the best
induction is the most rapid.

00:30:46.411 --> 00:30:47.378 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:30:47.378 --> 00:30:47.912 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I was
going to say, yeah.

00:30:47.912 --> 00:30:49.013 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:50.114 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: So don't
worry about taking --

00:30:50.114 --> 00:30:50.949 align:middle line:84%
initially, it might
take a little longer,

00:30:50.949 --> 00:30:52.350 align:middle line:90%
read through the whole script.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.953 align:middle line:84%
But after a while, just get down
to the key words that allow you

00:30:54.953 --> 00:30:56.888 align:middle line:84%
to relax quickly
and effortlessly.

00:30:56.888 --> 00:30:58.289 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:30:58.289 --> 00:30:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: To the point where
I bet -- you're so good, Regina,

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:03.728 align:middle line:84%
I bet if I said,
Regina, relax your body.

00:31:03.728 --> 00:31:06.097 align:middle line:90%
On a count of 100 to 99,

00:31:06.097 --> 00:31:08.266 align:middle line:84%
you're now 10 times more
relaxed than you were before.

00:31:08.266 --> 00:31:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.368 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try to stay
with you, because I go

00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:11.703 align:middle line:90%
down there easily.

00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:13.471 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And then, I'll
say, relax your mind, Regina.

00:31:13.471 --> 00:31:14.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:31:14.606 --> 00:31:15.907 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: All those
thoughts, relax them.

00:31:15.907 --> 00:31:18.810 align:middle line:84%
100, 99, and with
each number, 98,

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.679 align:middle line:84%
you're now 10 times more
relaxed than you were before.

00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:24.148 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you're so relaxed,
you're out on the beach

00:31:24.148 --> 00:31:25.883 align:middle line:90%
and it's warm and beautiful

00:31:25.883 --> 00:31:28.720 align:middle line:84%
and you're now a million
times more relaxed.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.723 align:middle line:84%
You're accessing the
infinite knowledge and wisdom

00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:35.727 align:middle line:84%
of all the planetary energy,
and all of wisdom is now ready

00:31:35.727 --> 00:31:37.228 align:middle line:90%
to pour into your body.

00:31:37.228 --> 00:31:40.231 align:middle line:84%
And as you float up above
the clouds, above the stars,

00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:43.735 align:middle line:84%
you let go of all those negative
feelings of anger and hurt.

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:46.404 align:middle line:84%
And in the top, through the
top of your head, the love

00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and energy floats
throughout your entire body.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.242 align:middle line:84%
And in this state,
you're now ready

00:31:51.242 --> 00:31:54.045 align:middle line:84%
to access this incredibly
feeling

00:31:54.045 --> 00:31:57.415 align:middle line:84%
of I have more energy,
enthusiasm.

00:31:57.415 --> 00:31:59.751 align:middle line:84%
I enjoy each aspect
of my life more.

00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:03.554 align:middle line:84%
As my energy and enthusiasm
increases greatly, day by day,

00:32:03.554 --> 00:32:05.089 align:middle line:90%
I'm able to feel more alive

00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:08.960 align:middle line:84%
and become more excited
now about whatever I do.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.062 align:middle line:84%
I want to live life
to the fullest

00:32:11.062 --> 00:32:14.065 align:middle line:84%
and get more satisfaction
with every activity.

00:32:14.065 --> 00:32:17.568 align:middle line:84%
Having more energy now
will help me to do this.

00:32:17.568 --> 00:32:18.903 align:middle line:90%
I have more fun.

00:32:18.903 --> 00:32:22.073 align:middle line:84%
When I feel more energy, I
choose to feel more health

00:32:22.073 --> 00:32:24.475 align:middle line:84%
and vibrancy As my
energy increases,

00:32:24.475 --> 00:32:28.379 align:middle line:84%
my sense of vitality
dramatically increases now,

00:32:28.379 --> 00:32:31.916 align:middle line:84%
has become excited and
enthusiastic about my life.

00:32:31.916 --> 00:32:35.787 align:middle line:84%
So each of these scripts imbeds
these wonderful statements.

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:36.854 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: They're very juicy.

00:32:36.854 --> 00:32:39.524 align:middle line:84%
They all have the
power of joy in them.

00:32:39.524 --> 00:32:40.625 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:41.659 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And that is
the critical factor.

00:32:41.659 --> 00:32:44.796 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Joy, love, energy.

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:47.899 align:middle line:84%
If there is more
love in the world,

00:32:47.899 --> 00:32:50.635 align:middle line:84%
if we could accept each
other for what they are.

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:51.536 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's different.

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:53.404 align:middle line:84%
No one has to be
exactly like us.

00:32:53.404 --> 00:32:56.574 align:middle line:84%
I have a script that helped
me to deal with my teenagers.

00:32:56.574 --> 00:32:58.276 align:middle line:90%
I have five children.

00:32:58.276 --> 00:33:01.012 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, sometimes they
don't make the best decisions,

00:33:01.012 --> 00:33:02.947 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion.

00:33:02.947 --> 00:33:05.283 align:middle line:90%
But maybe for them, it's okay.

00:33:05.283 --> 00:33:07.819 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite books
by Wayne Dyer, you know,

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:10.588 align:middle line:84%
What We've Always Wanted For
Our Children , and I listened

00:33:10.588 --> 00:33:12.490 align:middle line:90%
to it on Kindle several times.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.360 align:middle line:84%
It took me several because I
had to really emergent in some

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.496 align:middle line:84%
of these -- I don't know
if I can accept that one.

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:21.766 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, after a while,
acceptance, enthusiasm, and joy,

00:33:21.766 --> 00:33:23.468 align:middle line:84%
these scripts will
change your life.

00:33:23.468 --> 00:33:25.069 align:middle line:84%
They'll help you lose
weight, increase your energy,

00:33:25.069 --> 00:33:26.971 align:middle line:84%
make more money,
have better sex.

00:33:26.971 --> 00:33:30.441 align:middle line:84%
It's all in the scripts and
in your mind, in acceptance.

00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:32.076 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because that's the
only thing standing in the way

00:33:32.076 --> 00:33:34.312 align:middle line:84%
of us and anything
that we desire anyway.

00:33:34.312 --> 00:33:35.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:36.247 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And in the end,

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:37.648 align:middle line:84%
it's always our own
subconscious programming.

00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:39.917 align:middle line:84%
One of the things -- you talked
-- and I just want to go back

00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:40.918 align:middle line:90%
and hit on it, because...

00:33:40.918 --> 00:33:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.121 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...some people
don't know what it is.

00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:43.955 align:middle line:84%
Could you talk a
little bit about your --

00:33:43.955 --> 00:33:45.323 align:middle line:90%
you do timeline therapy.

00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:46.324 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:33:46.324 --> 00:33:47.959 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What is
timeline therapy?

00:33:47.959 --> 00:33:52.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Timeline therapy
is a higher level of NLP,

00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:56.901 align:middle line:84%
neural linguistic programming,
deep trance phenomena,

00:33:56.901 --> 00:34:01.606 align:middle line:84%
and accessing the fact that
we all organize our mind

00:34:01.606 --> 00:34:03.207 align:middle line:90%
and our thoughts and our lives

00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:04.976 align:middle line:84%
and every experience
we've ever had.

00:34:04.976 --> 00:34:07.879 align:middle line:84%
There's a slow recorder that
start from the day we were born,

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:11.115 align:middle line:84%
possibly even before we were
born, and whether we believe

00:34:11.115 --> 00:34:15.720 align:middle line:84%
in past lives or not, we
ask people this question.

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.023 align:middle line:84%
Was that first incident
of anger that occurred,

00:34:19.023 --> 00:34:21.691 align:middle line:84%
and due to gestalt and
psychology, when anger occurs,

00:34:21.691 --> 00:34:24.128 align:middle line:84%
it's triggered by something and
maybe someone yelled at your

00:34:24.128 --> 00:34:26.564 align:middle line:84%
or spanked you or
hurt you or abused

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:28.733 align:middle line:90%
or raped you or something.

00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:32.603 align:middle line:84%
But every time in your life,
from the beginning to the end,

00:34:32.603 --> 00:34:35.673 align:middle line:84%
there's these gestalts, or
triggers, and it gets magnified.

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:37.909 align:middle line:84%
And so, what -- maybe
someone says something simple

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.376 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't even seem --

00:34:39.376 --> 00:34:42.447 align:middle line:84%
like, why would you fly off
the handle and get angry?

00:34:42.447 --> 00:34:44.816 align:middle line:84%
It was a trigger in your
mind and someone touched you

00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:47.117 align:middle line:84%
when someone died and it was so
hurtful and you started to cry

00:34:47.117 --> 00:34:48.486 align:middle line:90%
and you don't know why.

00:34:48.486 --> 00:34:52.623 align:middle line:84%
So the mind and the body is
constantly filtering millions

00:34:52.623 --> 00:34:55.226 align:middle line:84%
of bits of information, but can
only take about eight or so bits

00:34:55.226 --> 00:34:56.594 align:middle line:90%
of information in at a time.

00:34:56.594 --> 00:35:00.731 align:middle line:84%
So in timeline therapy, we
use this ingenious technique

00:35:00.731 --> 00:35:05.002 align:middle line:84%
where we take people through
the five emotions of hurt,

00:35:05.002 --> 00:35:09.640 align:middle line:84%
unresourceful anger, fear,
guilt, sadness, and worry.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.809 align:middle line:84%
And we take people back
into their timeline

00:35:11.809 --> 00:35:13.578 align:middle line:84%
where the first incident
occurred...

00:35:13.578 --> 00:35:14.512 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:35:14.512 --> 00:35:15.913 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...and
we release it.

00:35:15.913 --> 00:35:17.748 align:middle line:84%
And now, we put in empowering
-- and I don't let the client --

00:35:17.748 --> 00:35:19.317 align:middle line:84%
I don't tell the client
what the empowering word is.

00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:21.752 align:middle line:84%
I say, "Tell me what the
opposite of sadness is for you,

00:35:21.752 --> 00:35:23.354 align:middle line:84%
or what the opposite
of hurt is."

00:35:23.354 --> 00:35:25.256 align:middle line:84%
And they tell me, whether,
you know, whether it's --

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:27.792 align:middle line:84%
confidence is the
opposite of fear;

00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:29.227 align:middle line:90%
whatever words they choose.

00:35:29.227 --> 00:35:31.696 align:middle line:84%
So then, as we go through
the induction process,

00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:34.765 align:middle line:84%
and as we float back into the
past, and if they're not willing

00:35:34.765 --> 00:35:37.735 align:middle line:84%
to let it go, don't get
caught in the incident'.

00:35:37.735 --> 00:35:40.505 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, it was a fight
scene and someone hurt you.

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:43.441 align:middle line:84%
I tell people, go one
day before it occurred

00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:45.042 align:middle line:84%
so it never occurred,
but you're seeing it.

00:35:45.042 --> 00:35:48.146 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So when you change
that scenario in the timeline...

00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:49.146 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:35:49.146 --> 00:35:50.047 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...from
the first time...

00:35:50.047 --> 00:35:51.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:35:51.115 --> 00:35:51.983 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...what
is, then, the effect?

00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:53.518 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Unbelievable.

00:35:53.518 --> 00:35:57.088 align:middle line:84%
Because as I tell people to
release that first incident

00:35:57.088 --> 00:36:00.558 align:middle line:84%
when -- in the womb or as a
child or as a young adult,

00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:04.395 align:middle line:84%
and then I use the words and
every incident thereafter

00:36:04.395 --> 00:36:07.265 align:middle line:84%
that may trigger a similar
or probable condition

00:36:07.265 --> 00:36:10.368 align:middle line:84%
or has ever happened to you,
you're now prepared to release

00:36:10.368 --> 00:36:11.502 align:middle line:90%
that anger now and forever.

00:36:11.502 --> 00:36:13.471 align:middle line:84%
But you'll retain the
learnings of which,

00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:16.107 align:middle line:84%
in case some similar situation
where someone's attacked you,

00:36:16.107 --> 00:36:18.509 align:middle line:84%
you're resourceful, but
you're more resourceful now

00:36:18.509 --> 00:36:22.480 align:middle line:84%
because you're not engaged with
this unresourceful emotion,

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.816 align:middle line:84%
such as anger or fear or
guilt or sadness or jealousy.

00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:29.854 align:middle line:84%
So when you do this, now you
have resourceful emotions

00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:32.657 align:middle line:84%
and it's ongoing and
-- it's not permanent.

00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:33.824 align:middle line:90%
It's like cleaning house.

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:34.592 align:middle line:90%
You do it.

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:35.626 align:middle line:90%
You clear up some things,

00:36:35.626 --> 00:36:37.128 align:middle line:84%
and then some new
challenges come up.

00:36:37.128 --> 00:36:39.463 align:middle line:84%
Maybe come see a good
timeline therapist or read some

00:36:39.463 --> 00:36:42.400 align:middle line:84%
of my books or tapes or
videos and reengage it

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.102 align:middle line:84%
and you'll rerelease it and
you'll -- just like the scripts.

00:36:45.102 --> 00:36:46.437 align:middle line:90%
If you find yourself falling off

00:36:46.437 --> 00:36:48.039 align:middle line:84%
after you've gotten
great results,

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:49.407 align:middle line:84%
make sure you read
the scripts again,

00:36:49.407 --> 00:36:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and choose which scripts fall
into your category you want.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:54.645 align:middle line:84%
Because I have over 60
scripts right now online

00:36:54.645 --> 00:36:55.580 align:middle line:90%
that are available.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:56.714 align:middle line:84%
And then, in our
coaching program,

00:36:56.714 --> 00:36:58.249 align:middle line:84%
more advanced scripts
are available as well.

00:36:58.249 --> 00:37:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So people can do this by
accessing the unconscious mind

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:05.756 align:middle line:84%
at the root cause at which
these conditions occur,

00:37:05.756 --> 00:37:09.160 align:middle line:84%
which then liberates the body
emotionally and physically.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:13.431 align:middle line:84%
And there's no value in hanging
onto guilt or worry or hate.

00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:14.332 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No value.

00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:15.099 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: No value.

00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.168 align:middle line:84%
So I want to talk about
some of the scripts.

00:37:17.168 --> 00:37:18.569 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we -- I chose that one

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:20.204 align:middle line:84%
because increasing energy
is something that...

00:37:20.204 --> 00:37:21.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...at one time or
another,

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.608 align:middle line:84%
almost every human being wants
to do.

00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:24.108 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: I read only
half of the script.

00:37:24.108 --> 00:37:24.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:37:24.775 --> 00:37:25.910 align:middle line:90%
It was just a little bit.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:26.978 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: But there's
some more exciting stuff.

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:27.478 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But you get
a feel for the flavor...

00:37:27.478 --> 00:37:28.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:28.846 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: ...of it.

00:37:28.846 --> 00:37:30.081 align:middle line:90%
And also, I didn't want to go

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:31.949 align:middle line:84%
into a hypnotic state while
I had to do my job here.

00:37:31.949 --> 00:37:34.719 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the inspiration

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:36.020 align:middle line:90%
for some of these scripts.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:39.624 align:middle line:84%
Because one of them I chose
was -- it was interesting.

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:42.660 align:middle line:84%
It's really big, even though
it looks like it might not be.

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:46.197 align:middle line:84%
And that is stop
gossiping and complaining.

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:47.598 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:37:47.598 --> 00:37:49.166 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's talk about you
have noticed with your clients.

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Just the traits of gossiping and
complaining, what that is doing

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.372 align:middle line:84%
to the quality of
that person's life.

00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:56.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Think about someone
who is either close to you

00:37:56.474 --> 00:37:58.275 align:middle line:84%
or a family member,
and we've just grown

00:37:58.275 --> 00:38:00.878 align:middle line:84%
to accept their gossip,
their complaining,

00:38:00.878 --> 00:38:02.613 align:middle line:90%
and worse, their blaming.

00:38:02.613 --> 00:38:05.883 align:middle line:84%
You see, the moment you blame
someone else for your problems,

00:38:05.883 --> 00:38:08.919 align:middle line:84%
you're no longer in control of
that emotion or your actions,

00:38:08.919 --> 00:38:11.989 align:middle line:84%
and you've given permission to
just continue that behavior.

00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:14.425 align:middle line:84%
So I consider gossip,
complaining,

00:38:14.425 --> 00:38:17.094 align:middle line:84%
and blaming in a
similar category.

00:38:17.094 --> 00:38:19.897 align:middle line:84%
There's an other script for
blaming, but within the script,

00:38:19.897 --> 00:38:23.434 align:middle line:84%
it's mentioned as this is
an unresourceful emotion

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:25.036 align:middle line:84%
and in it's place,
I'm going to look

00:38:25.036 --> 00:38:27.705 align:middle line:84%
for the most positive
attributes of that person.

00:38:27.705 --> 00:38:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to think about,
even though I'm challenged

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.576 align:middle line:84%
with this person right now,
I'm going to let it go.

00:38:32.576 --> 00:38:36.547 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to smile and take
a breath and let it go.

00:38:36.547 --> 00:38:38.816 align:middle line:84%
And every morning, what I tell
people, when you're taking

00:38:38.816 --> 00:38:42.753 align:middle line:84%
that shower, as the water
touches your body, I'm cleansing

00:38:42.753 --> 00:38:45.589 align:middle line:84%
and releasing myself of
the tendency to gossip

00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:47.458 align:middle line:90%
and blame and complain.

00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:51.929 align:middle line:84%
And as I cleanse my body, I'm
fully engaged with the harmony

00:38:51.929 --> 00:38:53.998 align:middle line:84%
of the planet and
with other people.

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:56.233 align:middle line:84%
And even though they may
be different than me,

00:38:56.233 --> 00:39:00.471 align:middle line:84%
I grow to accept them and
love them, and maybe not spend

00:39:00.471 --> 00:39:02.773 align:middle line:84%
as much time with them, because
maybe they're triggering too

00:39:02.773 --> 00:39:05.609 align:middle line:84%
many things for you, but I'm
now in a resourceful state.

00:39:05.609 --> 00:39:06.944 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And there's
no resonance.

00:39:06.944 --> 00:39:08.112 align:middle line:84%
It might just be there's no
resonance with that person.

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:09.313 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: That's right.

00:39:09.313 --> 00:39:10.147 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You don't need
to hang out with them.

00:39:10.147 --> 00:39:11.549 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: You don't need to.

00:39:11.549 --> 00:39:12.483 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And also, the whole
notion about blaming and then,

00:39:12.483 --> 00:39:14.051 align:middle line:84%
basically shifting
responsibility

00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:16.554 align:middle line:84%
for whatever's occurred in
your life to another person,

00:39:16.554 --> 00:39:20.758 align:middle line:84%
is it's dangling out there as
a very chaotic field with...

00:39:20.758 --> 00:39:21.759 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:22.693 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...and
a very unreliable

00:39:22.693 --> 00:39:24.495 align:middle line:90%
and probably negative outcome.

00:39:24.495 --> 00:39:25.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:26.063 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:26.063 --> 00:39:27.064 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: You know?

00:39:27.064 --> 00:39:29.166 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: It's
tough, because it's --

00:39:29.166 --> 00:39:32.536 align:middle line:84%
we as humans, even with
the infinite knowledge

00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:38.142 align:middle line:84%
that we can access, it's
something that in a moment

00:39:38.142 --> 00:39:41.345 align:middle line:84%
of weakness, it's probably
easier for us to say, well,

00:39:41.345 --> 00:39:45.649 align:middle line:84%
I can blame the government
or society or my boss

00:39:45.649 --> 00:39:50.354 align:middle line:84%
or my girlfriend or
my husband or my kids.

00:39:50.354 --> 00:39:52.189 align:middle line:90%
But where's your responsibility?

00:39:52.189 --> 00:39:53.557 align:middle line:90%
At some point, you come to terms

00:39:53.557 --> 00:39:55.926 align:middle line:84%
with if I take full
responsibility.

00:39:55.926 --> 00:39:58.329 align:middle line:84%
I remember in our classes
in timeline therapy,

00:39:58.329 --> 00:40:01.932 align:middle line:84%
the professor was challenged
and we asked, Dr. James,

00:40:01.932 --> 00:40:03.701 align:middle line:90%
how can you take responsibility

00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:06.504 align:middle line:84%
for someone rear ending
me in an accident?

00:40:06.504 --> 00:40:09.173 align:middle line:84%
I can't possibly
have controlled that.

00:40:09.173 --> 00:40:10.474 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:40:10.474 --> 00:40:11.809 align:middle line:90%
What did you bring about?

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:13.344 align:middle line:84%
Was there something
leading up to --

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:14.812 align:middle line:90%
just prior to that accident?

00:40:14.812 --> 00:40:17.114 align:middle line:84%
You weren't being
an aware driver.

00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:18.716 align:middle line:84%
You weren't looking in
the rearview mirror.

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.251 align:middle line:84%
You weren't paying
attention to the traffic.

00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:23.754 align:middle line:84%
Something was going on in your
life that you did manifest.

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:26.423 align:middle line:84%
Stop blaming every
incident and condition

00:40:26.423 --> 00:40:28.092 align:middle line:90%
and situation, every incident.

00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:30.694 align:middle line:84%
The moment you take
responsibility,

00:40:30.694 --> 00:40:32.763 align:middle line:84%
you can improve upon
that situation.

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:33.597 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:40:33.597 --> 00:40:35.199 align:middle line:90%
It's so much more empowering.

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:36.300 align:middle line:90%
Now, another one you talk

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.603 align:middle line:84%
about in here is having
faith in the divine.

00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:40.438 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:41.839 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Now, a lot of people

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:44.575 align:middle line:84%
that are watching this show are
comfortable with that notion.

00:40:44.575 --> 00:40:45.976 align:middle line:90%
But on the other hand,

00:40:45.976 --> 00:40:49.013 align:middle line:84%
have a fear that they're still
alone somehow in this universe.

00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:49.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:40:49.847 --> 00:40:50.948 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And bridging that gap

00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:53.784 align:middle line:84%
to understand not only
you're not alone --

00:40:53.784 --> 00:40:56.353 align:middle line:84%
if you could even see what's
interpenetrating this space,

00:40:56.353 --> 00:40:58.722 align:middle line:84%
you'd probably have a being
sitting right on you [laughter],

00:40:58.722 --> 00:41:00.257 align:middle line:90%
and helpful ones at that.

00:41:00.257 --> 00:41:00.758 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:01.458 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: To say, yeah.

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:04.195 align:middle line:84%
To say nothing of these divine
imprints you're talking about.

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:06.263 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that a little bit.

00:41:06.263 --> 00:41:08.299 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: I think --
you look at the salmon

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:09.900 align:middle line:90%
and how they swim up stream.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:13.204 align:middle line:84%
And you look at butterflies, how
they return to certain places

00:41:13.204 --> 00:41:15.339 align:middle line:84%
that no one could have
ever told them where to go.

00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:19.210 align:middle line:84%
There's some infinite knowledge
and wisdom within every cell

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:22.513 align:middle line:84%
in every animal and
human and plant.

00:41:22.513 --> 00:41:25.015 align:middle line:84%
That's going a little far, Nick,
plants, but, you know.

00:41:25.015 --> 00:41:26.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: You know, I agree.

00:41:26.016 --> 00:41:27.117 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's been proven.

00:41:27.117 --> 00:41:27.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:41:27.785 --> 00:41:28.485 align:middle line:90%
So there's maybe...

00:41:28.485 --> 00:41:29.787 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:41:29.787 --> 00:41:31.088 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...there's maybe
seasonal things going on,

00:41:31.088 --> 00:41:35.025 align:middle line:84%
and the moon changes, and
the Earth and the spin.

00:41:35.025 --> 00:41:38.395 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is that there
is something that we have

00:41:38.395 --> 00:41:39.830 align:middle line:90%
to agree is infinite wisdom.

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:43.667 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not so -- such a person
that would ignore eclectic.

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:45.035 align:middle line:90%
You know, there could be room

00:41:45.035 --> 00:41:47.438 align:middle line:84%
for every type of
religious belief.

00:41:47.438 --> 00:41:50.541 align:middle line:84%
It may be that there's
something that we all,

00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:52.343 align:middle line:90%
in the moment of being one.

00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:56.647 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, being one occurs
in certain times of our life.

00:41:56.647 --> 00:41:59.049 align:middle line:84%
Some people feel it's
highly spiritual in a moment

00:41:59.049 --> 00:42:00.951 align:middle line:90%
of intimacy and love and sex.

00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:04.255 align:middle line:84%
Some people feel when they're
eating a tasty strawberry,

00:42:04.255 --> 00:42:06.957 align:middle line:84%
that moment of gustatory
and the smell and the taste

00:42:06.957 --> 00:42:08.058 align:middle line:90%
and they're in that moment.

00:42:08.058 --> 00:42:10.794 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it is
about living now

00:42:10.794 --> 00:42:13.831 align:middle line:84%
and in the moment might help
you to get more in touch

00:42:13.831 --> 00:42:15.966 align:middle line:90%
with being the vibrant and alive

00:42:15.966 --> 00:42:18.168 align:middle line:84%
and the infinite
person that you are.

00:42:18.168 --> 00:42:22.640 align:middle line:84%
I think that no one can explain
now, or will ever be able to,

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.976 align:middle line:84%
what transitions when
our time has come.

00:42:25.976 --> 00:42:29.980 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe, as some people
have experienced the other side

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.883 align:middle line:84%
and/or have been present in
people who have transitioned,

00:42:32.883 --> 00:42:36.554 align:middle line:84%
there's something going on that
ties us all spiritually back

00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:37.922 align:middle line:90%
and into one.

00:42:37.922 --> 00:42:41.392 align:middle line:84%
So whether you believe it or
not, these scripts are helpful.

00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:43.694 align:middle line:84%
They help us to be
more present and alive

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:46.330 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy our lives now
and not say, well, look.

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:48.032 align:middle line:84%
Some day, when I go
to that other side,

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:49.333 align:middle line:90%
my life will be better.

00:42:49.333 --> 00:42:50.701 align:middle line:90%
Why would you do that?

00:42:50.701 --> 00:42:53.504 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I hear this a lot,
especially among my friends

00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:57.007 align:middle line:84%
who are spiritually
oriented, which is, you know,

00:42:57.007 --> 00:42:58.676 align:middle line:90%
I've had it with this planet.

00:42:58.676 --> 00:42:59.343 align:middle line:90%
I've had it.

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:00.544 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:43:00.544 --> 00:43:02.212 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I'm ready to
move on to the other side.

00:43:02.212 --> 00:43:05.082 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always saying, "And
what will you do there?"

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:06.417 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:07.051 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What are you going
to do when you get there?

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:07.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:09.353 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I think
people don't --

00:43:09.353 --> 00:43:12.623 align:middle line:84%
unless you've made it a study,
there's some beautiful work

00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:16.160 align:middle line:84%
on this by Dr. Amit Goswami,
by the way, one of his books

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.761 align:middle line:90%
on the physics of the soul.

00:43:17.761 --> 00:43:20.064 align:middle line:84%
It gets for people who
need the empirical --

00:43:20.064 --> 00:43:22.833 align:middle line:84%
not just empirical evidence,
but also scientific evidence...

00:43:22.833 --> 00:43:23.901 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:25.169 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...it really
brings it together

00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:29.173 align:middle line:84%
in understanding there really
is not an escape per se.

00:43:29.173 --> 00:43:31.909 align:middle line:84%
The best we can do is
the best wherever we are,

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:33.944 align:middle line:84%
whether we're here or
we've left the body

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:37.314 align:middle line:84%
and we're refreshing ourselves
for whatever, whether it's

00:43:37.314 --> 00:43:39.383 align:middle line:84%
to come back, depending
on your belief system.

00:43:39.383 --> 00:43:40.217 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:43:40.217 --> 00:43:41.552 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And he is saying --

00:43:41.552 --> 00:43:43.387 align:middle line:84%
one thing that was really
interesting to me about that,

00:43:43.387 --> 00:43:48.158 align:middle line:84%
is that when you're out of this
field and this physical reality,

00:43:48.158 --> 00:43:51.562 align:middle line:84%
which is here for learning,
accomplishing, doing,

00:43:51.562 --> 00:43:54.431 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, you're in a
field of simple potential

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:57.201 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't have the
ability to create the outcomes

00:43:57.201 --> 00:43:59.770 align:middle line:84%
in the same way that we
have right here; now.

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:02.806 align:middle line:84%
This is where the fast
track learning is.

00:44:02.806 --> 00:44:03.941 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Part of laser-focused
concentration is being

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:08.245 align:middle line:90%
in the now and in the moment.

00:44:08.245 --> 00:44:10.347 align:middle line:84%
And as you read the
scripts, you'll begin

00:44:10.347 --> 00:44:13.951 align:middle line:84%
to find yourself manifesting
your dreams into reality.

00:44:13.951 --> 00:44:17.588 align:middle line:84%
And I think that whether you
accomplish the loftiest goal is

00:44:17.588 --> 00:44:18.989 align:middle line:90%
not what it's about.

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:20.824 align:middle line:84%
It's not, "I have a better car
than you" or "I have more money

00:44:20.824 --> 00:44:25.162 align:middle line:84%
than you", it's how at peace
are you with your spirit,

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:29.066 align:middle line:84%
and how you are with the
universe and your kids

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:32.736 align:middle line:84%
and your family, and how
many lives can you touch,

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:35.606 align:middle line:84%
that inspired them to
be their very best?

00:44:35.606 --> 00:44:38.609 align:middle line:84%
As a teacher and a
mentor, and as an orator,

00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:42.012 align:middle line:84%
I love to use the words
charismatic, enthusiasm,

00:44:42.012 --> 00:44:45.182 align:middle line:84%
and joy before I ever
step on set or on stage,

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:47.151 align:middle line:84%
because there's things
that can pull me down.

00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:49.520 align:middle line:84%
There's thoughts and challenges
and, you know, just before I go

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.688 align:middle line:90%
on stage, oh, someone ran

00:44:50.688 --> 00:44:52.289 align:middle line:84%
into your car and,
you know, da da da.

00:44:52.289 --> 00:44:55.292 align:middle line:84%
And someone stole
something from your house.

00:44:55.292 --> 00:44:57.828 align:middle line:90%
And I'm there for those people.

00:44:57.828 --> 00:44:59.229 align:middle line:90%
I'm there and present.

00:44:59.229 --> 00:45:01.465 align:middle line:84%
The more people learn to become
present, and there's a script

00:45:01.465 --> 00:45:03.934 align:middle line:84%
for this, in the
presence of that person,

00:45:03.934 --> 00:45:05.736 align:middle line:84%
and paying attention,
not on their cellphone

00:45:05.736 --> 00:45:07.871 align:middle line:90%
and texting and this and that.

00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:09.807 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing that maybe
you're texting to --

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:11.775 align:middle line:84%
because you're en route
and you're going to be late

00:45:11.775 --> 00:45:13.177 align:middle line:84%
for a meeting and
you're talking.

00:45:13.177 --> 00:45:15.045 align:middle line:84%
You explain to them, listen, I'm
making sure we're going to be

00:45:15.045 --> 00:45:16.080 align:middle line:90%
on time for this meeting.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.381 align:middle line:90%
I'm letting them know.

00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:19.583 align:middle line:84%
We got the make the plane
and the car has to show up.

00:45:19.583 --> 00:45:21.151 align:middle line:90%
But be present.

00:45:21.151 --> 00:45:23.187 align:middle line:84%
Look them in eyes, or in
their culture, maybe you have

00:45:23.187 --> 00:45:25.089 align:middle line:84%
to look away a little
bit at times.

00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:28.659 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're feeling, they're
kinesthetic, or they're visual.

00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:30.894 align:middle line:84%
Learn their love
language as well.

00:45:30.894 --> 00:45:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Learn what it takes
to communicate

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:33.864 align:middle line:90%
with that other person.

00:45:33.864 --> 00:45:35.833 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise,
you'll say, "I love you."

00:45:35.833 --> 00:45:36.800 align:middle line:90%
"Well, he never holds me.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.601 align:middle line:90%
He never hugs me.

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:39.136 align:middle line:90%
He says he loves me."

00:45:39.136 --> 00:45:42.372 align:middle line:84%
And she -- for him, it's I
need to hear it and she needs

00:45:42.372 --> 00:45:44.241 align:middle line:90%
to be held, or vice-versa.

00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:44.942 align:middle line:90%
I want a gift.

00:45:44.942 --> 00:45:45.776 align:middle line:90%
I want you to clean up.

00:45:45.776 --> 00:45:47.010 align:middle line:90%
I want you to look sharp.

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:49.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, visual, and
talk, and make it exciting.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.349 align:middle line:84%
So we all have languages
that we can speak better

00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:56.120 align:middle line:84%
to our teenagers, better to our
kids, better to our teachers

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.223 align:middle line:84%
and our mentors, and better
to those we want to inspire.

00:45:59.223 --> 00:46:00.491 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You just
mentioned kids.

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:01.825 align:middle line:90%
And it's not kids.

00:46:01.825 --> 00:46:03.227 align:middle line:90%
It's us, too, now.

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:05.963 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I see senior citizens
texting while they're driving.

00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:08.499 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, we're
in this cyber society.

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:10.834 align:middle line:84%
The very thing you just talked
about, because you're talking

00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:14.271 align:middle line:84%
about presence, you're talking
about awareness of others

00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:15.305 align:middle line:90%
and your surroundings.

00:46:15.305 --> 00:46:16.006 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:46:16.006 --> 00:46:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Connection.

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.041 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:46:18.041 --> 00:46:18.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We'll talk about
some of the other scripts

00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:20.177 align:middle line:90%
on connection in a minute.

00:46:20.177 --> 00:46:24.481 align:middle line:84%
But how does this all factor
in with a cyber society?

00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:28.385 align:middle line:84%
Other than that you can put that
on your iPhone or your Android

00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:32.022 align:middle line:84%
and listen to these scripts,
how does that figure into all

00:46:32.022 --> 00:46:34.658 align:middle line:84%
of this when we're
so not present?

00:46:34.658 --> 00:46:36.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You know, I
learned a long time ago

00:46:36.326 --> 00:46:39.396 align:middle line:84%
that if I was going to
communicate with my kids better,

00:46:39.396 --> 00:46:41.532 align:middle line:90%
or significant other, I had

00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:44.301 align:middle line:84%
to learn what was their
desired form of connection.

00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:47.838 align:middle line:84%
Maybe for them, a text
initially was appropriate.

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:49.573 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
about the human voice...

00:46:49.573 --> 00:46:50.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:46:50.908 --> 00:46:51.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...that transmits
something very important.

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:53.944 align:middle line:84%
So maybe just --
for them, you Skype.

00:46:53.944 --> 00:46:55.045 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they want the visual.

00:46:55.045 --> 00:46:56.246 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they don't.

00:46:56.246 --> 00:46:57.714 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they just want to
be on the phone with you.

00:46:57.714 --> 00:47:02.586 align:middle line:84%
Don't depend on long texts and
creating all this, you know.

00:47:02.586 --> 00:47:03.153 align:middle line:90%
Say, look.

00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:04.421 align:middle line:90%
I'll be there.

00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:05.756 align:middle line:84%
I'm late. I'm a half hour,
but wait till I get there.

00:47:05.756 --> 00:47:07.891 align:middle line:84%
En route, you can talk
to them on the phone.

00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:09.426 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you can
when you get there.

00:47:09.426 --> 00:47:12.029 align:middle line:84%
You're eye-to-eye, or if you
can't be eye-to-eye, you know,

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:14.698 align:middle line:84%
use Skype or use Google
Chat or something.

00:47:14.698 --> 00:47:16.099 align:middle line:84%
There's all these
marvelous things

00:47:16.099 --> 00:47:20.537 align:middle line:84%
that cyberspace now offers,
but learn how to be present

00:47:20.537 --> 00:47:22.339 align:middle line:90%
with those other people.

00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:24.775 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've seen these Google
Chat things where people are,

00:47:24.775 --> 00:47:25.809 align:middle line:84%
you know, they're
looking and talking

00:47:25.809 --> 00:47:26.743 align:middle line:90%
to each other right in the eye.

00:47:26.743 --> 00:47:27.945 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, wow.

00:47:27.945 --> 00:47:29.880 align:middle line:84%
It seems like they're
present, and they can be.

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:30.681 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:31.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: And that's okay.

00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:33.116 align:middle line:90%
So make sure.

00:47:33.116 --> 00:47:34.985 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I'm not talking about
the bumping around, you know,

00:47:34.985 --> 00:47:36.653 align:middle line:84%
teenagers that are
texting each other

00:47:36.653 --> 00:47:38.188 align:middle line:84%
when they're standing
next to each other.

00:47:38.188 --> 00:47:39.323 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:47:39.323 --> 00:47:40.257 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: There's this
humanistic disconnect

00:47:40.257 --> 00:47:40.991 align:middle line:90%
that is going on.

00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:41.491 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:47:41.491 --> 00:47:42.659 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Yeah.

00:47:42.659 --> 00:47:44.728 align:middle line:90%
Love is a very special thing.

00:47:44.728 --> 00:47:48.131 align:middle line:84%
And intimacy and love and
caring is something that --

00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:50.334 align:middle line:84%
I think that it starts
with every person.

00:47:50.334 --> 00:47:53.503 align:middle line:84%
And every person that
learns to bring joy and love

00:47:53.503 --> 00:47:56.306 align:middle line:84%
into their life, and not
this mushy thing where --

00:47:56.306 --> 00:47:58.575 align:middle line:84%
and all the stress and, you
know, your garage is burning

00:47:58.575 --> 00:47:59.409 align:middle line:90%
down and you're ignoring it.

00:47:59.409 --> 00:48:01.011 align:middle line:90%
You're sitting there meditating.

00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:02.112 align:middle line:90%
You got to take action.

00:48:02.112 --> 00:48:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.047 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You've got --
stress is good, actually.

00:48:04.047 --> 00:48:05.015 align:middle line:90%
I have to say this.

00:48:05.015 --> 00:48:05.782 align:middle line:90%
Because you know what?

00:48:05.782 --> 00:48:06.783 align:middle line:90%
The most successful people

00:48:06.783 --> 00:48:09.753 align:middle line:84%
in history have endured
massive amounts

00:48:09.753 --> 00:48:11.488 align:middle line:90%
of stress, but they adjusted.

00:48:11.488 --> 00:48:15.092 align:middle line:84%
They either endured or made
new changes in their life.

00:48:15.092 --> 00:48:16.360 align:middle line:90%
And maybe that's what it took.

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.629 align:middle line:84%
It reached this boiling point
before they can even get

00:48:18.629 --> 00:48:19.630 align:middle line:90%
themselves to change.

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:20.764 align:middle line:90%
Don't wait for that.

00:48:20.764 --> 00:48:23.767 align:middle line:84%
Start changing now, by
one person at a time,

00:48:23.767 --> 00:48:24.668 align:middle line:90%
one situation at a time.

00:48:24.668 --> 00:48:26.236 align:middle line:90%
Start with yourself, though.

00:48:26.236 --> 00:48:26.737 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:28.071 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:48:28.071 --> 00:48:29.473 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Don't -- stop
complaining about everyone else.

00:48:29.473 --> 00:48:30.741 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well -- and there's
another element to this, too.

00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:33.243 align:middle line:84%
A number of years ago, I
interviewed Dr. John Demartini

00:48:33.243 --> 00:48:37.214 align:middle line:84%
and one -- that conversation was
about the hierarchy of values.

00:48:37.214 --> 00:48:38.348 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:48:38.348 --> 00:48:39.149 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because you
have all these, I mean,

00:48:39.149 --> 00:48:40.751 align:middle line:90%
these are wonderful scripts,

00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:43.553 align:middle line:84%
and they're made really
available, which I love.

00:48:43.553 --> 00:48:49.526 align:middle line:84%
But if you're lying to yourself
about your own system of values,

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:51.895 align:middle line:84%
they're still not really
going to work for you.

00:48:51.895 --> 00:48:53.430 align:middle line:90%
If you're saying, I want a --

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.165 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned this in the
beginning of the show.

00:48:55.165 --> 00:48:58.468 align:middle line:84%
I want to make $250,000 a
year, and right now you --

00:48:58.468 --> 00:49:00.170 align:middle line:84%
maybe you have very
limited skills.

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And in reality, what you
really want is to be there

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.575 align:middle line:84%
for your kids or
your grandkids, say.

00:49:05.575 --> 00:49:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:07.044 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: If you're a woman.

00:49:07.044 --> 00:49:08.412 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:49:08.412 --> 00:49:09.246 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But you're tired
of being broke, so it's like,

00:49:09.246 --> 00:49:10.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing this script on money.

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.883 align:middle line:84%
And so -- and it's not
that it's not appropriate,

00:49:12.883 --> 00:49:18.722 align:middle line:84%
but what happens when you don't
acknowledge your genuine values,

00:49:18.722 --> 00:49:21.925 align:middle line:84%
the -- in your -- because you've
got a lot of scripts there.

00:49:21.925 --> 00:49:24.928 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how you
pair up values with scripts.

00:49:24.928 --> 00:49:25.996 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:49:25.996 --> 00:49:28.131 align:middle line:84%
Ben Franklin was a
master at knowing how

00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:30.701 align:middle line:84%
to utilize every
minute of his life.

00:49:30.701 --> 00:49:33.203 align:middle line:84%
And he would write
out, and this is good;

00:49:33.203 --> 00:49:34.404 align:middle line:90%
journaling, writing out.

00:49:34.404 --> 00:49:36.506 align:middle line:84%
What are your highest
goals and dreams?

00:49:36.506 --> 00:49:38.675 align:middle line:84%
And then, manifest them is
what we're talking about.

00:49:38.675 --> 00:49:40.777 align:middle line:90%
So I think one of the challenges

00:49:40.777 --> 00:49:43.880 align:middle line:84%
that people have today is
they think that, you know,

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:47.551 align:middle line:84%
in a goal-driven society, if
they don't get that special job

00:49:47.551 --> 00:49:50.687 align:middle line:84%
or that, you know, that, you
know, situation or that income,

00:49:50.687 --> 00:49:51.788 align:middle line:90%
that they've somehow failed.

00:49:51.788 --> 00:49:53.056 align:middle line:90%
No. They haven't.

00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:55.092 align:middle line:84%
What they haven't done is
they haven't accessed the

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:56.493 align:middle line:90%
right people.

00:49:56.493 --> 00:49:59.296 align:middle line:84%
They haven't put themselves in
the work demand or situation.

00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:02.566 align:middle line:84%
They haven't brought themselves
to a higher order of capability.

00:50:02.566 --> 00:50:07.237 align:middle line:84%
So each person, to be the very
best employee or president

00:50:07.237 --> 00:50:12.109 align:middle line:84%
or manager, has to be that
person that is absolutely --

00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:14.711 align:middle line:84%
has a skill set that
matches everything

00:50:14.711 --> 00:50:15.912 align:middle line:90%
that they know they can do.

00:50:15.912 --> 00:50:17.848 align:middle line:84%
So values, you're
absolutely right.

00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:19.616 align:middle line:90%
It might couples in conflict.

00:50:19.616 --> 00:50:21.018 align:middle line:90%
They're going, look.

00:50:21.018 --> 00:50:23.320 align:middle line:84%
I need security, but we're going
to go for a three-week vacation.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.622 align:middle line:84%
Well, during that three-week
vacation, I'm not earning money

00:50:25.622 --> 00:50:26.456 align:middle line:90%
and what am I going to do?

00:50:26.456 --> 00:50:27.391 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And you're worried

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:28.458 align:middle line:84%
about money during
the three weeks.

00:50:28.458 --> 00:50:29.292 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And you're
worried about it.

00:50:29.292 --> 00:50:30.293 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to Brazil with my kids

00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:31.995 align:middle line:84%
for three weeks starting
December 31st.

00:50:31.995 --> 00:50:33.029 align:middle line:90%
Literally going.

00:50:33.029 --> 00:50:35.632 align:middle line:84%
And I look forward
to it, and trust me,

00:50:35.632 --> 00:50:37.868 align:middle line:84%
like Zig Ziglar once
said, trust me.

00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:40.804 align:middle line:84%
Since in a week and a half, I'm
going to be gone and away from,

00:50:40.804 --> 00:50:42.839 align:middle line:84%
you know, managing and
phones and this and that.

00:50:42.839 --> 00:50:46.143 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do everything I
can in the next week and a half

00:50:46.143 --> 00:50:48.011 align:middle line:90%
and get it done so I'm away

00:50:48.011 --> 00:50:50.781 align:middle line:84%
and enjoying my vacation
so I'm present.

00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:55.385 align:middle line:84%
So really, as Zig once
said, pretend you're going

00:50:55.385 --> 00:50:58.722 align:middle line:84%
to Acapulco tomorrow and
you've got to get everything

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:00.657 align:middle line:84%
in your life in order
and ready and done.

00:51:00.657 --> 00:51:03.326 align:middle line:84%
And so, each day is at a
very fast pace, rapid pace,

00:51:03.326 --> 00:51:05.862 align:middle line:84%
but congenial and
happy and enthusiastic

00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:09.966 align:middle line:84%
so that every day is an
opportunity to go on vacation.

00:51:09.966 --> 00:51:11.668 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's -- you've
mentioned this a couple

00:51:11.668 --> 00:51:14.337 align:middle line:84%
of times, surrounding yourself
with these five people.

00:51:14.337 --> 00:51:15.439 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:51:15.439 --> 00:51:17.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Go into
that a little bit more.

00:51:17.107 --> 00:51:18.208 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:19.042 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We still
have a few minutes left.

00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:19.743 align:middle line:90%
Go into that a little bit more.

00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:21.278 align:middle line:90%
That's a difficult one.

00:51:21.278 --> 00:51:23.680 align:middle line:84%
We have the people that
we've collected and gathered

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.449 align:middle line:90%
around us in our lives.

00:51:25.449 --> 00:51:27.150 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are for comfort.

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Many of them may not have very
functional lives themselves,

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.455 align:middle line:90%
say.

00:51:31.455 --> 00:51:33.890 align:middle line:84%
But there's a heart
connection there.

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.693 align:middle line:84%
Talk about this dynamic
and where it almost seems

00:51:36.693 --> 00:51:39.062 align:middle line:84%
like it's opportunistic
or self-serving,

00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:40.764 align:middle line:84%
especially to women,
to say, well,

00:51:40.764 --> 00:51:44.434 align:middle line:84%
I can't just leave my girlfriend
behind and my girlfriends behind

00:51:44.434 --> 00:51:47.771 align:middle line:84%
and go find these other people
that have more to offer me.

00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:48.705 align:middle line:90%
Can you speak to that?

00:51:48.705 --> 00:51:49.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:51.508 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because there's
judgment about that.

00:51:51.508 --> 00:51:54.244 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: I'm thrilled because
nearly every week I'm either

00:51:54.244 --> 00:51:57.447 align:middle line:84%
going to a meet up group
that's pertinent to my goals

00:51:57.447 --> 00:51:58.615 align:middle line:90%
and values and dreams.

00:51:58.615 --> 00:52:01.151 align:middle line:84%
I'm hooking up and
learning and meeting people

00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:03.253 align:middle line:84%
that either aspire to or
they're better than me

00:52:03.253 --> 00:52:04.654 align:middle line:90%
in their particular field.

00:52:04.654 --> 00:52:07.591 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I'm attending a
lot of marketing meetings

00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:10.560 align:middle line:84%
and education and Internet
and cyberspace meetings.

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.162 align:middle line:84%
And there's always
someone out there

00:52:12.162 --> 00:52:13.497 align:middle line:90%
that has something special.

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:16.066 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, if you just
treat them with love and respect

00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:17.934 align:middle line:84%
and say, look, I really
respect what you're doing,

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:21.171 align:middle line:84%
if you just share with me how
you've become so successful.

00:52:21.171 --> 00:52:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And people that just, for some
reason, out of the deepest

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.774 align:middle line:90%
of their heart, they're excited.

00:52:24.774 --> 00:52:26.476 align:middle line:84%
They rarely get that
questioned asked.

00:52:26.476 --> 00:52:28.044 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most
successful people

00:52:28.044 --> 00:52:30.547 align:middle line:84%
around I know are earning
$40,000, $60,000 a month

00:52:30.547 --> 00:52:32.115 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like, "How
did you do it?"

00:52:32.115 --> 00:52:34.017 align:middle line:84%
And they tell me
and I'm surprised

00:52:34.017 --> 00:52:36.019 align:middle line:84%
at how few people
ask them sincerely.

00:52:36.019 --> 00:52:37.521 align:middle line:84%
Because they'll listen and
they'll kind of roll their eyes.

00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:38.922 align:middle line:84%
I can't do that,
I can't do that.

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:40.891 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean
you can't do that?

00:52:40.891 --> 00:52:42.359 align:middle line:90%
Surround yourself with people,

00:52:42.359 --> 00:52:44.594 align:middle line:84%
even if they're above
your level now.

00:52:44.594 --> 00:52:46.296 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're fitter
than you are.

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:47.998 align:middle line:84%
They're eating healthier
than you are.

00:52:47.998 --> 00:52:51.568 align:middle line:84%
They're more successful than you
are in how you define success.

00:52:51.568 --> 00:52:54.304 align:middle line:84%
Some of it's not only going
to rub off, but you're going

00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:56.973 align:middle line:84%
to then bring yourself up to
a higher vibrational level.

00:52:56.973 --> 00:53:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you'll tell your friend
that you wanted to come,

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.144 align:middle line:90%
but she wasn't ready yet.

00:53:01.144 --> 00:53:02.679 align:middle line:84%
Something in her
life wasn't ready.

00:53:02.679 --> 00:53:04.381 align:middle line:90%
So tell your girlfriend, hey.

00:53:04.381 --> 00:53:06.416 align:middle line:84%
I already benefited this,
and let me tell you why.

00:53:06.416 --> 00:53:07.684 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't about you and I.

00:53:07.684 --> 00:53:10.053 align:middle line:84%
It was about me trying
to manifest and be

00:53:10.053 --> 00:53:12.155 align:middle line:90%
who I am to be my best.

00:53:12.155 --> 00:53:14.024 align:middle line:90%
Take care of yourself first.

00:53:14.024 --> 00:53:16.493 align:middle line:84%
You can't -- you got to put
the little gas mask thing on,

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:17.561 align:middle line:84%
you know, in the
plane, you know...

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:18.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:53:18.495 --> 00:53:19.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...to
take care of --

00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:20.330 align:middle line:90%
so take care of yourself first.

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:21.531 align:middle line:84%
That's what these
scripts are about.

00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:24.134 align:middle line:84%
Focus on your goals,
your dreams, your values.

00:53:24.134 --> 00:53:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Not what you think everyone
thinks you should accomplish.

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:29.072 align:middle line:84%
And as you start finding
yourself taking action

00:53:29.072 --> 00:53:31.374 align:middle line:84%
and doing the steps, then
you're going to start thinking

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:32.943 align:middle line:84%
about all the other
people you can help.

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:37.047 align:middle line:84%
And then, your friendships will
improve, and whether they do

00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:38.415 align:middle line:84%
or not, some people
aren't ready.

00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:39.749 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: You bet.

00:53:39.749 --> 00:53:41.585 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the thing is, when
you get out of that grumbling

00:53:41.585 --> 00:53:44.354 align:middle line:84%
and grousing mode, there are
people that will drop away

00:53:44.354 --> 00:53:46.690 align:middle line:84%
from your life because that's
their connection with you.

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:47.324 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:53:47.324 --> 00:53:48.091 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right?

00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:49.125 align:middle line:90%
So you have to be willing.

00:53:49.125 --> 00:53:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You're
enabling each other.

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:50.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You're
enabling each other.

00:53:50.994 --> 00:53:52.729 align:middle line:90%
You have to be ready to let go

00:53:52.729 --> 00:53:55.065 align:middle line:84%
of some very familiar
faces that you love.

00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:56.833 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: For a while,
or forever, or not; right?

00:53:56.833 --> 00:53:58.201 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:53:58.201 --> 00:53:59.536 align:middle line:84%
And one of the areas you talked
about, you were just talking

00:53:59.536 --> 00:54:00.704 align:middle line:84%
about someone and
their girlfriend,

00:54:00.704 --> 00:54:03.306 align:middle line:84%
is you talk a lot
about intimacy.

00:54:03.306 --> 00:54:05.041 align:middle line:90%
You also talk about functioning.

00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:08.845 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have a lot of
information on your site

00:54:08.845 --> 00:54:10.780 align:middle line:90%
in terms of sexual health...

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:11.581 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:12.649 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: ...and function.

00:54:12.649 --> 00:54:14.417 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk a
little bit about that

00:54:14.417 --> 00:54:18.088 align:middle line:84%
because before we sign off here
in about five minutes or so...

00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:19.322 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:54:19.322 --> 00:54:21.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...that is an
area where people are having

00:54:21.358 --> 00:54:22.959 align:middle line:84%
so many troubles
with each other.

00:54:22.959 --> 00:54:27.263 align:middle line:84%
It's like, men and women aren't
talking to each with clarity,

00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:30.100 align:middle line:84%
or they're understanding each
other even less right now.

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.669 align:middle line:90%
It seems like it's a battlefield

00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:34.604 align:middle line:84%
between the sexes
out there right now.

00:54:34.604 --> 00:54:35.972 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:54:35.972 --> 00:54:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you have scripts
to address that, by the way.

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.108 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Absolutely.

00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:40.644 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've been
on sex panels

00:54:40.644 --> 00:54:42.712 align:middle line:84%
and a love relationship
panel with John Gray

00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:43.913 align:middle line:90%
and some luminary people.

00:54:43.913 --> 00:54:46.249 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been good
friends with these people.

00:54:46.249 --> 00:54:48.284 align:middle line:84%
And I come across in
a few different ways.

00:54:48.284 --> 00:54:53.256 align:middle line:84%
One is, the biochemical proof
is that men reach a hot point

00:54:53.256 --> 00:54:55.025 align:middle line:84%
and get excited quickly,
within two minutes,

00:54:55.025 --> 00:54:57.293 align:middle line:84%
and they literally can, you
know, can come to this state

00:54:57.293 --> 00:54:59.796 align:middle line:84%
of excitement, where
a woman need nurturing

00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:01.931 align:middle line:90%
and love and acceptance.

00:55:01.931 --> 00:55:03.500 align:middle line:90%
And there's a whole cycle that's

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.468 align:middle line:84%
about 20 minutes
to an hour behind.

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:07.337 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it actually
begins early in the day;

00:55:07.337 --> 00:55:08.972 align:middle line:90%
sending little love messages.

00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:11.574 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can send her a little
voice message and something.

00:55:11.574 --> 00:55:15.478 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it is, it's
getting here and you

00:55:15.478 --> 00:55:18.815 align:middle line:84%
in the same vibrational
state so that as you learn

00:55:18.815 --> 00:55:22.052 align:middle line:84%
to please your woman first,
and this is what my message was

00:55:22.052 --> 00:55:25.422 align:middle line:84%
to the medical doctors last
week, and it'll be uploaded soon

00:55:25.422 --> 00:55:27.624 align:middle line:90%
on our website, the actual talk.

00:55:27.624 --> 00:55:31.194 align:middle line:84%
Because it took me three hours
to explain to the doctors

00:55:31.194 --> 00:55:35.365 align:middle line:84%
that we as a society
have conditioned, due to,

00:55:35.365 --> 00:55:37.467 align:middle line:84%
I will say very bluntly,
porn and things

00:55:37.467 --> 00:55:40.603 align:middle line:84%
where men do these
things, and they think

00:55:40.603 --> 00:55:41.938 align:middle line:84%
that the woman's
being stimulated.

00:55:41.938 --> 00:55:43.506 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is,
Kinsey report,

00:55:43.506 --> 00:55:46.276 align:middle line:84%
where they analyze 900 women,
gynecologists, there's little

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:50.213 align:middle line:84%
or not nerve endings deep
into, if you will, the vagina,

00:55:50.213 --> 00:55:52.582 align:middle line:84%
and yet, 15,000 nerve
connections

00:55:52.582 --> 00:55:55.652 align:middle line:84%
and 8,000 pleasures nerves are
directly in a different area,

00:55:55.652 --> 00:55:58.555 align:middle line:84%
more on the surface,
of the female anatomy.

00:55:58.555 --> 00:55:59.689 align:middle line:90%
And men miss this.

00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:00.423 align:middle line:90%
They don't get it.

00:56:00.423 --> 00:56:01.791 align:middle line:90%
They don't know.

00:56:01.791 --> 00:56:03.626 align:middle line:84%
And then, the woman has to fake
and then the fake continues

00:56:03.626 --> 00:56:06.596 align:middle line:84%
in the relationship and
women are unsatiated.

00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:08.131 align:middle line:84%
And so, we have this
vicious cycle.

00:56:08.131 --> 00:56:10.567 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people that
you can solve that.

00:56:10.567 --> 00:56:11.935 align:middle line:90%
And one of the doctors --

00:56:11.935 --> 00:56:15.004 align:middle line:84%
one out of 31 doctors raised
their hand and did not agree,

00:56:15.004 --> 00:56:16.272 align:middle line:90%
and I heard her disagree.

00:56:16.272 --> 00:56:17.373 align:middle line:84%
Well, she said, "Well,
there's no time

00:56:17.373 --> 00:56:18.475 align:middle line:90%
for what you're talking about.

00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:20.076 align:middle line:84%
You're going to take
an hour massage

00:56:20.076 --> 00:56:21.311 align:middle line:90%
with your significant other?

00:56:21.311 --> 00:56:22.378 align:middle line:90%
You're going to romance her?

00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:23.713 align:middle line:84%
You're going to talk
to her in her ear

00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:24.481 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to do...?"

00:56:24.481 --> 00:56:25.849 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Yeah.

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:27.851 align:middle line:84%
So then, why don't you hire a
minimum wage worker, Doctor?

00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:30.220 align:middle line:84%
You have the money to hire
someone who can work for $8

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:33.256 align:middle line:84%
or $9 an hour and do all your
chores that you're doing now,

00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:35.091 align:middle line:84%
like trust, you're
wasting your time doing,

00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:37.861 align:middle line:84%
and you can spend an hour
or two of delicious time

00:56:37.861 --> 00:56:39.129 align:middle line:90%
with your significant other."

00:56:39.129 --> 00:56:40.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Even if you're
going to a movie together

00:56:40.697 --> 00:56:42.031 align:middle line:90%
and holding hands or something,

00:56:42.031 --> 00:56:44.067 align:middle line:84%
all of that is the
beginning of intimacy.

00:56:44.067 --> 00:56:45.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Sure.

00:56:45.435 --> 00:56:47.504 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And I hear so many
women that have anger issues

00:56:47.504 --> 00:56:50.740 align:middle line:84%
around the fact that they feel
like they've been just dismissed

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:54.010 align:middle line:84%
and overlooked, and all of the
things that matter to them,

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:58.515 align:middle line:84%
in favor of this fast pace,
very masculine paradigm society.

00:56:58.515 --> 00:56:59.716 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:56:59.716 --> 00:57:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: As you say,
porn has been at the base

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:01.551 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of it, and so forth.

00:57:01.551 --> 00:57:02.619 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And the
women are checking out.

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.255 align:middle line:84%
They're just saying, "I
don't need a relationship.

00:57:05.255 --> 00:57:06.356 align:middle line:90%
I can't deal with this anymore."

00:57:06.356 --> 00:57:07.524 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:57:07.524 --> 00:57:08.525 align:middle line:84%
They're going to go
shopping or eat chocolate.

00:57:08.525 --> 00:57:09.292 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's more
exciting to them.

00:57:09.292 --> 00:57:10.426 align:middle line:90%
And.

00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:11.294 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, they're
getting more out of it.

00:57:11.294 --> 00:57:11.961 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:57:11.961 --> 00:57:13.363 align:middle line:90%
They are. They are.

00:57:13.363 --> 00:57:17.167 align:middle line:84%
Because, see, again, the sensory
nerves, the libido, the energy,

00:57:17.167 --> 00:57:20.503 align:middle line:84%
the sexual psyche, it all
starts at the brain first.

00:57:20.503 --> 00:57:21.337 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:57:21.337 --> 00:57:22.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: That's where sex is.

00:57:22.305 --> 00:57:23.306 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: The brain
and the heart.

00:57:23.306 --> 00:57:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: The brain
and the heart.

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:26.676 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And men
don't quite get it

00:57:26.676 --> 00:57:29.579 align:middle line:84%
yet because they've been shunned
and then, if they approach women

00:57:29.579 --> 00:57:31.948 align:middle line:84%
who have been hurt, they
get put to the side.

00:57:31.948 --> 00:57:34.017 align:middle line:84%
And so, they have a
little a paradigm they need

00:57:34.017 --> 00:57:34.717 align:middle line:90%
to deal with as well.

00:57:34.717 --> 00:57:35.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:57:35.285 --> 00:57:36.686 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:57:36.686 --> 00:57:38.354 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: So the men and the
women in my courses are going

00:57:38.354 --> 00:57:40.490 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to really
integrate,

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:42.091 align:middle line:84%
even if they've been
married for 20 years.

00:57:42.091 --> 00:57:44.427 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or not, I've had
couples that have been married

00:57:44.427 --> 00:57:46.563 align:middle line:84%
for 20 years and the
wife will confide,

00:57:46.563 --> 00:57:49.299 align:middle line:84%
"I've never had an orgasm,
you know, except by myself

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:50.867 align:middle line:90%
by masturbation or a vibrator."

00:57:50.867 --> 00:57:52.068 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:57:52.068 --> 00:57:52.869 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And so, I
say, well, wait a minute.

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:54.137 align:middle line:90%
Let's change that paradigm.

00:57:54.137 --> 00:57:57.507 align:middle line:84%
The man can delay,
not through, you know,

00:57:57.507 --> 00:57:58.975 align:middle line:84%
thinking of baseball
cards and things,

00:57:58.975 --> 00:58:00.577 align:middle line:84%
but there's ways
to make this work.

00:58:00.577 --> 00:58:01.144 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: [Laughter]

00:58:01.144 --> 00:58:02.478 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:58:02.478 --> 00:58:03.813 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And I'm convinced
that with the proper herbs

00:58:03.813 --> 00:58:06.883 align:middle line:84%
and supplements and hormones
and energy and communication

00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:08.651 align:middle line:90%
that love is truly not dead.

00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:09.719 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: As you said early on,

00:58:09.719 --> 00:58:11.821 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter
what the situation is.

00:58:11.821 --> 00:58:12.889 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:58:12.889 --> 00:58:14.724 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Love is
the universal solvent,

00:58:14.724 --> 00:58:17.627 align:middle line:84%
as I've earned one
physics professor say.

00:58:17.627 --> 00:58:18.494 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:58:18.494 --> 00:58:19.495 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And I
agree with that.

00:58:19.495 --> 00:58:20.897 align:middle line:84%
So we have just a
minute or so left.

00:58:20.897 --> 00:58:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts on how we can
take ourselves to a new level?

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:27.036 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about a lot today.

00:58:27.036 --> 00:58:28.171 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:58:28.171 --> 00:58:31.174 align:middle line:84%
I think, consider your
physical being as one

00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:32.976 align:middle line:90%
with your emotional being,

00:58:32.976 --> 00:58:35.578 align:middle line:84%
and begin to treat
your emotional being

00:58:35.578 --> 00:58:41.284 align:middle line:84%
with the same type of do unto
others as you'd do to yourself.

00:58:41.284 --> 00:58:44.587 align:middle line:84%
And Napoleon Hill stated
very clearly, you know,

00:58:44.587 --> 00:58:47.056 align:middle line:84%
in these 15 principles
of success,

00:58:47.056 --> 00:58:51.394 align:middle line:84%
as you manifest your health and
you eat healthy and you exercise

00:58:51.394 --> 00:58:55.632 align:middle line:84%
and you drink fresh water
and you take care of those

00:58:55.632 --> 00:58:58.067 align:middle line:84%
around you and you take
care of your emotions

00:58:58.067 --> 00:58:59.802 align:middle line:90%
and incorporate these thoughts,

00:58:59.802 --> 00:59:02.405 align:middle line:84%
these beautiful thoughts
every day, it's not something

00:59:02.405 --> 00:59:04.607 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
do after six readings

00:59:04.607 --> 00:59:06.876 align:middle line:84%
and then notice this
profound difference.

00:59:06.876 --> 00:59:07.877 align:middle line:90%
You'll notice differences.

00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:09.312 align:middle line:90%
You'll notice improvements.

00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:10.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm a work in progress.

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:11.714 align:middle line:90%
We're all a work in progress.

00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:12.649 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:59:12.649 --> 00:59:13.583 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: We all
can be better,

00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:15.785 align:middle line:84%
but we're also perfect
as we are.

00:59:15.785 --> 00:59:18.588 align:middle line:84%
Accept who we are and
be in love with life.

00:59:18.588 --> 00:59:22.859 align:middle line:84%
Life is great and just go to
our site, growyoungandslim.com.

00:59:22.859 --> 00:59:23.793 align:middle line:90%
It's all doable.

00:59:23.793 --> 00:59:24.928 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I agree.

00:59:24.928 --> 00:59:26.129 align:middle line:84%
Don't assume you have
to get out of this body

00:59:26.129 --> 00:59:27.997 align:middle line:90%
to make a good experience.

00:59:27.997 --> 00:59:29.365 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: That's right.

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:31.701 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Thank you so much
for your time, and for your love

00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:33.970 align:middle line:84%
and passion and joy
and enthusiasm,

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:36.406 align:middle line:84%
about putting these scripts
together for the rest of us

00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:38.508 align:middle line:84%
to be able to basically
reach the kind

00:59:38.508 --> 00:59:40.710 align:middle line:90%
of highs you reach all the time.

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:41.544 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:42.378 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: I'm there for you.

00:59:42.378 --> 00:59:43.546 align:middle line:90%
We're going to make this happen.

00:59:43.546 --> 00:59:44.781 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:46.683 align:middle line:84%
There are many ways to
break patterns of thinking,

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:49.385 align:middle line:84%
but Nick's are amazing
direct and accessible.

00:59:49.385 --> 00:59:50.586 align:middle line:90%
Definitely worth a try.

00:59:50.586 --> 00:59:52.322 align:middle line:84%
You can find these
scripts on his website,

and then click on motivational.

00:59:57.093 --> 01:00:00.330 align:middle line:84%
You'll find a wealth of other
