00:00:19.573 --> 00:00:21.990 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Jerry Wills
has become such an audience

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.230 align:middle line:10%
and personal favorite that
I've begun calling him JerBear.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Recently, we were
in a conversation

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.030 align:middle line:84%
about his adventures in research
in Bigfoot country, the Pacific

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.030 align:middle line:90%
Northwest.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.540 align:middle line:84%
But as he and his wife Kathy
were putting the pieces

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.045 align:middle line:84%
together, a completely
different story began emerging,

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to share
that with you today.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And it is fascinating,
because we

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.050 align:middle line:84%
tend to think of these as
isolated events, although we

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.170 align:middle line:90%
know there are clusters.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows
Sasquatch viewing is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.500 align:middle line:84%
going to be best up in
the Pacific Northwest,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.600 align:middle line:84%
if you ever have the possibility
to have an encounter, right?

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.780 align:middle line:84%
But you saw something
else completely.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.530 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, you
intrigued me on the phone.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.930 align:middle line:84%
We were talking privately a
couple weeks ago that something

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.310 align:middle line:90%
bigger than Bigfoot.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.293 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:06.293 --> 00:01:07.710 align:middle line:10%
>>JERRY WILLS:
Well, what happened

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.650 align:middle line:10%
is that while we were in
the Pacific Northwest,

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.830 align:middle line:10%
we were wondering why there?

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we'd
never been there.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So going to that area,
it became pretty obvious.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.070 align:middle line:90%
It's heavily forested mountains.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.770 align:middle line:10%
Plenty of opportunity
for something

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:10%
this size and this
enigmatic to go and just

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.380 align:middle line:10%
disappear into the woods.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:84%
So then we started talking
to some of the folks,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.180 align:middle line:84%
and some of the things we
heard were just extraordinary.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.420 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just seeing
them but seeing

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.640 align:middle line:90%
them appear or disappear.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And then there were some
reports of what some folks call

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.090 align:middle line:90%
cryptids or cryptoids.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.320 align:middle line:84%
These are beings that have
never been seen before on Earth,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:84%
but these folks are
saying they saw it,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.380 align:middle line:84%
for example, a large
praying mantis-like thing.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we hear
about the mantis people,

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes
they're even assigned

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.070 align:middle line:84%
to living at the
center of the Earth,

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.914 align:middle line:84%
for example, or under
the Earth's surface.

00:02:07.914 --> 00:02:08.789 align:middle line:90%
But you were seeing--

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:84%
these people are
seeing them above.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, and saying,
they were just out hunting,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.130 align:middle line:90%
and there was this thing.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And it scared them quite
badly, as it would anybody,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.110 align:middle line:90%
I would imagine.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And it would just stand
there and looking at them.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And then it turned and
walked and just disappeared.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.810 align:middle line:84%
One guy said it was a bit of a
flash and it would disappear.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Another fellow said it just sort
of faded out and disappeared.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So he wasn't sure if
he was going crazy

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.940 align:middle line:84%
or if he'd really
seen something.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
But we heard more and more
of these stories and not just

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.140 align:middle line:84%
from the residents that are
actually looking for Bigfoot.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.690 align:middle line:84%
We went to the reservations and
spoke with indigenous folks.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.480 align:middle line:84%
We figured if there's
something to it,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:84%
then there's got to be
a history about this

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.890 align:middle line:84%
that goes far beyond
when, quote, unquote,

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.310 align:middle line:84%
white people showed up in this
area and started occupying it.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, it
went back to the point,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.890 align:middle line:84%
from what we were told,
that these beings were

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.150 align:middle line:84%
there long before there
were ever any people there.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.400 align:middle line:90%
So that was intriguing.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Why would that be?

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Where did they come from?

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:84%
A lot of questions
started popping up.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And simultaneous
to this, we're also

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.010 align:middle line:84%
looking into a lot of
other anomalous things.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.200 align:middle line:84%
We've already covered
a story, Kathy and I

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.720 align:middle line:90%
did, on the Joplin Spook Lights.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.460 align:middle line:90%
Totally bizarre.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:84%
I tried to walk into
the woods to get closer

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.840 align:middle line:84%
to see if it was
really a person.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.220 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a person.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.180 align:middle line:84%
You have the lights in Texas,
the Marfa Lights And over

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.430 align:middle line:84%
in, I think, North
or South Carolina,

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.527 align:middle line:90%
it's the Brown Mountain Lights.

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got others
in other parts of the country

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.390 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.340 align:middle line:90%
None of these are explainable.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So there was another
pin on the map for us

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:90%
to do more inquiry about.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And then we came in contact
with the folks in Arkansas,

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.440 align:middle line:90%
right outside of Mena, Arkansas.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.148 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those are
famous crystal mines.

00:04:06.148 --> 00:04:08.315 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, it's a great
place for crystal mines.

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, there's a
place called Board Camp Mine.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.870 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed those folks
during one of my shows.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And they have video
of a rock levitating,

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:90%
rocks moving by themselves.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And in talking to
them, they're saying

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.950 align:middle line:84%
that there are also
prolific Bigfoot encounters

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and that there are beams
of light shooting up

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.390 align:middle line:84%
out of the ground, a bluish
color beam of light shooting up

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.615 align:middle line:84%
out of the ground into the
sky on several occasions

00:04:38.615 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes several
lights, as I remember.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.800 align:middle line:84%
That was really something
to consider as well.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.870 align:middle line:90%
So we started talking.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Then David Paulides.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Then David Paulides.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You started
encountering that information.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Please explain to everybody
that doesn't know his story.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, David Paulides
has done extraordinary research

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and brought several
books forward

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:84%
about people that go into
the national park system

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.120 align:middle line:90%
never to be seen again.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, that on the
surface could be

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.090 align:middle line:84%
taken as, well,
maybe they got lost

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and they died, or whatever, and
I'm sure there's some of that.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or there are creepy
people there or whatever,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.800 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Something, explainable.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But in way
too many instances,

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.750 align:middle line:84%
for example, this
one fellow, he's

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:84%
just in a group of
100 people running,

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:84%
but he vanishes never
to be seen again.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:84%
A child playing right
there next to his parents--

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.230 align:middle line:90%
they turn away.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:90%
They turn back.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:90%
He's gone.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:84%
They find his body somewhere
up on the mountains.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.730 align:middle line:84%
It had not been
attacked by an animal.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of the crazy
things is a lot of times,

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:84%
they find the person's
shoes taken off,

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:90%
and that's all they find.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.370 align:middle line:84%
In the case of this
particular person,

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.650 align:middle line:84%
they found the clothes
inside out right there next

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.370 align:middle line:90%
to the remains.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.830 align:middle line:84%
The remains weren't found
for like four years,

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and this is right here outside
of Boulder, this child.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And the clothes didn't look
like they had any wear on them

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.980 align:middle line:90%
at all after four winters.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.483 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, this really,
really strange thing.

00:06:18.483 --> 00:06:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The implication being
that the little boy's body

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.472 align:middle line:90%
was deposited back there.

00:06:22.472 --> 00:06:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, somehow
it ended up there.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.340 align:middle line:90%
No one knows how.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.210 align:middle line:84%
There are even instances
where someone, a child,

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.780 align:middle line:84%
is gone from here, and they're
found, like 15, 20 miles away

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.280 align:middle line:90%
on some other mountain side.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.065 align:middle line:84%
And the rescuers find them and
they don't have their shoes on.

00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
how they got there.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.398 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they can't
communicate anyway.

00:06:41.398 --> 00:06:42.740 align:middle line:90%
They're just children.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.510 align:middle line:90%
A lot of strange things.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.260 align:middle line:90%
How is this possible?

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So we're just
wondering about this.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, while we're accumulating
these different data

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.390 align:middle line:84%
points of different
strange events,

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Kathy started watching
something on YouTube

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.640 align:middle line:84%
by this fellow that goes
by the name of Dutchsinse.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.140 align:middle line:90%
And what he's doing--

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.390 align:middle line:84%
nothing really connected
with what we're doing.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just interesting for
us, because he's figured out

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.050 align:middle line:90%
how to predict earthquakes.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
he's good at it.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: He's really good.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And he's showing these
maps and these fault lines.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about the
North America Craton

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.980 align:middle line:90%
And Kathy goes, wait a minute.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.970 align:middle line:84%
See that little dip that
goes up and back down again?

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.650 align:middle line:10%
That's right there
at Mena, Arkansas.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.770 align:middle line:10%
It's just right in the same
vicinity as Joplin Spook

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.420 align:middle line:10%
Lights.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.345 align:middle line:10%
And look, these Marfa Lights,
that's right down here

00:07:38.345 --> 00:07:40.320 align:middle line:10%
at this part of the craton.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.800 align:middle line:90%
Well, gee, that's interesting.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And then we started looking
at the David Paulides map,

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and there was another
pattern there.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So we started looking
at these different maps

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:84%
that folks have generated
that show us what they found.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And these maps start looking
as though there is a pattern,

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.430 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Bigfoot,
UFOs, missing people,

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.780 align:middle line:90%
or the spook lights.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're showing a couple
maps as we're talking here.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And so the thick line that
you're seeing is the craton.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.930 align:middle line:84%
But you need to explain now
to everyone what a craton is.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, that's
good, because I

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.880 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what it was either.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a geologist,
so this is going

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.477 align:middle line:84%
to be like elementary
school explanation.

00:08:23.477 --> 00:08:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's-- we're
all there with you.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.363 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: OK, good.

00:08:26.363 --> 00:08:28.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there are
geologists watching, going,

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.990 align:middle line:90%
oh, I could have said it better.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, the craton,
as I understand it,

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:38.000 align:middle line:84%
is a very large,
solid, dependably

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.343 align:middle line:90%
in place piece of rock.

00:08:41.343 --> 00:08:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how far
down into the Earth

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.670 align:middle line:84%
it goes, but
everything around it

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.340 align:middle line:84%
is going to be subject
to shift and abuse,

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.680 align:middle line:84%
but the craton is going
to be very, very solid.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It would appear that
Kansas and up into the Midwest

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and up into the
Dakotas there and such

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.290 align:middle line:84%
would all be part
of that, right?

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So those would
be more stable land masses.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.130 align:middle line:84%
The only thing
missing from this map

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.723 align:middle line:84%
is showing a fault line that
goes up the Mississippi River.

00:09:09.723 --> 00:09:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to ask about that.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:12.190 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So within it, there
is this fault line.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: There is.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And actually right off
to the right side of it,

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.820 align:middle line:84%
there is a second-- you
see the black line there?

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.090 align:middle line:84%
That is the second
aspect of the craton,

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:84%
but you have mountains right
there in between the two.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.485 align:middle line:84%
And right there on
that black line,

00:09:27.485 --> 00:09:29.540 align:middle line:84%
I think it's in South
Carolina, where you

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.100 align:middle line:90%
have the Brown Mountain Lights.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.560 align:middle line:10%
It follows right along
where that line ends.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.387 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now we
see all these clusters.

00:09:36.387 --> 00:09:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And these represent--
each of the maps

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.770 align:middle line:84%
represents different clusters
of different kinds of sightings

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:41.570 align:middle line:90%
and experiences.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then you see on
the West Coast, that goes down

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.750 align:middle line:84%
the Pacific Ring of Fire
into the San Andreas fault

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:51.110 align:middle line:84%
line, the famous San Andreas,
which, I think Dutch says,

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.252 align:middle line:84%
has some activity
coming up pretty soon.

00:09:53.252 --> 00:09:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah,
actually, I've heard

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.540 align:middle line:90%
from a few different sources.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:84%
we want to go there
and be standing just

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:84%
in the desert there in
Southern California.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.150 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be going
out in the desert,

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and I want to do a live
broadcast during an earthquake.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Dutch
better be precise.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.480 align:middle line:84%
You might be melting out
there for a few days.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I want to wait
until the weather cools off.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.653 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, not to
distract you, but yeah,

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:22.820 align:middle line:84%
so that's what the clusters
down the West Coast are,

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.840 align:middle line:90%
is fault activity.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, it is, and if you
were to take a look at the USGS

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.290 align:middle line:84%
maps-- which I couldn't
find one for the show today.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:36.260 align:middle line:84%
But they are out there, and they
show these spider vein looking

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:41.210 align:middle line:84%
lines all through, from outside
the West Coast and the ocean

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.080 align:middle line:90%
all the way across into Nevada.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Then there are some that
go across the bottom

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.430 align:middle line:84%
there, where you see
where Southern California

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.770 align:middle line:90%
into Arizona and so forth.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:56.360 align:middle line:84%
There are all these spider web
vein of fissures and fractures

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and fracture zones,
because the plates

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.210 align:middle line:90%
are pushing against that.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.835 align:middle line:84%
And because they're
pushing against it,

00:11:01.835 --> 00:11:03.282 align:middle line:90%
it's breaking it up.

00:11:03.282 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And this has been going
on for millions of years.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.840 align:middle line:84%
But how that applies
to the theory

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.240 align:middle line:84%
that Kathy brought
to my attention

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.760 align:middle line:90%
was because I know electronics.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And I know you take a
crystal, you squeeze it,

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and you get
electricity out of it.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.740 align:middle line:84%
But now you've got
something that's thousands

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:90%
of miles long being squeezed.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And when one thing shifts, it's
like an impact on that crystal

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:84%
that releases all
kinds of energy.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And when that
energy is released,

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.510 align:middle line:84%
it's got to go somewhere,
either through the Earth

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:84%
as an electrical charge,
into the air as lightning,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.075 align:middle line:90%
or who knows?

00:11:44.075 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:84%
You get enough of this energy
and very strange things

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.180 align:middle line:90%
can happen on the surface.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And what we are
wanting to do next

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:54.470 align:middle line:84%
with this theory, because we're
speculating at this point,

00:11:54.470 --> 00:12:01.040 align:middle line:84%
is we want to get a
record of specific dates,

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.440 align:middle line:84%
as close as possible,
were there are

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
disappearances, specific
dates, for example,

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.685 align:middle line:90%
from Board Camp Mine.

00:12:08.685 --> 00:12:10.310 align:middle line:84%
In that case, it
should be easy enough,

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.490 align:middle line:84%
because they have cameras
with clocks on them,

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:84%
to get time and date
when something happened.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Start gathering
this data and then

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.480 align:middle line:84%
compare it to when
there have been--

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Phenomena,
activity, yeah.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, the Earth, like
a quake or a tremor or whatever,

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.910 align:middle line:90%
even if it wasn't in that area.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Because what you've got
here is a conductivity

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.000 align:middle line:84%
that goes through the stones,
and it goes all the way

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.430 align:middle line:84%
around and through
these different areas.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So we want to get that data,
plug it in, and then see

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.420 align:middle line:84%
if there is really
something to this theory.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.060 align:middle line:84%
We've not found anyone else
looking at it this way.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And if it happens that we do see
that this pattern is beginning

00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:01.340 align:middle line:84%
to fully form from just an
obvious looking thing on paper

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.170 align:middle line:84%
to actually having some
data to support it,

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.820 align:middle line:84%
then would it be possible
with enough data--

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:84%
and I think we can
get that data--

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.030 align:middle line:84%
would it be possible to build
a device so that you could

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:18.110 align:middle line:84%
measure the energy and perhaps
predict when an event was going

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:22.040 align:middle line:90%
to take place using technology?

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:84%
If so, it might
not explain where

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.170 align:middle line:90%
people go when they go missing.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it wouldn't,
but it could explain why.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, if you
have a massive shift

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.460 align:middle line:84%
in the electromagnetic
field, and we're in an

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.050 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional--

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.260 align:middle line:84%
we're on a planet that
has multi dimensions, just

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.950 align:middle line:84%
as we are multidimensional,
that's the interesting

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:90%
crossover there.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.140 align:middle line:84%
With the electromagnetic
field doing a very rapid

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.860 align:middle line:84%
sudden shift, how can
that affect our own field

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.830 align:middle line:84%
or the field of
these beings to be

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:84%
able to become
more or less dense?

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, here's a couple
of really strange things

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.290 align:middle line:90%
along that line of thought.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:12.470 align:middle line:84%
First off, a jet is
approaching the Miami airport

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly,
it just isn't there.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And for 10 minutes,
they can't find it.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.040 align:middle line:84%
They presume some terrible
thing has happened.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:90%
It's crashed.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.717 align:middle line:84%
And then 10 minutes go by,
and suddenly, the pilot's

00:14:26.717 --> 00:14:28.550 align:middle line:84%
on there going, why
aren't you answering us?

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.730 align:middle line:90%
The jet lands.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:84%
They check the
chronometer on the jet,

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.570 align:middle line:84%
which is always being
checked during flight

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:38.690 align:middle line:90%
and before approach.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And the peoples'
watches, everybody

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.540 align:middle line:90%
was 10 minutes behind.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:90%
That's just one instance.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.272 align:middle line:84%
There's a bunch of these
over the Bermuda Triangle.

00:14:48.272 --> 00:14:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is the
phenomena that people often

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.890 align:middle line:90%
see with UFOs.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:52.850 align:middle line:90%
They blink in and out.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:53.720 align:middle line:90%
They're there.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.220 align:middle line:84%
They're going
across a trajectory,

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.380 align:middle line:84%
they just disappear, and
boom, you see them again.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And so this blinking in
and out is just a matter

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.460 align:middle line:90%
of shifting densities.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, either
that or finding a wormhole

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.990 align:middle line:90%
and passing through it.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or finding
a wormhole, right.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.105 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Now,
there's an instance

00:15:09.105 --> 00:15:12.350 align:middle line:84%
where a fellow was driving in
New Jersey, ended up suddenly

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.330 align:middle line:84%
finding himself
on the West Coast.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.730 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't explain
how he got there.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.180 align:middle line:84%
There's another fellow
that was skiing.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, he disappeared,
and he's someplace else.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't explain
how he got there.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:24.700 align:middle line:90%
And then there's me.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.220 align:middle line:84%
I was driving for
a carton of smokes

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.310 align:middle line:90%
in the East Phoenix Valley.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:31.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm going along.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Been on this route a few times
going to the reservation.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.910 align:middle line:90%
They're less expensive there.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I just blink,

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going down a dirt
road at 65 miles an hour,

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:46.420 align:middle line:84%
coming to the end of
the road where it Ts.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Unsafe.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.696 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And I scream to
a stop on this dirt road.

00:15:51.696 --> 00:15:53.110 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking around.

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I can't figure out
how I got there.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.460 align:middle line:84%
I was just driving
down the road.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I was a couple miles
away from my destination.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.520 align:middle line:90%
So I call Kathy and I--

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm all shook up.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.410 align:middle line:84%
I say, I don't know
exactly how this happened,

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know where I'm at.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.200 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.020 align:middle line:90%
I explained it.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.680 align:middle line:84%
She says, oh, gosh, well,
tell me your surroundings.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.950 align:middle line:84%
She got Google Earth, and
finally we figured out,

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I was about seven miles
away from where I had been.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:26.370 align:middle line:90%
Made my way back.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:27.870 align:middle line:90%
Got over there.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Did my business and
left and went back home.

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I have never been able to
explain how that happened.

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I think these events
are taking place

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:84%
in a random pattern at random
times, and seemingly so,

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:84%
but I also believe
that there is some way

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:50.350 align:middle line:84%
to detect before it occurs,
and because of that,

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to find as
much data as possible

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.515 align:middle line:84%
in order to see if there
is any correlation.

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It would
be interesting

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.468 align:middle line:90%
if it can become predictive.

00:16:59.468 --> 00:17:01.760 align:middle line:84%
But then you look at some
other cases of disappearance,

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:84%
the famous Bermuda Triangle,
right, with small aircraft

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.013 align:middle line:90%
and so forth disappearing.

00:17:07.013 --> 00:17:08.180 align:middle line:90%
And then you think about it.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, under there, theoretically,
was the last island

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.240 align:middle line:90%
or continent of Atlantis.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:18.700 align:middle line:84%
We know it went down in a fury,
in terms of earthquake activity

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.960 align:middle line:90%
and other activity as well.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, a very active
mass underneath the ocean floor

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.540 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.569 align:middle line:84%
So that could be subject
to this phenomenon

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:30.070 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about as well.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, I think so.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't happening just
on the surface of the Earth.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:40.730 align:middle line:84%
It's happening above the
surface of the Earth as well.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of the storms
that we see have something

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.010 align:middle line:90%
to do with this.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I mention that
is because Professor David

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Paris, who is a fellow
who lives in Omaha,

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.380 align:middle line:84%
he has built a real
working warp drive.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:00.760 align:middle line:84%
We interviewed him, and he
is basically a meteorologist

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.640 align:middle line:90%
and an engineer.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Teaches at the University
of Nebraska Omaha.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And he was telling me about
a lot of strange weather

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:08.680 align:middle line:84%
phenomena and
trying to figure out

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.800 align:middle line:84%
exactly how there was a
correlation between the weather

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.307 align:middle line:84%
phenomena and electromagnetic
energy happening

00:18:15.307 --> 00:18:17.890 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth at that time, or
if there was something happening

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:20.140 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere
that was the impetus

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.690 align:middle line:84%
for this strange
phenomena to occur.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:26.830 align:middle line:84%
He had several instances
of private aircraft

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.270 align:middle line:84%
that were flying along
and suddenly, they're

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:32.310 align:middle line:90%
100 miles further down route.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.450 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
how they got there.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's provable
they didn't fly there

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.160 align:middle line:84%
because the amount of fuel they
had leaving from the Bahamas

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.840 align:middle line:90%
and going towards Miami.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.310 align:middle line:90%
A lot of instances of this.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.435 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's interesting.

00:18:43.435 --> 00:18:46.070 align:middle line:84%
You almost-- it could almost
be like a time slippage too.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yes, exactly.

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where our
interface with timelines

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.810 align:middle line:90%
is becoming less stable.

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm just kind of
looking at what you're saying

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:84%
and then I want to add another
little phenomena on that.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe 8 to 10 years
ago or so, there

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.560 align:middle line:84%
was some really weird
weather activity

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.390 align:middle line:90%
happening in the Midwest.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.572 align:middle line:90%
And I was looking into it.

00:19:08.572 --> 00:19:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, you
know, I think I'm going to go

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.200 align:middle line:84%
into a deeper meditation, one
of those where either you get

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.730 align:middle line:90%
something or you don't.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:19.330 align:middle line:84%
The way I do it is show me if
I'm supposed to see something.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.080 align:middle line:84%
If not, just keep
the screen black,

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.050 align:middle line:90%
and I'll go on with my day.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't have
a lot of attachment.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But what happened in this
particular session was

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.020 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing these
vortices, right.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.723 align:middle line:84%
And you know how everyone's
talked about for years--

00:19:34.723 --> 00:19:36.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think Gregg
Braden really brought it

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:84%
to our attention--
the pole reversal,

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.190 align:middle line:84%
the flip in the magnetic
field and that this

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.840 align:middle line:90%
happens every so often.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And so what I was
being shown was

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:49.810 align:middle line:84%
that there were spots
dotted all around the Earth

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:54.190 align:middle line:84%
where the local polarity had
already reversed itself, right?

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And that this wasn't
like an overnight thing.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.770 align:middle line:84%
That it's something
that starts happening.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and gaining in its
strength and power

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.650 align:middle line:84%
just through the
sheer numbers of spots

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.040 align:middle line:90%
that start reversing it.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.540 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well,
that's interesting.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.180 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a more gentle
way to ease into it.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But could the reversal of
polarity in given regions also

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:15.630 align:middle line:90%
have something to do with it?

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.625 align:middle line:84%
And we're just speculating,
because this is all a matter

00:20:17.625 --> 00:20:19.010 align:middle line:90%
of speculation at this point.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh, yeah, it is.

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, to
any viewers watching,

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.100 align:middle line:84%
if they have their own kind
of ideas and experiences

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.930 align:middle line:84%
with this, we'd love
to hear from you.

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, we've
gotten our supporters

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.610 align:middle line:84%
on Patreon involved to start
helping us crunch the numbers

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:35.750 align:middle line:90%
and gather the data.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's wonderful.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about all these
different potential tears

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.260 align:middle line:90%
in what we think of as reality.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, you know one of
the things that came to my mind

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.690 align:middle line:84%
when we started doing this
research was having lived near

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:49.490 align:middle line:90%
Sedona--

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:50.730 align:middle line:90%
you lived in Sedona.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, for many years.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It's a well-known
area for vortices,

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and they're very
detectable, so what

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:05.160 align:middle line:84%
happens when you have
a vortex like that,

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and one of these
Earth energy events

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.600 align:middle line:84%
adds incredible
amounts of power to it?

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Is this going to be responding,
as you might consider,

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.780 align:middle line:84%
that it just increases
the strength of the field?

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Or would it become
so strong that it

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:90%
could reverse that field?

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Could it be so strong
that it actually opens up

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.810 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is that opens up,
and there's another universe

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.100 align:middle line:90%
right there parallel to it?

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly and that's--

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we get into
a bit of a hermetic view

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:84%
of the whole thing,
where the Earth

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:46.250 align:middle line:84%
is positioned in this
particular spot between higher

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.950 align:middle line:90%
and lower realms.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking, three
above, three below.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And again, I've met
people, and we're

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.420 align:middle line:84%
talking about some
creatures here,

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.595 align:middle line:90%
as well, that come through.

00:21:57.595 --> 00:21:58.970 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
about skin walkers.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.220 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a lot
of different odd phenomena--

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.090 align:middle line:90%
chupacabra--

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.340 align:middle line:90%
things that don't belong here.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.060 align:middle line:84%
They're not part of
our physical reality.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Yet, they can show up,
and people see them.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.280 align:middle line:90%
So what about this notion?

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.220 align:middle line:84%
That where you're
in an area with kind

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.100 align:middle line:84%
of extreme potential
for energetic disruption

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:20.420 align:middle line:84%
or disturbance, you're creating
rifts or terrors, so to speak,

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:24.470 align:middle line:84%
that allow for a bleed through
from another dimension.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a negative event,
literally another realm,

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:31.460 align:middle line:84%
another dimensional
realm of reality

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.370 align:middle line:84%
to bleed through
into this one, where

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:37.880 align:middle line:84%
events are more challenging,
where the beings

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.380 align:middle line:90%
are more frightening.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they steal
energy and so forth.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:45.950 align:middle line:84%
That's their domain
possibly spilling over.

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Is that any different than when
people have a bleed through,

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.830 align:middle line:84%
where they leave their body, and
they're suddenly in that higher

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:55.820 align:middle line:84%
realm, where they're seeing
light and beautiful entities

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and being shown the
beautiful ways forward?

00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Good point.

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:03.170 align:middle line:90%
You know, I see--

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how
to use the term in less

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:10.760 align:middle line:84%
of or in a more descriptive way,
but let's call it dimensions.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as
layers on an onion

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:17.270 align:middle line:84%
or just layers of different
kinds of ice creams--

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.790 align:middle line:90%
chocolate, strawberry, vanilla.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And you've got something
over here on this layer,

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:27.950 align:middle line:84%
we'll call it layer
one and layer two

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:29.690 align:middle line:90%
and three and four and five.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:31.418 align:middle line:84%
They all have their
own things going on.

00:23:31.418 --> 00:23:33.710 align:middle line:84%
It looks like the Earth, but
there are different things

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:34.880 align:middle line:90%
happening there.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.398 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost as though you
were tuning a radio across.

00:23:37.398 --> 00:23:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, just
the different dimensions,

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:43.140 align:middle line:84%
each one having its own
reality, its own civilizations.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So these huge
potentials of energy

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.740 align:middle line:84%
that are causing
a rift, they would

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.980 align:middle line:84%
be moving across
like a wave of energy

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.080 align:middle line:84%
through these
different dimensions.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.075 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we want to try to
figure out how to measure this.

00:23:57.075 --> 00:23:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I think
it's fascinating,

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:05.000 align:middle line:84%
because nobody really puts
the notion of tectonic plates

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.510 align:middle line:84%
and Earth activity,
seismic activity,

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.690 align:middle line:84%
in the same conversation
with Bigfoot

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and all of these other
phenomena we're talking about.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Sure, because Bigfoot
just walk along and vanish.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.530 align:middle line:84%
These cryptoid
things, whatever they

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:84%
are, whether the chupacabra
or the insect looking things,

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:90%
they're there.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.440 align:middle line:90%
They're gone.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.240 align:middle line:90%
You know the same--

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about skin walkers.

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm not so sure about that.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.940 align:middle line:84%
I think that's something
entirely different.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:10%
But you have a potential
of energy that is in place,

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.910 align:middle line:10%
and you have someone
that walks into it

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:45.152 align:middle line:10%
that destabilizes, takes
out of harmony, that energy.

00:24:45.152 --> 00:24:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or could
it be the energy

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:50.120 align:middle line:84%
is destabilizing
them, either way.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: You know
I look at it more

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:53.453 align:middle line:90%
like an electronic circuit.

00:24:53.453 --> 00:24:55.870 align:middle line:84%
If you have a tuned circuit,
you stick something in there,

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:57.410 align:middle line:90%
it becomes untuned.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:84%
The energy has to
go somewhere, and it

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.540 align:middle line:84%
goes into the person in
this particular case.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.760 align:middle line:84%
If you had a coil and run
electricity through it,

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.460 align:middle line:84%
low frequency, you
know? it isn't DC.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.260 align:middle line:90%
It's AC.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like 15,000
cycles, just a coil.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And you put a nail in
there, that's going

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.880 align:middle line:90%
to change how that coil works.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.680 align:middle line:90%
That coil's creating a field.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.160 align:middle line:84%
The nail represents something
foreign going into the field,

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and it disturbs the
balance of that coil.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
used to tune circuits--

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:90%
used to, back in tube days.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, they still do it with
antennas for ham radios.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you have this field
of energy that suddenly just

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.900 align:middle line:84%
blooms up, and, of course,
you can't tell it's there.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.370 align:middle line:84%
It's invisible, but
you walk into it,

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.740 align:middle line:84%
and now you're sucking
that energy into you,

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.650 align:middle line:84%
because that energy's going
to go into the person, which

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:52.730 align:middle line:84%
is going to mean that more
energy is going to be pulled up

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.080 align:middle line:90%
from where this came from.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.520 align:middle line:84%
It's going to try to bring
the person into balance

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.780 align:middle line:90%
with the field.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:58.670 align:middle line:90%
That's the objective.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.513 align:middle line:84%
If there's enough
energy, it will do that.

00:26:00.513 --> 00:26:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're going
to resonate yourself

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:03.498 align:middle line:90%
in with that field.

00:26:03.498 --> 00:26:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And then
the field is moving

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.310 align:middle line:84%
across these
different dimensions,

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.560 align:middle line:84%
these different
versions of reality,

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.590 align:middle line:90%
these different bandwidths.

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as the
energy normalizes,

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.930 align:middle line:90%
where are you deposited?

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:20.070 align:middle line:90%
You don't know.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:84%
No one does,
including the person

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.950 align:middle line:84%
left in the case of the
young Indian boy that

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:29.010 align:middle line:84%
jumped through the doorway
at the Crystal Plateau

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:90%
in Southern Arizona.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:36.390 align:middle line:84%
He was never seen again, but
about 80 years later, a body

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:40.350 align:middle line:84%
was found of a young boy,
not too far from the doorway.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And no one could identify who
he was or where he'd come from.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the
same young man that

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.940 align:middle line:90%
jumped through that doorway.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.410 align:middle line:90%
He probably died of exposure.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:52.570 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it shocked him to death.

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:54.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.480 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that
in electronics,

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.100 align:middle line:84%
if you bring something
in like that,

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.840 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be
a shift in the field,

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.290 align:middle line:84%
if there's enough energy
potential to come up and try

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.300 align:middle line:90%
to stabilize the field.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.610 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't burn
up whatever is there,

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think
this would, it's

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:13.420 align:middle line:84%
going to put you in
resonance with the field,

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to shift
you someplace else.

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's
another phenomena

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:22.320 align:middle line:84%
that we can start putting in
place here, because it somehow

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.180 align:middle line:90%
all goes together, right?

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:29.310 align:middle line:84%
We're in a very unstable kind
of reality right now, it seems.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:34.260 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the notion that
the Earth herself is bumping up

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.152 align:middle line:84%
in frequency range,
you know some people

00:27:36.152 --> 00:27:37.110 align:middle line:90%
say we're in the third.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Boom, now, we're in the
fifth, sixth, and so forth.

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:41.055 align:middle line:84%
I think it happens a little
differently and more gradually

00:27:41.055 --> 00:27:41.855 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:27:41.855 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, it seems
that we have made headway

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.390 align:middle line:84%
in moving into, at least, a
fourth dimensional field now,

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:49.560 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:54.133 align:middle line:84%
How does that then start
interfacing with all this?

00:27:54.133 --> 00:27:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to bring up one thing

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.810 align:middle line:84%
and then get your
point of view on it.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:01.440 align:middle line:84%
I've had the feeling,
as I've thought

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.300 align:middle line:84%
about it through
the years, that some

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:07.440 align:middle line:84%
of the disappearing
species are staying

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.310 align:middle line:84%
in the previous
frequency range of Earth.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.290 align:middle line:84%
They're staying on in
third-dimensional form

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:17.430 align:middle line:84%
with a third-dimensional
aspect of Earth.

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And if we're moving
into and are already

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:84%
into the fourth
dimension, maybe it's

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.850 align:middle line:84%
just that some of those
species aren't visible to us

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:27.330 align:middle line:84%
any longer but still exist
within their own frequency

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:31.920 align:middle line:84%
band, which means we should
start seeing new species coming

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.000 align:middle line:84%
in on this frequency
range as well, right?

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.088 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I suppose, and maybe
that's what we are seeing.

00:28:39.088 --> 00:28:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what--
I'm just laying stuff out

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:42.630 align:middle line:84%
there that I've
been thinking about,

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:44.110 align:middle line:90%
because you're a fun playmate.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:46.530 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:51.030 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLS: I understand,
and that is something

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.660 align:middle line:10%
that I have considered as well
because of the Mandela Effect.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, what is
going on with that?

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And you've got things
that are so different.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And moving into a different
realm of existence,

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.360 align:middle line:84%
I was talking before about
different bandwidths,

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.810 align:middle line:84%
like this, one, two, three,
four, five, and so on.

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:11.228 align:middle line:84%
Well, what you're
saying basically

00:29:11.228 --> 00:29:12.770 align:middle line:84%
is we're going into
fourth dimension.

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:13.590 align:middle line:90%
It's another bandwidth.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:14.882 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bandwidth, that's it.

00:29:14.882 --> 00:29:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And we're
leaving things behind.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm inclined
to agree with that.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how it works

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it seems that
it's all frequency based.

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.340 align:middle line:84%
We can only perceive in
a certain band, right?

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Exactly.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this
exists in a band we have

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:31.890 align:middle line:90%
our perceptive capabilities in.

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:35.730 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean the other third
dimension of previous times

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:37.920 align:middle line:84%
doesn't exist, and
it doesn't mean

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.150 align:middle line:90%
the higher realms don't exist.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:41.720 align:middle line:90%
We're just not dialed into them.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And then what
might be happening?

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is going into one
of these portals or vortexes,

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and they're ending up 100 years
in the future or 1,000 years

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:53.880 align:middle line:90%
in the past?

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so in a sense,
we know time is not linear.

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's exactly right.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.410 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things
that we've looked at--

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:04.800 align:middle line:10%
for example, there is a report
out of Tombstone, Arizona

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.420 align:middle line:10%
in the late 1800s, where these
ranchers were really upset

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.620 align:middle line:10%
because a large, leathery bird
was jumping down out of the sky

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.210 align:middle line:10%
and taking calves.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:16.260 align:middle line:90%
They shot it.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.060 align:middle line:90%
Took pictures.

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.720 align:middle line:90%
It ends up being a pterodactyl.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Tombstone, versus
where this plateau is,

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.760 align:middle line:90%
is not that far apart.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Did this thing,
this pterodactyl,

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:30.220 align:middle line:84%
get somehow caught in
one of these vortices

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:34.280 align:middle line:84%
and get just suddenly bumped a
million years into the future?

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And if so, like you were saying,
some of these things that

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.150 align:middle line:84%
have just gone missing
and in some instances

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:44.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that folks don't even
realize that they ever existed.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.170 align:middle line:84%
But they're gone and
the reason I mention

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:49.150 align:middle line:84%
that is because
there's a whole lot

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.360 align:middle line:84%
of folks that don't realize
the little subtle changes that

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.320 align:middle line:84%
have taken place where the
Mandela Effect is in existence.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that as well.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It's like, we're
surrounded by people that we

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:05.650 align:middle line:84%
merged with, and they're going,
no, it's always been that way.

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking
at it, going, what?

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I mean, I'm just
trying to paint this picture.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:16.130 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like total chaos,
because it is, in a sense.

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.760 align:middle line:84%
But if we think back, and
I've had this validated

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:23.230 align:middle line:84%
through my own group of
beings that I'm a part of

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and deal with,
it's my soul group,

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.430 align:middle line:84%
also with Sheila Gillette
and the Theo Group.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And they all said,
yes, dragons walked

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.610 align:middle line:84%
the Earth, when it was in a
particular frequency range.

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And they still exist, and
they can show themselves

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.055 align:middle line:84%
to various people
but in an off band

00:31:39.055 --> 00:31:42.340 align:middle line:84%
that most people can't see
into any longer, right?

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we know species that
are well-known in our lore

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:49.240 align:middle line:84%
have existed before
and have come and gone.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So how many other hundreds
or thousands of other species

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:56.300 align:middle line:84%
are doing the same thing
that we're not even aware?

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.100 align:middle line:90%
So look at this--

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, here we go.

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:01.430 align:middle line:84%
We have a dimensional shift
going on, on the planet.

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:06.490 align:middle line:84%
We have an impending pole shift,
and I'm seeing little pockets

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.720 align:middle line:90%
already in advance on that one.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Me, too.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're seeing this
Earth activity going on, right,

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.730 align:middle line:90%
these major fault line areas.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:19.600 align:middle line:84%
What is that a recipe for except
one anomaly after another?

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Oh, and it
gets even better.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK,
entertain us some more.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh, this is--

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:27.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure some folks
know about this.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:34.210 align:middle line:84%
But about 1945, our position
around the edge of the Milky

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Way galaxy, we're always
progressing forward.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:40.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very long, tens
of thousands of years cycle.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, procession of the
equinox, you're referring to,

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:42.070 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Exactly.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:48.340 align:middle line:84%
In the '40s, we started coming
out from behind the greater

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Magellanic cloud.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.510 align:middle line:84%
That isolates us from
the center of the galaxy.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:55.930 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that we're
just in direct line of sight.

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:59.320 align:middle line:84%
If we were, the night would
be brighter than the day,

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.750 align:middle line:90%
there's so much light there.

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:04.660 align:middle line:90%
But we move around.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:07.540 align:middle line:84%
We're coming to a thinner and
thinner and thinner region.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.460 align:middle line:84%
What that means
is, is the energy

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.190 align:middle line:84%
coming from the black hole at
the center of the Milky Way

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:16.670 align:middle line:84%
galaxy, it's spewing energy
outward in all directions.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And that energy
has a direct impact

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.840 align:middle line:84%
on our sun because of the
type of particulate matter

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.910 align:middle line:90%
that's hitting the sun.

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
the sun is going

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.990 align:middle line:90%
to go through some changes.

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And when that field
around the sun changes--

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:36.130 align:middle line:84%
remember I talked about
the nail and the coil?

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, you start changing
the resonant value of what's

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.030 align:middle line:90%
called the solar capacitor.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Fans of the electric
universe will

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.040 align:middle line:84%
know what I'm talking about,
but it causes an intense change

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.350 align:middle line:90%
in the energy.

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:53.140 align:middle line:84%
That change is energy
that is being changed.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And energy can't be
created or destroyed.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.790 align:middle line:84%
It has to be changed,
and when it gets changed,

00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:01.150 align:middle line:84%
it changes into something
else, in this case, heat.

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:03.460 align:middle line:84%
When this heat
occurs, it's going

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:06.670 align:middle line:84%
to cause not just the Earth
but the other planets out there

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:08.530 align:middle line:84%
to also reciprocate
with a change,

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:10.840 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly
what's being seen.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
not in a position

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.690 align:middle line:90%
to control anything right now.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:17.080 align:middle line:84%
That's, I think,
the grace in this

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.139 align:middle line:84%
is to realize we've all chosen
to incarnate at this time

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:24.320 align:middle line:84%
to be part of this crazy
transition or transformation.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.969 align:middle line:84%
And so we shouldn't be surprised
at some of the forms it takes

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:30.639 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
anomalies, events that

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:32.080 align:middle line:90%
may happen in our own lives.

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, we have
a group of people

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:37.239 align:middle line:84%
who have been interacting
quite normally and naturally

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:41.050 align:middle line:84%
with anomalies for a long
time in Navajo country.

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And you know the Navajo
Rangers, Stanley and John.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And you've interviewed
them on your site, yeah?

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah,
Fantastic interview.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god, it was gripping.

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:51.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about-- we were
going to try to Skype them in.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:54.920 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I know.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there
are political problems,

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.820 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of the
elders and tribal members

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:04.212 align:middle line:84%
really don't want a lot of their
information being passed around

00:35:04.212 --> 00:35:05.170 align:middle line:90%
in the media like this.

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well,
that's part of it.

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:08.770 align:middle line:84%
They're very
close-mouthed about it.

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:11.860 align:middle line:84%
But I think in the
case of one of them,

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:16.790 align:middle line:84%
it had to do with the higher ups
were not very pleased that he

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:21.130 align:middle line:84%
was talking publicly in the
capacity of a police officer.

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:23.247 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
OK, so, no, right.

00:35:23.247 --> 00:35:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: That was
how I understood it.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:26.288 align:middle line:84%
It could be more
than that or less.

00:35:26.288 --> 00:35:27.088 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:35:27.088 --> 00:35:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's see--
if Stanley had come today,

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.965 align:middle line:84%
some of the things
he shared with you.

00:35:30.965 --> 00:35:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh, my gosh.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
what their experience

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.250 align:middle line:84%
is of these various
anomalies on their land,

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:39.250 align:middle line:84%
because they're much
more open to interactions

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:43.310 align:middle line:84%
with other realms than
we are, Westerners are.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, they have a very
rich history that we would call

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.890 align:middle line:84%
some of it mythology and
some of it spiritualism,

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:53.090 align:middle line:90%
but for them, it's life.

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:56.650 align:middle line:84%
For example, I mean
Bigfoot is an example.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Not just from having
spoke with Stan and John,

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:01.630 align:middle line:84%
but it gave us the
impetus to look deeper.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And there are ongoing
Bigfoot reports.

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, most people say
Bigfoot is a big thing

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.810 align:middle line:90%
with black and shaggy hair.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:12.480 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out, in this part
of the country, in the desert,

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.860 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of a reddish-blond
hair, a reddish brown perhaps.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not just all black.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:20.470 align:middle line:84%
The one story that
really stood out to me

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:26.020 align:middle line:84%
was when I was told that they
were called to this one woman's

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.920 align:middle line:84%
home out on the reservation
who had some goats.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And the Bigfoot had stepped
over the fence, grabbed a goat,

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.090 align:middle line:90%
walked off.

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:36.880 align:middle line:84%
They followed it, after
the fact, of course.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.275 align:middle line:90%
They followed the footprints.

00:36:38.275 --> 00:36:41.680 align:middle line:84%
It went up a hill,
taking gigantic strides.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Went down the hill, went out
across this desert plain,

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and the footprints were
easily identifiable.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.040 align:middle line:90%
They were good trackers.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like he took one
more step and just evaporated.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:59.800 align:middle line:84%
No more footprints anywhere,
and it was all on soft ground.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.300 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't really come to
terms with what happened to it.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:02.920 align:middle line:90%
It just vanished.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It disappeared again.

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:05.665 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: This wasn't
the first time something

00:37:05.665 --> 00:37:07.510 align:middle line:84%
like this had
occurred, nor was it

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:10.802 align:middle line:84%
the first time I'd ever heard of
something like this occurring.

00:37:10.802 --> 00:37:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I've
interviewed a fellow named

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.300 align:middle line:90%
SunBow, who's French Canadian.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:19.000 align:middle line:84%
SunBow says if you're looking
at him on a DNA level,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.690 align:middle line:84%
he has some Sasquatch
in him from a ways back.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And that might be why, a
very gentle soul like you,

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.590 align:middle line:84%
why he's able to communicate
freely and telepathically

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:30.430 align:middle line:90%
with Sasquatch.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And he's also seen
them physically

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:35.410 align:middle line:84%
and gathered some hair
samples and things like that.

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And one thing-- he
wrote two books.

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:39.640 align:middle line:90%
And in the books, they talked--

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.940 align:middle line:84%
they told him telepathically
about their own history

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and background as even
preceding humanity

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:49.010 align:middle line:84%
and that they are still
interdimensional as well.

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:51.670 align:middle line:84%
They have the ability to
move between dimensions,

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:53.670 align:middle line:84%
which would explain what
you're talking about.

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:58.390 align:middle line:84%
I think they have some
sort of built in capacity,

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:00.050 align:middle line:90%
like some people are psychic.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And we've met those
folks like that.

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:04.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they just have
an uncanny ability,

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.595 align:middle line:90%
and so why wouldn't it be such?

00:38:05.595 --> 00:38:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
he says it's just

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:09.130 align:middle line:84%
a skill set to be able
to shift your frequency

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:84%
band so you can appear in
one or another dimension

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And just jump into
another place and you're gone.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:18.112 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, so let's
talk about other phenomena.

00:38:18.112 --> 00:38:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Was it Stanley,
you were telling me

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:22.540 align:middle line:84%
on the phone, the coins
falling out of the sky.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:23.890 align:middle line:90%
Where was that coming from?

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:25.932 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, that was
coming from some building

00:38:25.932 --> 00:38:28.940 align:middle line:84%
in the Window Rock area,
some official building.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.650 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to really
give a location on this.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:36.010 align:middle line:84%
But no, I mean, it was the
strangest story you ever heard,

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.265 align:middle line:84%
that coins were just
falling and sometimes they

00:38:38.265 --> 00:38:39.730 align:middle line:90%
were being thrown at them.

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:41.560 align:middle line:84%
They were there
investigating why

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:45.220 align:middle line:84%
are there these anomalous things
going on in this building?

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.185 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
they're having

00:38:47.185 --> 00:38:50.210 align:middle line:90%
these old coins thrown at them.

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And then it followed
them home and started

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:54.910 align:middle line:84%
throwing-- throwing coins
and coins appearing,

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.340 align:middle line:84%
just falling out of
thin air to the floor.

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pennies from heaven.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, it was
just the strangest story.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK, and
because you told me,

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.472 align:middle line:84%
but we were just talking
about it casually.

00:39:07.472 --> 00:39:08.680 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was interesting.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh, it's just bizarre.

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:12.613 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But also, you say that
ghosts and hauntings and that

00:39:12.613 --> 00:39:17.290 align:middle line:84%
sort of thing really are also
prominent around these active--

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: That's something
else we were looking at.

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
it's absolutely

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:22.690 align:middle line:84%
the case, because
we don't really

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:25.960 align:middle line:90%
have an accurate map of this.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:30.130 align:middle line:84%
You see, what we want to do is
find something that continues

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:33.500 align:middle line:84%
to reoccur, like the Joplin
Spook Lights or a haunting

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:37.320 align:middle line:84%
in a building,
this sort of thing.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And when you have something
that occurs on a regular basis,

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:42.670 align:middle line:84%
you can then go back and start
plugging in different data sets

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.060 align:middle line:90%
to how it responds.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, from what
we've seen so far,

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:50.050 align:middle line:84%
there's some very
haunted places,

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:52.630 align:middle line:84%
and they just happen
to be right there

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:58.390 align:middle line:84%
in the same areas as these
fault lines and fissures.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Very, very unusual, and, of
course, it's not so unusual

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.410 align:middle line:90%
when you consider that--

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:07.630 align:middle line:84%
because I pick this up watching
several different shows

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and doing our own research,
the magnetic capacity

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.750 align:middle line:84%
or the electrical capacity,
rather, of the human body,

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.240 align:middle line:90%
it acts like an antenna.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.358 align:middle line:84%
And if you get certain
frequencies of energy

00:40:18.358 --> 00:40:20.400 align:middle line:84%
hitting you, it's going
to make you uncomfortable

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.440 align:middle line:90%
and feel spooked.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe that's the
reason why these places are

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:30.210 align:middle line:84%
so haunted, because
it just really causes

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:31.470 align:middle line:90%
that inside of a person.

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and also, what
I learned with interviewing

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.300 align:middle line:90%
Andrea Perron--

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.970 align:middle line:84%
"The Conjuring's" based
on her family's story.

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Really creepy stuff, right?

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It is.

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One thing that just
fascinated me about her story

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:49.360 align:middle line:84%
is that they manifest
through electricity,

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and they draw on
electrical current.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.800 align:middle line:84%
So again, we're talking about
electrical magnetic activity

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.330 align:middle line:84%
that's happening
in these fissures

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:59.110 align:middle line:90%
and during the seismic activity.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And these entities
were able, in her case,

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.670 align:middle line:84%
to utilize the
energy in the house.

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And she said you could just
watch the meter spinning

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.420 align:middle line:90%
when they were manifesting.

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:12.250 align:middle line:84%
They were sucking up so
much electrical juice.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:15.540 align:middle line:84%
so what is there when we
have seismic activity,

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.210 align:middle line:84%
in terms of entities
being able to manifest

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:19.960 align:middle line:90%
into this dimension?

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, exactly
right, and it seems to me

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.370 align:middle line:84%
that that is a real good
way of explaining it.

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:26.935 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:41:26.935 --> 00:41:28.560 align:middle line:84%
When you were talking
about the meters,

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.880 align:middle line:84%
you reminded me of something
that I was wondering about.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.520 align:middle line:84%
You remember, I told you
about the lights coming out

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.610 align:middle line:84%
of the ground at Board
Camp mine with blue?

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, blue is the
color of plasma.

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:41.895 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
saying near Mena.

00:41:41.895 --> 00:41:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: In Mena, Arkansas.

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:44.103 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Arkansas, right.

00:41:44.103 --> 00:41:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Board Camp Mine.

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Blue is the color of
high energy plasma.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:52.090 align:middle line:84%
If it gets in high
enough concentration,

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:54.660 align:middle line:90%
it can burn things.

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:56.670 align:middle line:84%
You remember in
Paradise, when it

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:59.250 align:middle line:84%
was catching fire and
the reports coming out,

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.090 align:middle line:84%
people were saying
that they thought

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:04.500 align:middle line:84%
it was being beamed in from
space because these lines,

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:08.522 align:middle line:84%
blue lines were just, it seemed
like coming out of the sky.

00:42:08.522 --> 00:42:13.710 align:middle line:84%
What if they were coming out the
Earth, just right there, right

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:19.770 align:middle line:84%
there on top of a whole series
of fracture zones and faults?

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:24.540 align:middle line:84%
I haven't put it together yet,
but it certainly sounds to me

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:28.380 align:middle line:84%
that that kind of energy,
the first place it would go

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:29.400 align:middle line:90%
is into power lines.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And from power lines, it would
go right into the meters.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now, let's add
a little overlay to that,

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:37.180 align:middle line:84%
because I was looking at it
also from another point of view.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:39.390 align:middle line:84%
We've had chem
trails and contrails,

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:42.150 align:middle line:84%
which also have all that
aluminum and junk in it.

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:46.770 align:middle line:84%
We've had this stuff dumped,
that's all across the world

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:49.330 align:middle line:90%
and for, now, decades.

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And so we should be having a
build up of aluminum, for sure,

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:58.530 align:middle line:84%
in the soil, in the debris
on the ground, and so forth.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, they use
that in fireworks.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's an
element in fireworks.

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And everyone kept
saying "up there."

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:07.680 align:middle line:84%
With whatever ignited
it, which could

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:10.740 align:middle line:84%
be what you're talking about,
some trigger from the Earth,

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:15.570 align:middle line:84%
and you have this build
up of these toxic metals

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:19.200 align:middle line:84%
on the ground everywhere,
even in the pine needles.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:23.010 align:middle line:84%
There was almost spontaneous
explosion happening there.

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:24.850 align:middle line:90%
Everything was just exploding.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:26.670 align:middle line:90%
And of course, PG&E--

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:28.920 align:middle line:84%
they literally went
bankrupt as a result

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.013 align:middle line:90%
of that particular event.

00:43:31.013 --> 00:43:33.180 align:middle line:84%
But I always thought like
they were also being a bit

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.730 align:middle line:84%
scapegoated-- and I'm
not a fan of PG&E--

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:38.520 align:middle line:84%
because I think there was
far more going on than that.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I think there was, too.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
you bring up

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:44.190 align:middle line:84%
the chem trails
and the composition

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:46.260 align:middle line:90%
of materials in them.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Because when you take
that and you put it

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:53.640 align:middle line:84%
with this amazing amount
of energy being released

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.340 align:middle line:84%
from the Earth
periodically, you're

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:59.520 align:middle line:84%
basically, in electronics,
you're building a capacitor.

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Something that
stores electricity and then

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:04.440 align:middle line:90%
re-releases it.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.830 align:middle line:84%
You've basically get your
cathode and your anode plate,

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:10.920 align:middle line:84%
and basically, it's a
negative and positive plate.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.130 align:middle line:84%
The area between the two
is your capacitance level.

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And you have enough up here
to create a capacitance level

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:19.283 align:middle line:90%
below the ionosphere.

00:44:19.283 --> 00:44:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Because the
ionosphere is actually

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.040 align:middle line:84%
the top of the
capacitance level.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.880 align:middle line:84%
You bring in a lower, you
just detuned the frequency.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And you've just created
a very potent capacitor,

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:32.550 align:middle line:90%
where energy can be stored.

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:35.130 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
released somehow.

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And could it be
that this is part

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.920 align:middle line:84%
of what HAARP is, to direct
where that energy goes off to?

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, it's said.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.960 align:middle line:84%
It is said that it works
in conjunction with that.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.680 align:middle line:84%
But again, just looking at
all the different factors

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:54.540 align:middle line:84%
that this Earth is being exposed
to and that the Earth herself

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:58.530 align:middle line:84%
is choosing to transition
through on a vibrational level

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:00.990 align:middle line:84%
as well and in terms
of the magnetic field.

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:03.570 align:middle line:84%
That would be Earth's
decision, right?

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And then you're talking
about the solar effects

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.020 align:middle line:90%
that are happening.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Some say we're headed
to a solar minimum,

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:11.926 align:middle line:90%
others say we're at a maximum.

00:45:11.926 --> 00:45:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: No one can agree.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when we look
at all of this, yeah,

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.390 align:middle line:84%
I think I just find it
fascinating that you're putting

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:22.450 align:middle line:84%
phenomena together
with all of this--

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:25.600 align:middle line:84%
these Earth energetic
expressions, shall we say?

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, thanks.

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:31.570 align:middle line:84%
It really comes down to Kathy
having seen the pattern.

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:35.350 align:middle line:84%
We were talking before
we came in to do this.

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:37.340 align:middle line:84%
She had seen a pattern
on rocks and found

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:39.050 align:middle line:90%
lost cities because of it.

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:40.670 align:middle line:90%
She's very good at this.

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She is.

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:43.000 align:middle line:90%
She's a smart cookie.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.002 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, she is.

00:45:44.002 --> 00:45:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And she just does research
like you wouldn't believe.

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:47.400 align:middle line:90%
She does.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:50.100 align:middle line:90%
I love her.

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.525 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: This was not
something that I was--

00:45:52.525 --> 00:45:55.053 align:middle line:84%
you know, I wasn't
thinking in lines of this.

00:45:55.053 --> 00:45:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
nobody was really.

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:57.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I wasn't either.

00:45:57.610 --> 00:45:59.530 align:middle line:84%
But when you talk
about it now, it

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:02.020 align:middle line:84%
seems like it's just kind
of hiding in plain sight.

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Of course anomalous
things would happen

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.180 align:middle line:84%
where you have explosions of
anomalous energy, electrical

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:08.980 align:middle line:90%
or magnetic.

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:10.522 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And you
can look at the maps

00:46:10.522 --> 00:46:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and see that there is
definitely something there.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:16.870 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain it?

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Not sure, but there's got
to be some bits and pieces

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:24.910 align:middle line:84%
of strangeness that
can be plugged together

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:28.270 align:middle line:84%
into this jigsaw puzzle that can
make a little bit more sense.

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:31.885 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
working theory right now.

00:46:31.885 --> 00:46:33.078 align:middle line:90%
It's in progress.

00:46:33.078 --> 00:46:34.870 align:middle line:84%
We're just bringing it
all up for everybody

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:36.910 align:middle line:84%
to consider and add
their own pieces to.

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:39.395 align:middle line:84%
But let's take a quick look
at the Joplin Spook Lights,

00:46:39.395 --> 00:46:41.020 align:middle line:84%
because we've mentioned
it a few times.

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:42.730 align:middle line:84%
We have a little
bit of film here

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and some people that
were observing it

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.097 align:middle line:84%
and got their camera
out and, of course,

00:46:46.097 --> 00:46:47.443 align:middle line:90%
were startled and surprised.

00:46:47.443 --> 00:46:49.360 align:middle line:10%
>>MAN 1: When you're not
looking through that,

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.930 align:middle line:10%
sometimes you've got
to strain to see it.

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:53.882 align:middle line:10%
But yet on here--

00:46:53.882 --> 00:46:55.340 align:middle line:10%
>>MAN 2: It's got
two lights again.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.140 align:middle line:10%
Wait a minute.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:57.650 align:middle line:10%
One little one.

00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:58.450 align:middle line:10%
Wait.

00:46:58.450 --> 00:46:59.270 align:middle line:10%
Maybe three.

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:00.070 align:middle line:10%
Hang on.

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:01.030 align:middle line:10%
Hang on.

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:03.010 align:middle line:10%
OK, wow.

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:04.430 align:middle line:10%
It's got one ahead of it.

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:08.200 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's getting really,
really bright, real bright.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.500 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's got one ahead
of it, way ahead of it.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:14.661 align:middle line:10%
Might be coming up the road.

00:47:14.661 --> 00:47:15.595 align:middle line:10%
Hang on now.

00:47:15.595 --> 00:47:18.400 align:middle line:10%


00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.630 align:middle line:10%
>>MAN 1: I see three lights.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:21.790 align:middle line:10%
>>MAN 2: Yeah, there's one
behind the bigger light.

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:24.901 align:middle line:90%


00:47:24.901 --> 00:47:28.400 align:middle line:10%
There's multiple
lights there right now.

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.490 align:middle line:10%
OK, now I'm seeing--

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:35.480 align:middle line:10%
oh, I can't tell.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:36.280 align:middle line:10%
I'm not sure.

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:39.250 align:middle line:90%


00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:40.337 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:40.337 --> 00:47:42.670 align:middle line:10%
There's one little light that
went into the bigger light

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:45.820 align:middle line:10%
to the left.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So Jerry, I mean a lot
of people say, what are those?

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:51.640 align:middle line:84%
UFOs, or is there something
out in the forest there?

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: First off,
that flashing light--

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.440 align:middle line:90%
we were there.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Kathy and I went there
to do a story about this.

00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:00.070 align:middle line:84%
That isn't our tape, of
course, but we went there.

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:02.792 align:middle line:84%
And that flashing light is
from a cell phone tower.

00:48:02.792 --> 00:48:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I would
think that it would be.

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:07.040 align:middle line:84%
It looks-- that looks--
it's such a regular pulse.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And it's red, and
that's why it looks so bright.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.640 align:middle line:84%
The other lights you
see there are really

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.550 align:middle line:84%
from where I imagine
these guys are,

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:19.930 align:middle line:84%
it's probably 1,500
feet from them.

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And those lights are
not red, and they're

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:26.170 align:middle line:84%
showing up a little
different on this video,

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:27.318 align:middle line:90%
because they're not red.

00:48:27.318 --> 00:48:29.360 align:middle line:84%
They don't look as bright
as that flashing light.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.830 align:middle line:84%
But they are anywhere
from a yellowish orange

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:36.280 align:middle line:84%
light to where they
fully bloom out

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes like
a piece of magnesium,

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:42.310 align:middle line:84%
like a welder's arc,
that kind of brightness.

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:44.300 align:middle line:84%
When we were there,
I wanted to find out

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:47.040 align:middle line:84%
if someone was down
there goofing with us.

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And there was other
people there too,

00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and people always go
looking, you know?

00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:57.310 align:middle line:84%
So I took a radio, and I
told Kathy, keep filming.

00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:59.215 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to walk down
there and find out

00:48:59.215 --> 00:49:01.180 align:middle line:90%
if somebody's down there.

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I went walking down there,
and there was those lights

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:05.890 align:middle line:90%
just right over there.

00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:07.810 align:middle line:90%
So I just go after it.

00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:10.630 align:middle line:84%
I get a little closer, and
it goes out and reappears off

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:12.010 align:middle line:90%
to my right.

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:13.480 align:middle line:90%
Just that fast.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:15.740 align:middle line:90%
Boom, just like that.

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.440 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's strange.

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:20.185 align:middle line:84%
So I started hollering at
it like maybe it was people.

00:49:20.185 --> 00:49:21.010 align:middle line:90%
I listened.

00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:22.690 align:middle line:90%
There's no sound.

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:24.470 align:middle line:90%
And then, boom, boom.

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:26.252 align:middle line:84%
From there to there,
to there to there.

00:49:26.252 --> 00:49:27.460 align:middle line:90%
And then there's two of them.

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.770 align:middle line:90%
There's three of them.

00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
way to explain it.

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:34.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:36.875 align:middle line:84%
It is really a
tremendous mystery.

00:49:36.875 --> 00:49:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I assume they're
called spook lights because it

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:40.348 align:middle line:90%
spooks people.

00:49:40.348 --> 00:49:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, they
all have stories.

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:43.330 align:middle line:90%
It does spook people.

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, back in the
1800s, when settlers--

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.810 align:middle line:84%
rather, early 1800s,
when settlers first

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:52.130 align:middle line:84%
went into this
area, the native--

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:55.345 align:middle line:84%
the Indians there,
they knew about it.

00:49:55.345 --> 00:49:57.470 align:middle line:84%
They had their own stories
of why it was happening.

00:49:57.470 --> 00:50:01.610 align:middle line:84%
No one really knows
why it's happening.

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you
progress all around,

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.370 align:middle line:84%
people get spooked by it
and it's a Spook Light.

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:09.990 align:middle line:84%
But there's a reason
why it's occurring.

00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what the reason is,

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:15.790 align:middle line:84%
but I've seen those same
lights around Machu Picchu,

00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:19.360 align:middle line:84%
around Huyana Picchu, and a
lot of other places in Peru

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.322 align:middle line:84%
moving through the
Andes Mountains.

00:50:21.322 --> 00:50:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're
a different color

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:27.320 align:middle line:84%
than just the orangish yellow
or yellow or brilliant white.

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.590 align:middle line:84%
But in the instance
of all of them,

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:32.170 align:middle line:84%
they're just completely
unexplainable.

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:35.807 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, is
there a relationship?

00:50:35.807 --> 00:50:37.640 align:middle line:10%
Remember I showed you
the map of the craton.

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.265 align:middle line:10%
There's a little part
there from Texas,

00:50:39.265 --> 00:50:41.470 align:middle line:10%
comes up, a little dip up.

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:43.780 align:middle line:10%
That's right there.

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.480 align:middle line:10%
That energy is being
released right there.

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So is there a
relationship to it?

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:52.872 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, I'm
really curious to find out.

00:50:52.872 --> 00:50:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what a
wonderful time and place

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:56.290 align:middle line:90%
we live in right now.

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:57.883 align:middle line:90%
And it's not all spooky.

00:50:57.883 --> 00:51:00.050 align:middle line:84%
You were telling me on the
phone about a woman named

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Molly, who has a different
kind of experience.

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:06.190 align:middle line:84%
She has a different
experience with Sasquatch.

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, well and
this was kind of a fun thing

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.020 align:middle line:84%
she was telling us is that
her children are walking

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:16.180 align:middle line:84%
from school, coming back
home, and that periodically,

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.450 align:middle line:84%
there would be rocks
thrown at them.

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Not in a malicious way but
just like a playful way.

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:24.460 align:middle line:90%
And of course, it was Sasquatch.

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And so the kids would
just really get the idea,

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:27.990 align:middle line:90%
well, get out of here.

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And Mom would tell them, this
is probably what's going on.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.400 align:middle line:84%
As the children
grew up, one of them

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.725 align:middle line:90%
got a bit more persnickety.

00:51:34.725 --> 00:51:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So he picked up a rock and
started throwing it back

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:38.320 align:middle line:90%
at him.

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And then pretty soon, the rock
would be thrown back at him.

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And so he went around to
try and catch up with him.

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And they did this
chase scene of sorts,

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:52.550 align:middle line:84%
but they never really caught
up with each other at all.

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:55.450 align:middle line:84%
But it was just an
amazing story of how

00:51:55.450 --> 00:51:59.530 align:middle line:84%
there, Sasquatch, Bigfoot,
whatever they call them there,

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:06.430 align:middle line:84%
they're not seen as something
that is malicious or dangerous.

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:09.100 align:middle line:84%
They're just these other
people that they're

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.647 align:middle line:90%
sharing the land with.

00:52:10.647 --> 00:52:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
that's a good way to put it.

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:15.042 align:middle line:84%
They are a strain of
people just like we are.

00:52:15.042 --> 00:52:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, exactly.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.208 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're their own--

00:52:17.208 --> 00:52:20.833 align:middle line:84%
they're their own genetic
lineage from long ago.

00:52:20.833 --> 00:52:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And from a lot of folks
that I've spoken to, who've had

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:27.130 align:middle line:84%
ongoing encounters, whether
it's Native Americans or just

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:30.070 align:middle line:84%
individuals outside
of that community,

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:32.460 align:middle line:90%
they all say the same thing--

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:36.050 align:middle line:84%
that they're telepathic,
that they're not malicious,

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:39.015 align:middle line:84%
that they don't really
like being around humans.

00:52:39.015 --> 00:52:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They have even
come to the aid of humans.

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:43.683 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, they
have and other animals.

00:52:43.683 --> 00:52:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And other
animals, yeah.

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So there's nothing
mean about them at all.

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I don't get--

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:53.000 align:middle line:84%
scary vibe doesn't
work for me and trying

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.310 align:middle line:90%
to create fight scenarios.

00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But I guarantee, if
you see one the first time,

00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:57.160 align:middle line:90%
it'll stop you.

00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:58.827 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm sure
it would startle you.

00:52:58.827 --> 00:53:02.480 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] OK, I'll got to tell
you this silly little thing.

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.880 align:middle line:90%
So I had--

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:06.950 align:middle line:84%
I have this Airstream
we just bought.

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And I just can't
wait to wake up--

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:10.547 align:middle line:84%
and I did it because I want
to wake up in the trees.

00:53:10.547 --> 00:53:13.810 align:middle line:84%
I just can't get enough tree
energy right now, right?

00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:17.740 align:middle line:84%
So we went up to Shasta to
meet a couple of people, really

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:19.790 align:middle line:84%
more business
acquaintances for business.

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:23.080 align:middle line:84%
But they were attending
a Sasquatch conference

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.783 align:middle line:90%
with a guy named Ted.

00:53:24.783 --> 00:53:26.950 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well, I should
probably just introduce

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:28.540 align:middle line:90%
myself and say hi.

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:30.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm in this general community.

00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Ted said, oh, yes,
you can join us.

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:34.750 align:middle line:90%
Very sweet man.

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:36.100 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sure, just come up.

00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a very
organized thing.

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look,
they're talking to me

00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:40.780 align:middle line:90%
right now as we're speaking.

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And Sasquatch is telling
me they'd really like it

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:46.330 align:middle line:84%
if you would bring them
cinnamon buns with lots

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:47.830 align:middle line:90%
of frosting on it.

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:50.170 align:middle line:90%
I thought, OK.

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:51.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm a good sport.

00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:52.080 align:middle line:90%
I say yes to everything.

00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.560 align:middle line:90%
I thought, hey, I'm headed up.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make
his acquaintance.

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:56.300 align:middle line:90%
You know, why not?

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.630 align:middle line:84%
So I had to go to the local
bakery and I picked up--

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:02.230 align:middle line:84%
preordered a big stack of
boxes full of cinnamon buns.

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:03.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:05.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm guessing Ted and the
people that follow him probably

00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:06.733 align:middle line:90%
ate them the next morning.

00:54:06.733 --> 00:54:09.670 align:middle line:84%
But I did leave them there
at the campsite that he says

00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:13.010 align:middle line:84%
is a Sasquatch highway and
food disappears all the time.

00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So I did my part in trying
to fulfill a Sasquatch

00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:20.170 align:middle line:84%
dream, according to Ted is
to have a human sticky bun

00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:22.387 align:middle line:90%
with frosting on it.

00:54:22.387 --> 00:54:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: You know, I
have the same penchant.

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:27.132 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you want to leave
it towards the river

00:54:27.132 --> 00:54:29.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm going down.

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:30.437 align:middle line:90%
I am a Bigfoot.

00:54:30.437 --> 00:54:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I haven't heard
whether they showed up or not.

00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:35.410 align:middle line:84%
That was just a couple days
ago, and here I am now.

00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:37.075 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, there's
one phenomenon

00:54:37.075 --> 00:54:38.210 align:middle line:90%
I always wondered about.

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think you were
around Sedona at that time.

00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:43.990 align:middle line:84%
You might have been
living up in Jerome.

00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:47.740 align:middle line:84%
But this was probably
15 years ago now.

00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Went outside, and all
around town, traffic

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:53.200 align:middle line:84%
was stopped at this time
because at the coffee shop

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:55.450 align:middle line:84%
the next morning everyone
was talking about it.

00:54:55.450 --> 00:55:00.820 align:middle line:84%
The entire sky in Sedona
turned bright red,

00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:03.040 align:middle line:84%
almost like a deep,
blood bright red.

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.378 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I remember that.

00:55:04.378 --> 00:55:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there
were white spokes

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:08.140 align:middle line:90%
that started coming down.

00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:09.700 align:middle line:90%
What the heck was that?

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:12.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, no one could
ever explain that one.

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:13.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm still looking for an answer.

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:16.372 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, you know from
Jerome, it wasn't visible.

00:55:16.372 --> 00:55:17.490 align:middle line:90%
We didn't see it.

00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, you didn't.

00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.180 align:middle line:90%
You had to be in Sedona.

00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Had to be in
that sphere of area.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that was.

00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
literally breathtaking.

00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Everyone stopped
what they were doing

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and just stood like the
Earth had stood still.

00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I have a photograph.

00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:37.260 align:middle line:84%
It shows this huge ship sort of
thing coming out of the clouds

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:38.550 align:middle line:90%
when that happened.

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:39.615 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:55:39.615 --> 00:55:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would make
sense, because I hadn't

00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:42.698 align:middle line:90%
heard that part of the story.

00:55:42.698 --> 00:55:45.730 align:middle line:84%
No one talked about any ships,
which is common talk in Sedona.

00:55:45.730 --> 00:55:47.522 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Actually, I
got it from Tom Dongo.

00:55:47.522 --> 00:55:48.563 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, from Dongo.

00:55:48.563 --> 00:55:49.560 align:middle line:90%
OK, that makes sense.

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:52.260 align:middle line:84%
All right, so it might
have been an emanation.

00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:54.177 align:middle line:84%
Because there were--
after the sky turned red,

00:55:54.177 --> 00:55:56.135 align:middle line:84%
there were these white
rays projected downward.

00:55:56.135 --> 00:55:57.927 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, I remember
when it happened.

00:55:57.927 --> 00:55:59.210 align:middle line:90%
We had received a phone call.

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:01.665 align:middle line:84%
And we were looking like,
what are you talking about?

00:56:01.665 --> 00:56:03.090 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing going on there.

00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it
was very pronounced.

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:07.590 align:middle line:84%
I was standing in
my front walkway.

00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Jerry, again, we always
have so much fun.

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And this was a wonderful
melee of just tossing ideas

00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:17.070 align:middle line:84%
into the pot to
seeing what can happen

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:21.570 align:middle line:84%
when you put this kind of
energy together with phenomena.

00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:23.080 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like
anything's possible.

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sounds like it.

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And well, we're going
to try to figure it out.

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:28.738 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying we will.

00:56:28.738 --> 00:56:30.488 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but
you're onto something.

00:56:30.488 --> 00:56:31.980 align:middle line:84%
You've gotten all
of us thinking.

00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:34.397 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, and it's good,
because the more people that

00:56:34.397 --> 00:56:36.120 align:middle line:84%
are thinking in
this direction, you

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.610 align:middle line:84%
can start coming up
with your own ideas.

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:41.580 align:middle line:84%
We have, in our
Patreon community,

00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:45.690 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of folks now,
and they're getting the data.

00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're helping to piece
together this jigsaw puzzle

00:56:49.210 --> 00:56:50.325 align:middle line:90%
and share with us.

00:56:50.325 --> 00:56:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're sharing with
them, and we're trying

00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.320 align:middle line:90%
to figure it out together.

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:54.060 align:middle line:90%
So it's pretty nice.

00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
you'll be hearing

00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:57.390 align:middle line:84%
more from the Gaia community
watching this show too.

00:56:57.390 --> 00:56:58.932 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I think
that would be great.

00:56:58.932 --> 00:57:00.780 align:middle line:10%
Because the folks
that watch this show,

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:02.880 align:middle line:10%
we've been all over the world.

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:08.060 align:middle line:10%
They love you, and this show
is their number one go-to show.

00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I love it.

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing that.

00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:11.910 align:middle line:90%
Makes my day.

00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:13.560 align:middle line:90%
Jerry, thanks until next time.

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:16.050 align:middle line:84%
I'll probably be talking
to you before we come back

00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:17.085 align:middle line:90%
on set together again.

00:57:17.085 --> 00:57:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And we'll hook up somewhere
besides Georgie's Cafe over

00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:21.085 align:middle line:90%
in Cottonwood.

00:57:21.085 --> 00:57:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like that's
a thing of the past.

00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:23.760 align:middle line:90%
Thanks again, Jerry.

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:24.420 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:25.220 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:26.160 align:middle line:90%
It's always fun.

00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:28.720 align:middle line:10%
Again, Jerry never ceases to
produce fascinating stories

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:29.520 align:middle line:10%
for us.

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:31.500 align:middle line:10%
And you can continue

00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:33.790 align:middle line:10%

00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:37.020 align:middle line:10%
You can hook up with his live
shows there and his community.
