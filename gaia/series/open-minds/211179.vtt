00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a time
of savage grace.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.090 align:middle line:90%
If you want awakening--

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.890 align:middle line:90%
Savage grace, yes.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Because this time, we'll
strip you of your fantasies

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.500 align:middle line:84%
and illusions and offer you
a path to radical union with

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.300 align:middle line:90%
the divine.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.530 align:middle line:90%
If you're brave enough.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.890 align:middle line:84%
The great Hindu mystics tell
us that there are four stages.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Difficult, serious,
dangerous, and then lethal.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.009 align:middle line:90%
>> Where are we on that scale?

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.579 align:middle line:90%
>> We're in dangerous.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Oh, dangerous.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>> --On the cusp of lethal.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a dying and a
birthing at the same time.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of the birthing
because that will give you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.790 align:middle line:90%
purpose, meaning, and joy.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.700 align:middle line:84%
The triumph of the
depravity of lies

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.270 align:middle line:84%
is a sign that extinction is
now possible for the human race.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>> If we don't get real.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm here to help
people, at this moment,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.330 align:middle line:84%
die into life so that
they can know what I am.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.340 align:middle line:84%
So many of us now know which is
that there is a new life coming

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.540 align:middle line:90%
for the world.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.322 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.322 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Andrew Harvey is

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:10%
a mystic who believes that our
shadow is our greatest ally,

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.360 align:middle line:10%
and the only path forward
is to make friends with it.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the one
thing many people

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.620 align:middle line:84%
in the spiritual communities
want to avoid like the plague.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.380 align:middle line:90%
But look around the world.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Truth time.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.560 align:middle line:84%
It's so good to see
you again, Andrew.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.210 align:middle line:90%
It's been a few years.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW HARVEY: It has
but how lovely to be back.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.102 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I have
to say, because it's

00:01:33.102 --> 00:01:36.500 align:middle line:84%
been a few years, that means we
have all, a big new audience.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.010 align:middle line:90%
And I can't help myself.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:84%
I have to share how I first
saw you, met you, and fell

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.310 align:middle line:90%
in love with you.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.847 align:middle line:90%
It was at a New Age conference.

00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Oh, my goodness.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I believe
it was in Vancouver, BC.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And Barbara Marx
Hubbard, a lot of them.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Oh, God.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.780 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that one.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Jose Arguelles
and others were there,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.420 align:middle line:84%
and you got up and
spoke toward the end.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't-- I'd
heard of the great,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.920 align:middle line:84%
mystic and orator Andrew
Harvey, but I didn't know what

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:90%
to expect.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's say, you
silenced the room.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.860 align:middle line:84%
You weren't silent, but
the room became silent.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And you basically said,
there's no daydream meditation

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.930 align:middle line:84%
or Rainbow Bridge that's going
to get us where we need to go.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:84%
You have to do the
work, and we are not

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:90%
doing the work in this room.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And you went on,
and it was like--

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.000 align:middle line:90%
everyone was like this.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.295 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, my
God, he speaks the truth.

00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:32.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.010 align:middle line:90%
So I immediately had to--

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.470 align:middle line:84%
I came up to you and said,
may I interview you right now?

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.810 align:middle line:84%
You were perspiring, and
everyone was in shock.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And I said, let's
go do this now.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And you were kind enough
to grant me an interview.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Oh, God.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.190 align:middle line:90%
I never forget it.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No one will
forget that, Andrew.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Absolutely.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, Andrew,
you're a passionate man.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.170 align:middle line:90%
You're a mystical man.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.420 align:middle line:84%
You have a huge heart
and are full of love,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.090 align:middle line:84%
but you also see the
danger and the times we're

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.660 align:middle line:84%
in, which you're calling a
really dark night of the soul.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Evolutionarily for
humanity, we all

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.240 align:middle line:90%
chose to be here at this time.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.680 align:middle line:90%
So, please.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Well, first of
all, it's absolutely lovely

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:84%
to be with you again because
I remember our meeting also

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.670 align:middle line:90%
with great joy.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
wild interview--

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: That followed.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:25.270 align:middle line:10%
You know, this is the worst
and the best of times.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.290 align:middle line:10%
It's terrifying because
the entire world,

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:10%
the whole of humanity
is being plunged

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.290 align:middle line:10%
into a global dark night.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.270 align:middle line:10%
A series of unspeakably
difficult crises, all of which

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:10%
are manifesting
at the same time.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:84%
But for those of
us who are mystics

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and who've been through
dark nights ourselves, when

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.710 align:middle line:84%
a dark night of such
intensity appears,

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.980 align:middle line:84%
we know that something
amazing is being prepared.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.890 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
great evolutionary mystics

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.160 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, they
all know that we

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.590 align:middle line:84%
were going to come
to a period like this

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.420 align:middle line:84%
because we've been living in
hubris, fantasy, and delusion.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.780 align:middle line:84%
But they also all know that
this crisis has been perfectly

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:30.380 align:middle line:84%
designed by sublime, divine
intelligence to burn away

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.840 align:middle line:84%
our illusions, to initiate us
into the truth of who we are,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.850 align:middle line:84%
and to help us come together
to co-create a wholly,

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.860 align:middle line:90%
new way of being and doing--

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, I think
it's important for us

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.320 align:middle line:84%
to keep in mind that our
souls-- we chose this.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:84%
We chose to be
incarnate right now.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.100 align:middle line:90%
Everyone.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.950 align:middle line:84%
People can say, oh, I would
have never chosen this,

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.660 align:middle line:84%
or what a horrid
time to be alive.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.890 align:middle line:90%
No, you chose it.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: But you
chose it for a reason.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We all
chose it for a reason.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.078 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: The real
reason I believe

00:05:02.078 --> 00:05:05.030 align:middle line:84%
is that this is a
time of savage grace.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:90%
If you want awakening--

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Savage grace.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: --here's the
time because this time,

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.770 align:middle line:84%
we'll strip you of your
fantasies and illusions

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and offer you a path to
radical union with the divine.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.650 align:middle line:84%
If you're brave enough,
if you're wild enough,

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.570 align:middle line:84%
if you do the work, this time,
we'll give you everything.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Radical grace?

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:26.850 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.480 align:middle line:84%
So the way you describe
the dark night of the soul

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.540 align:middle line:84%
is when you've come to a
point, where life is now-- you

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.310 align:middle line:84%
can't find the
meaning to it anymore.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's a kind of
malaise and depression

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.600 align:middle line:90%
that overcomes humanity.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.490 align:middle line:90%
And we're seeing a lot of that.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of suicide.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of every
kind of substance--

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Violence.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --abuse on the planet.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.357 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Growth of
authoritarianism.

00:05:48.357 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All of it.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Paralysis.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so most people
or people here are awake.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.260 align:middle line:84%
The people watching you
now are awake but also,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:84%
not knowing how to
proceed forward.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:84%
We've come out of the dark night
of the pandemic, where people

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.860 align:middle line:84%
had been siloed themselves
into taking positions, choosing

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.410 align:middle line:90%
sides and hating on one another.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: I know.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.877 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is the
worst part of all.

00:06:13.877 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:84%
So, talk about that for just
a moment, about the division

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.060 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, and being
pitted against each other

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:90%
through media and social media.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to
go into the fact

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.660 align:middle line:84%
that this is actually
an initiatory process.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.410 align:middle line:90%
And we'll talk about it.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Well, one way of
looking at this dark night

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.340 align:middle line:84%
is looking at it as
the Hindu mystics asked

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.340 align:middle line:90%
us to look at it, as Kali Yuga.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And the great Hindu mystics tell
us that there are four stages.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.718 align:middle line:84%
Difficult, serious,
dangerous, and then lethal.

00:06:46.718 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where are
we on that scale?

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: We're in the last--

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lethal.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: --part of dangerous.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.765 align:middle line:90%
Oh, dangerous.

00:06:50.765 --> 00:06:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: We're on
the cusp of lethal.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.410 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: So in this stage--

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:90%
and this is known.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.470 align:middle line:90%
They've written about it.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:84%
In this stage, there's
terrible division.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.986 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everything has stages.

00:07:00.986 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:90%
Waves of consciousness.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:90%
Up and down.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Up and down.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And in this stage,
there's going to be

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.220 align:middle line:84%
terrible suffering,
terrible division,

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.037 align:middle line:84%
people hating each other
for a ridiculous reasons.

00:07:10.037 --> 00:07:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's cosmic.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: And it's cosmic.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not just here.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: It's not just here.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.435 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So go ahead.

00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: It's a process.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: And it's
a process which

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.150 align:middle line:84%
is designed to
really wake people up

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.350 align:middle line:84%
to the necessity of diving
deep into mystical practice,

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.990 align:middle line:84%
so that they can find
out who they really are,

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:35.510 align:middle line:84%
and go forward in sacred,
compassionate action

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.900 align:middle line:84%
to help build a wholly
new way of living.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to get very much
worse even than it is now.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.450 align:middle line:90%
Alas.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: But it has to
because we're incredibly sick.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And the horror that
we're going through

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.890 align:middle line:84%
is chemotherapy for the cancer
of selfishness and divisiveness

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.680 align:middle line:84%
that unfortunately, we
become possessed by.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.220 align:middle line:84%
But when you know what
the dark night truly is,

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.100 align:middle line:84%
which is a birthing
process, that

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.380 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean you just relax.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
you just say, oh,

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.280 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be born
naturally, the new humanity.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.155 align:middle line:84%
It means that you dedicate
your whole being--

00:08:12.155 --> 00:08:14.322 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, your
consciousness, awareness...

00:08:14.322 --> 00:08:17.353 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: --to the new birth
that is trying to come through.

00:08:17.353 --> 00:08:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Major
course correction.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:19.645 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Everything.

00:08:19.645 --> 00:08:22.027 align:middle line:84%
A major course correction in
every aspect of your life.

00:08:22.027 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're
watching it in institutions.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.553 align:middle line:84%
And as the astrology
is lining up,

00:08:25.553 --> 00:08:27.470 align:middle line:84%
it looks like we have a
lot more change ahead.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Oh, yes.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For several
more years at least,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.659 align:middle line:84%
in the falling of institutions
that we're familiar with.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:33.860 align:middle line:90%
And we depend upon it even.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yes.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.114 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
have to transform.

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: --just
about the darkness.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.299 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about
all the wonderful light

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:90%
that's appearing too.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.520 align:middle line:84%
The amazing new visions of the
future that people are having.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.620 align:middle line:90%
The breakthroughs in energy.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.200 align:middle line:84%
We can dwell too
much on the darkness.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.030 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
see it and face it,

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.870 align:middle line:84%
but let's look at all
the light coming through.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:53.670 align:middle line:90%
It has to.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.143 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it
has to break down

00:08:54.143 --> 00:08:55.760 align:middle line:84%
to let the new come in.This is
just a natural process, just

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.120 align:middle line:90%
like cellular growth and death.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yes.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To be replaced
with fresh cells in our body.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.930 align:middle line:90%
So we have to say, it's OK.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.530 align:middle line:84%
We have to be OK with what
falls apart in our lives,

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.473 align:middle line:84%
and then be ready to be a
co-creator in what we're

00:09:09.473 --> 00:09:10.640 align:middle line:90%
going to be giving birth to.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.810 align:middle line:84%
But the co-creation part
is really important.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:13.940 align:middle line:90%
That's action.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: That's
the crucial plot.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, "Radical
Regeneration," your book.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.480 align:middle line:10%
Your other one I did with
you was "Radical Passion."

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yes.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're about action.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Yes, it's very
easy to dwell on the dark,

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.830 align:middle line:84%
but what I encourage
people to do

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.470 align:middle line:84%
is to develop what
I call "birth eyes."

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.290 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of all this
madness and chaos and horror

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.710 align:middle line:84%
are appearing extraordinary
new visions of the future.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Amazing breakthroughs
in new energy.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Extraordinary,
ordinary human beings

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.220 align:middle line:84%
who are risking their
lives to stand up

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.350 align:middle line:84%
for democracy and justice
such as the women in Iran.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: So what
this process is--

00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:00.380 align:middle line:84%
it's a dying and a
birthing at the same time.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of the birthing
because that will give you

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.600 align:middle line:90%
purpose, meaning, and joy.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And dedicate yourself to be one
of the birthers in whatever way

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.612 align:middle line:90%
that is most natural to you.

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're just divine.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:14.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Everything you say has
truth, but it's golden

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.360 align:middle line:84%
because it has that
mystic quality to it.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And you say when we go through
this kind of mass depression

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:84%
of sorts, during the breakdown,
during these periods,

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:84%
it's a chance for us to
look at the repressed

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:84%
contents of our
subconscious mind

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.120 align:middle line:84%
because they're now
going to show themselves.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Everything's
going to come up

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.790 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to
discover that you never

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.115 align:middle line:84%
were as righteous as
you thought you were.

00:10:43.115 --> 00:10:44.782 align:middle line:84%
That there were lots
of hidden motives--

00:10:44.782 --> 00:10:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's disappointing.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: That's-- no, it's
exciting because it made you

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:84%
feel separate and
spoiled and wonderful.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And let's get real, we need to
all be far more compassionate.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, in
the New Age community

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:01.790 align:middle line:84%
is particularly complicit in
that the way it was run before.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.497 align:middle line:84%
And that is also
coming to pass now.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: I hope so.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: It needs to go
through a massive revolution.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, a mature act
and action-oriented spiritual

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:84%
process is what's replacing
it now and getting like you

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.130 align:middle line:90%
say, roll the sleeves up.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And start letting the
unconscious contents

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.750 align:middle line:84%
show themselves to you and
the less flattering sides--

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yes

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --of our own character
that need this maturation.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: But there's
tremendous energy hidden

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:90%
in those repressed sides.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Hidden energy of passion and
hidden energy of compassion.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Because so many people
went on the spiritual path

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.600 align:middle line:90%
to feel superior.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Mother's organized
this terrible crisis in which

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:90%
we are all feeling at a loss.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:90%
So we are all being humbled.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.720 align:middle line:84%
We are all being
more compassionate

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.890 align:middle line:84%
because we realize that
others are suffering also.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: And that gives us
a new level of skillful means

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:55.685 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:11:55.685 --> 00:11:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: We can face
each other as human beings

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.520 align:middle line:84%
and reach out and
say, what do you need?

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.920 align:middle line:90%
What are you battling with?

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:90%
This is what I am battling with.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.490 align:middle line:90%
Does it resonate with you?

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's help each other
get through this.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the
confounding parts of it

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.350 align:middle line:84%
is in this kind of
spoiled character

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:22.610 align:middle line:84%
that humanity has taken on in
recent times in this decline

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:26.150 align:middle line:84%
to awaken us is that
we've untethered ourselves

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.220 align:middle line:90%
from objective truth.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yeah, oh, God.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're now
in a post-truth world.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And you and I are
both very concerned

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and passionate about
this topic, so please.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Well, the triumph
of the depravity of lies

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:44.508 align:middle line:84%
is a sign that extinction is
now possible for the human race.

00:12:44.508 --> 00:12:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: If we don't get real.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.092 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: If we don't get real.

00:12:47.092 --> 00:12:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't agree on
some established facts.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.030 align:middle line:84%
We have to agree that
there is a climate crisis.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.660 align:middle line:84%
We have to agree
that capitalism,

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.690 align:middle line:84%
in its current manifestation,
just isn't working.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:03.860 align:middle line:84%
There are too many people living
in too dreadful circumstances.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:84%
We have to agree that we
cannot go on treating animals

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.960 align:middle line:84%
in the way that we're doing
because a million species are

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.250 align:middle line:90%
on the verge of total vanishing.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:21.260 align:middle line:84%
So unless the truth, which
is very difficult to face

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.230 align:middle line:84%
gets through to us, we
won't be able to work

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:84%
with what we need to work
with to build a new world.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.605 align:middle line:84%
You can't build a new world
out of lies and out of denial.

00:13:31.605 --> 00:13:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: You can only
build a new world out

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:84%
of facing where you are, going
very deep into yourself to find

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.770 align:middle line:84%
the divine consciousness that
we're all secretly one with,

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and coming together
in sacred action.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.330 align:middle line:90%
That's the way forward.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:84%
But you're going--
a word pops up

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.510 align:middle line:90%
that people utter all the time.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:58.850 align:middle line:84%
When you take the totality
of it in, you're overwhelmed.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.560 align:middle line:90%
You think, oh, my God.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.000 align:middle line:84%
There's too much
to even look at.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:90%
All I can do is just--

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.270 align:middle line:84%
let me do my little part well,
and let other people address

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:09.510 align:middle line:90%
the bigger issues.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, now on one hand, there
are people who were born to

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and designed to take on the big
issues and move them forward.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.410 align:middle line:84%
But you say that everyone
needs to be aware and do

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.690 align:middle line:90%
a little part, even a tiny part.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: When people say
to me, oh, I don't think I

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.440 align:middle line:90%
can take on all of this.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.100 align:middle line:84%
I say to them
tenderly but firmly,

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.660 align:middle line:84%
you tremendously
underestimate yourself--

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: --because you don't
yet know who you really are.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:42.050 align:middle line:84%
If you took your spiritual
practice more seriously,

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:84%
the divine is ready to flood
you with power and strength

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:51.710 align:middle line:84%
on a level that you
cannot yet imagine.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:84%
I know this from my own
life because in order

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.350 align:middle line:84%
to be the kind of teacher
that I've tried to be,

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.930 align:middle line:84%
to bring what I hope
is the truth to people,

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:04.040 align:middle line:84%
I've gone through many multiple
hells and great sufferings.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:09.230 align:middle line:84%
But I have always been saved,
helped, redeemed, transformed,

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:10.980 align:middle line:84%
and given the strength
to go forward.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:90%
So I know whereof I speak.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:84%
So I am just saying
to people, I get

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:84%
why you feel paralyzed
and despairing

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:23.300 align:middle line:84%
but have faith in the great
message of the great mystics.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Have faith in
spiritual practice.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.780 align:middle line:90%
You will find.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.670 align:middle line:84%
You won't be
overwhelmed by what's

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.880 align:middle line:84%
happening because you
realize that what's happening

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.720 align:middle line:84%
is happening out of
a fierce love that

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.910 align:middle line:84%
truly wants one humanity to end
so that another can be born.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And participate in that birth
and you'll have more joy

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.340 align:middle line:90%
than you can stand.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So true.

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.700 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
connecting with source.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.528 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Connecting with source
and connecting with each other.

00:15:52.528 --> 00:15:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And each other.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: And each other.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And we don't--

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.720 align:middle line:84%
unless you've had a near-death
experience or a Kundalini

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.200 align:middle line:84%
awakening, almost all of which
happens accidentally to people,

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.380 align:middle line:84%
most people have not
experienced that rush

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.500 align:middle line:84%
that you're speaking of, of all
of the support and energy that

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.665 align:middle line:90%
comes in when it's needed.

00:16:10.665 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: --they can.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:11.750 align:middle line:90%
Nothing--

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.160 align:middle line:90%
It's all right there.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.300 align:middle line:90%
You can call it in.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Yes, you can
start doing practices.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.840 align:middle line:90%
Just start one.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Just say the name of God by
whatever name you love God.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.200 align:middle line:84%
You'll find that if
you do it sincerely,

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle line:84%
it will open doors you
didn't even know existed.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: There are such
powerful simple practices

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:84%
which if people get with them
right now instead of feeling

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.730 align:middle line:84%
depleted and paralyzed
and in denial,

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.800 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that you'll
be given the strength

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.360 align:middle line:90%
to stand what's happening.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.510 align:middle line:84%
You'll be given the insight
that a birth is being prepared,

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:48.810 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be given the energy
to go forward and do things

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.397 align:middle line:84%
that you never imagined
that you were capable of.

00:16:51.397 --> 00:16:52.480 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you one example.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
going to ask you for one.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:54.660 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: I've been to this
amazing country called Namibia,

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.560 align:middle line:90%
which has taken my breath away.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.510 align:middle line:90%
It's astounding.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.290 align:middle line:84%
It's naked glory, and
it's God without clothes.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Beyond dogma.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just the most
amazing place.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:12.119 align:middle line:84%
And I heard of a
person there called--

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:13.839 align:middle line:90%
I won't mention her name.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:84%
But what she decided
years ago, 10 years ago--

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.150 align:middle line:90%
she was in Minnesota.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.140 align:middle line:84%
She was living an ordinary kind
of life, and she was happy.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And then she saw
that all the cheetahs

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.033 align:middle line:90%
were disappearing in Namibia.

00:17:25.033 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, for no
reason, she decided

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.158 align:middle line:84%
she was going to
save the cheetahs.

00:17:28.158 --> 00:17:31.475 align:middle line:84%
This is a middle-class woman in
an ordinary part of Minnesota.

00:17:31.475 --> 00:17:32.350 align:middle line:90%
She told her husband.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:84%
The husband said, you don't
know anything about cheetahs.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.670 align:middle line:90%
She said, but I can learn.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, she went to
Namibia with $10,000.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.960 align:middle line:84%
She poured her energies
out, and now, there

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.940 align:middle line:84%
are twice as many cheetahs as
there were when she turned up.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.550 align:middle line:84%
She would never have
imagined that she was going

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.840 align:middle line:90%
to do something like that.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.300 align:middle line:84%
She just followed the
voice of her heart.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.910 align:middle line:84%
She had the guts to do
it, and the universe

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.757 align:middle line:90%
organized her success.

00:17:58.757 --> 00:17:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:03.007 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: That will happen to
people if they trust enough.

00:18:03.007 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.762 align:middle line:84%
Now, do you mind if
I read a little poem?

00:18:05.762 --> 00:18:07.470 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of along
the line of what we're

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:90%
speaking of from your book.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Not in the slightest.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:09.420 align:middle line:90%
No, God.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This book.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:10%
It's like, "Turn Me to
Gold: 108 poems of Kabir,"

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.380 align:middle line:10%
and you've translated.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.190 align:middle line:10%
And you have wonderful
photographs from Brett Hurd.

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.037 align:middle line:84%
This is a book you
want to just sit with.

00:18:22.037 --> 00:18:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: This is your book now.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You gave it to me.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.950 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- oh, the
photography and Kabir.

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So this particular poem
says, "This whole world

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:34.980 align:middle line:90%
is a field of action.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.770 align:middle line:84%
You plow it to
raise a rich crop,

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:42.660 align:middle line:84%
but the wild deer of attachment
ruins the harvest, and most

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.260 align:middle line:84%
return empty-handed
to the barn."

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: I know.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
this because as you say,

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle line:84%
it's a field of
action which you plow.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Right.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But attachment.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.600 align:middle line:84%
So talk about what
this poem from Kabir

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.990 align:middle line:84%
means in context of what we
were just speaking about even.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Well, you
said it when you said,

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.380 align:middle line:90%
"We all chose to be here."

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: And I think
our fundamental choice

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:10.770 align:middle line:84%
to be in this time was for
the kind of total awakening

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:14.275 align:middle line:84%
that this time can give
because it's so ferocious.

00:19:14.275 --> 00:19:15.075 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:19:15.075 --> 00:19:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So attachment.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: If you come to this
time and don't realize that

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.970 align:middle line:84%
what it's asking you to
do is to rid yourself

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.640 align:middle line:84%
of your attachments, and
illusions, and plunge,

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.540 align:middle line:84%
into divine love, and offer
your whole life up to love

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.740 align:middle line:90%
and service--

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:31.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:33.783 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: You're missing
the point of having

00:19:33.783 --> 00:19:35.430 align:middle line:90%
chosen this incarnation.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:39.840 align:middle line:84%
So get with the evolutionary
program of the divine.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.580 align:middle line:90%
Accept its terms.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.930 align:middle line:90%
Do the work.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Turn up, and you will
go full to the barn.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.410 align:middle line:84%
You'll go with your arms
full of the golden wheat

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:56.640 align:middle line:84%
of your own sacred
actions and realizations.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.978 align:middle line:84%
And you'll return home joyful,
knowing who you really are.

00:19:59.978 --> 00:20:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you may have to
go through a heartbreak or two,

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.490 align:middle line:90%
and that's OK.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Everybody--

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where
the maturity comes from.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: The greatest
mystics have to die into life.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.340 align:middle line:90%
You have to die into life.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So don't be afraid--

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Don't be afraid.

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:12.622 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --of making mistakes.

00:20:12.622 --> 00:20:15.658 align:middle line:84%
Don't be afraid of potential
heartbreak in this process.

00:20:15.658 --> 00:20:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Well, listen to Rumi.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Can I quote--

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, please.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.878 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Quote to
Kabir, but these

00:20:19.878 --> 00:20:21.480 align:middle line:90%
are the two great kahunas.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.290 align:middle line:90%
These are the big--

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're the big guys.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: They're the big guys.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:10%
And Rumi says, "The
grapes of my body

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:37.080 align:middle line:10%
can only become wine after
the winemaker tramples me.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I surrender my body like
grapes to his trampling,

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:46.500 align:middle line:84%
so my inmost heart can
blaze and dance with joy.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And although the grapes go on
sobbing blood and screaming,

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I cannot bear anymore anguish,
I cannot bear anymore cruelty,

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:02.750 align:middle line:84%
the trampler stuffs cotton
in his ears and says,

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:08.600 align:middle line:84%
it is I who am the
master of this work.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.600 align:middle line:90%
You can deny me if you want.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.150 align:middle line:90%
You have every excuse.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:21.530 align:middle line:84%
But when, through my passion,
you reach perfection,

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:27.530 align:middle line:84%
you will never be done
praising my name."

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:31.280 align:middle line:84%
The whole story of
our time is in that.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The whole story.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: We need
to surrender, so

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.620 align:middle line:84%
that we can be taught
the deep meaning of what

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:37.730 align:middle line:90%
we're going through.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:38.967 align:middle line:90%
It won't be easy.

00:21:38.967 --> 00:21:40.925 align:middle line:84%
There will be moments
when we scream and shout.

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Our grapes
are going to be crushed.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.403 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: They're
going to be crushed,

00:21:43.403 --> 00:21:46.490 align:middle line:84%
but new wine is being
pressed from that crushing.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:47.948 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that
is so beautiful.

00:21:47.948 --> 00:21:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: And when we taste
it-- and I have tasted it

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.990 align:middle line:90%
in this life.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.740 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm not
exaggerating or lying.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:59.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to help people, at
this moment, die into life.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So that they can know what I
and so many others now know,

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:08.360 align:middle line:84%
which is that there is a new
life coming for the world.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:13.610 align:middle line:84%
A vast, amazing, utterly,
extraordinary, new kind

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.290 align:middle line:90%
of humanity being born.

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
through Hell to get there,

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:22.978 align:middle line:84%
but the doors are open to
that unbelievable possibility.

00:22:22.978 --> 00:22:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is so beautiful.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:25.650 align:middle line:90%
I could say, cut, we're done.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:27.240 align:middle line:84%
We're not even going to
finish this interview.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.073 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: It's true.

00:22:28.073 --> 00:22:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you for sharing
the poem from Rumi but also,

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.740 align:middle line:84%
for sharing your own extension
of that because you're right.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Everybody can feel
the correctness in it.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So it almost feels tedious to
go through the rest of the talk,

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:40.320 align:middle line:90%
but we're going to.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Oh, we'll
make it something.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, I want to go back
to something we talked about

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.030 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And that is in the classically
new age, which is dying.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:50.077 align:middle line:90%
That's dying.

00:22:50.077 --> 00:22:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Thank God.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:51.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank God.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.710 align:middle line:90%
There was--

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: I've done
everything I can to inter it.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, oh, boy you have.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you have.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:57.410 align:middle line:90%
To tear it down.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.040 align:middle line:84%
But there's a
denial as you've put

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.330 align:middle line:84%
it-- denial of harsher
realities using fake compassion

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:09.480 align:middle line:84%
and cheerfulness and too easily
giving forgiveness, which makes

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.800 align:middle line:90%
it hard to tell the truth.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Right.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
those statements.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: There's
a great difference

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:90%
between happiness and joy.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:19.910 align:middle line:90%
Happiness comes and goes.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Joy comes from deep
connection with the source.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that New Agers
have made a Devil's bargain

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.750 align:middle line:84%
because fundamentally,
they've wanted

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.730 align:middle line:90%
to be happy and cheerful.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And that has meant
for them excluding

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:38.940 align:middle line:84%
the horror, the pain, the agony
that is actually happening.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.330 align:middle line:84%
But in excluding the
horror and the pain

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:45.020 align:middle line:84%
and the agony, what they
haven't gone through

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.930 align:middle line:84%
is the kind of
process that breaks

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:51.440 align:middle line:84%
you open to radical
compassion and makes

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.670 align:middle line:84%
you far humbler and far
more truly initiated

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:58.263 align:middle line:84%
into the source,
which brings joy.

00:23:58.263 --> 00:24:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say,
it allows you access to joy.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: So you think
you're preaching joy

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.065 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know
what real joy is.

00:24:06.065 --> 00:24:08.023 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Joy is so much
deeper than happiness.

00:24:08.023 --> 00:24:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: It's so much deeper.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you really say as so
often in the new age you hear,

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:21.770 align:middle line:84%
"don't judge," you're
really being absurd.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:27.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't judge in the sense
of don't hate and don't ever

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.960 align:middle line:84%
exclude anybody from the
possibility of transformation.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:35.300 align:middle line:84%
But see clearly that some people
have chosen very dark things

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.025 align:middle line:84%
and are doing very, very
dark and dangerous action.

00:24:38.025 --> 00:24:39.567 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That needs
to be recognized

00:24:39.567 --> 00:24:39.680 align:middle line:90%
and acknowledged, yes.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: And that needs to be
recognized but without hatred.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.070 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to despise them.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.430 align:middle line:84%
But you do have to recognize
what they're up to.

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they can potentially
destroy, at this moment,

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:90%
the whole human enterprise.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.365 align:middle line:90%
Let's get real.

00:24:53.365 --> 00:24:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have a lot of
sociopaths, psychopaths,

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:59.060 align:middle line:84%
narcissists, and authoritarian
figures on the world

00:24:59.060 --> 00:24:59.920 align:middle line:90%
stage right now.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.170 align:middle line:90%
And we need to be aware of it.

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:02.040 align:middle line:90%
This is global.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: It's global.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's
a global phenomenon.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a cosmic phenomena.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: But it's also part
of what this crisis is about.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:14.500 align:middle line:84%
The Mother is saying
to us, don't be stupid.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.320 align:middle line:90%
Don't be blind.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:21.970 align:middle line:84%
See that some people, out
of vanity and delusion,

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.980 align:middle line:90%
have chosen the dark.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.260 align:middle line:90%
Realize the dark is powerful.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And realize that
through their choices,

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:32.500 align:middle line:84%
they are now threatening
the future of humanity.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.970 align:middle line:90%
Don't hate them.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.260 align:middle line:90%
They are my children.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.570 align:middle line:84%
They are your
brothers and sisters,

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:42.160 align:middle line:84%
but be very clear about
your responsibility.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And your responsibility
is to choose truth.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Choose justice.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Turn up as humble
sacred activists,

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and do everything in
your power to prevent

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.720 align:middle line:90%
them destroying everything.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: And if you turn up
like that, I will help you.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And you will see
that together, we

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:10.540 align:middle line:84%
can build a much more
harmonious and just world.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And help these people
who have chosen the dark.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Overcome their crazy appetites
and become humble, loving

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:21.338 align:middle line:90%
communers with me.

00:26:21.338 --> 00:26:22.630 align:middle line:90%
That's what she's saying to us.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, speaking of
the feminine, OK?

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yeah.

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:27.895 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Great Mother.

00:26:27.895 --> 00:26:29.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to-- we'll
talk about something

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:32.320 align:middle line:84%
that's I found
interesting in the moment.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.440 align:middle line:84%
This man, Andrea
Villa, a man who

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.960 align:middle line:84%
works with other men in
raising consciousness

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.850 align:middle line:84%
said to me-- whenever
I would see him,

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:41.110 align:middle line:90%
I'd say, how are you doing?

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Are you happy these days?

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And one day, he said, stop
asking me-- he's Italian.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Stop asking me if I'm happy.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Men aren't happy.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:55.090 align:middle line:84%
We experience a lot of things,
but happiness is the thing

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.500 align:middle line:90%
that women wish to experience.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.260 align:middle line:84%
That's not what men
are looking for.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Oh.

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
looking for meaning.

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:05.050 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
substance or joy.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.970 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
passion and so forth.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:11.000 align:middle line:84%
But happiness was relegated
to a different category,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.990 align:middle line:84%
in his mind, that only
women participate in.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: How crazy.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.620 align:middle line:84%
I think he has a
ghost of the truth.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:84%
I think what men are really
looking for is a quest.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Something that they can pull
their whole being into that's

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.470 align:middle line:90%
noble.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is really
going to help.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what the
deepest and richest men

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:33.310 align:middle line:90%
want more than anything.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.102 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
that was at the basis

00:27:35.102 --> 00:27:36.850 align:middle line:90%
of his teaching with other men.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And he was quite interesting,
but that was just sort

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.880 align:middle line:90%
of a shocking statement to me.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.060 align:middle line:84%
You say we're not looking
for happiness per se,

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.430 align:middle line:84%
but they were looking for
these other, as you say,

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:51.010 align:middle line:84%
to this fulfillment
in life that can

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.800 align:middle line:84%
feel as though it's beyond
our grasp and create despair.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Right.

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Women.

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:57.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a little different with us.

00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:02.250 align:middle line:84%
We have, a different
sensibility when

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:03.375 align:middle line:90%
it comes to the collective.

00:28:03.375 --> 00:28:04.175 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Right.

00:28:04.175 --> 00:28:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're more
wired perhaps to nature

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.400 align:middle line:84%
in the collective
on certain levels.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:14.140 align:middle line:84%
But this need for
harmony, peace--

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.560 align:middle line:84%
we call it happiness
amongst our tribe--

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.510 align:middle line:84%
our household, our
friendships, and so

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:22.750 align:middle line:84%
forth is of tantamount
importance to women.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.090 align:middle line:84%
We don't distinguish
between happiness and joy

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:27.670 align:middle line:84%
per se, even though in
your speaking of it,

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:30.892 align:middle line:84%
you can feel the difference,
but we need both.

00:28:30.892 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: We need both.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of the great
characteristics

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.490 align:middle line:84%
of our time-- and I'm
sure you know this and see

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:40.000 align:middle line:84%
this-- is how many utterly,
amazing women are rising up

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:40.800 align:middle line:90%
as leaders.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Especially
African American women.

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:44.822 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: At this moment.

00:28:44.822 --> 00:28:48.825 align:middle line:84%
Just saying, we are here
to guide us through.

00:28:48.825 --> 00:28:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So there's a way in which
you could bring those two

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:53.325 align:middle line:84%
statements together, and it
might be something like this.

00:28:53.325 --> 00:28:58.330 align:middle line:84%
It's that men need to realize
that the goals that they set

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:01.660 align:middle line:84%
themselves, the noble goals,
should be in protection

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.410 align:middle line:90%
of life and cherishing of life.

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: And women
are the ones they need

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.490 align:middle line:90%
to learn that cherishing from.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:13.150 align:middle line:84%
The divine feminine will
teach them the truths of life,

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and then their goals
won't be destructive.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.565 align:middle line:90%
They'll just be further in the--

00:29:17.565 --> 00:29:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
service of life.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: --growth of life.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:20.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:22.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's another
area you talk about.

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:26.900 align:middle line:84%
"To go through
this, we have to--

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and I thought it was a
very interesting phrase--

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:33.470 align:middle line:84%
negotiate extremely,
stressful ambiguity--"

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Oh, yes.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:35.437 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "--all all times."

00:29:35.437 --> 00:29:37.660 align:middle line:84%
I chose things that to
me, I thought I really

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.460 align:middle line:90%
want to hear your explanation.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:43.660 align:middle line:84%
"While remaining in a
radical state of unknowing."

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yes.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So explain this to us.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.623 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to get very far,
and I've got so many questions.

00:29:49.623 --> 00:29:51.040 align:middle line:84%
But this is--
you're so wonderful.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.748 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: You've chosen
wonderful things.

00:29:52.748 --> 00:29:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So tell us about that.

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.450 align:middle line:84%
"To negotiate extremely,
stressful ambiguity while

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:01.600 align:middle line:84%
remaining in a state
of radical unknowing."

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And why this is so uncomfortable
for people to not know.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: We've been
brought up in a culture that

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:15.350 align:middle line:84%
is a fix-it culture that demands
solutions and clarities as it

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:18.060 align:middle line:90%
demands waffles.

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:22.020 align:middle line:84%
That has had a tremendous effect
and given us a lot of power.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.170 align:middle line:84%
But it has made us, in some
ways, profoundly spiritually

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:32.430 align:middle line:84%
stupid because the divine
is beyond any concept

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:35.100 align:middle line:84%
and any dogma that
we could ever create.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And the only way in
which you're going

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:40.560 align:middle line:84%
to be endlessly
expanded in wisdom

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:45.590 align:middle line:84%
is by understanding
that you don't know.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And resting in what the mystics
call "unknowing knowing."

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:54.500 align:middle line:90%
Being at home with not knowing.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that if you can stay
in that humble position,

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.340 align:middle line:84%
you'll be given what you
need to know to go forward.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you'll
know how to respond.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:03.877 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: And you'll
know how to respond

00:31:03.877 --> 00:31:07.290 align:middle line:84%
because instead of bringing
to the moment or the problem,

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:10.040 align:middle line:84%
all of your assumptions, all
of your passionate desire

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.140 align:middle line:84%
to have everything
cleaned up immediately--

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:17.060 align:middle line:84%
you'll be bringing the fullness
of your humble, clear presence.

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And in that humility
and in that clarity,

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:23.210 align:middle line:84%
you'll be given, by the divine,
these solutions, which you

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:25.820 align:middle line:90%
could not have imagined before.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.590 align:middle line:90%
That's been my experience.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:29.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the experience
of all mystics.

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:32.750 align:middle line:84%
But it's the key to how
to get through this period

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:37.040 align:middle line:84%
because one of the things this
dark night is revealing to us

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:41.390 align:middle line:84%
is that any solutions that we
make out of the consciousness

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:84%
that we're in at
the moment, however

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.830 align:middle line:84%
noble and intelligent
it may be, are not

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:49.370 align:middle line:84%
going to work because
that consciousness is

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:53.440 align:middle line:90%
what's going to be transformed.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.540 align:middle line:84%
So, knowing that-- and
that's very tough to accept.

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.600 align:middle line:84%
If you just surrender,
as the poem by Rumi

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.310 align:middle line:90%
suggests-- it's essential.

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Surrender in unknowing trust.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:09.150 align:middle line:84%
You'll find that you'll
be given the equilibrium

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:13.200 align:middle line:84%
and the spaciousness to
see things as they are

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and to respond from your
own innate divine wisdom

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:21.390 align:middle line:84%
in ways that will shock
you by their effectiveness.

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:23.760 align:middle line:84%
But everybody has to
discover that for themselves.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.530 align:middle line:84%
But when they do,
it's so thrilling.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:28.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:30.060 align:middle line:84%
So the antithesis
of that right now.

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.402 align:middle line:84%
You're bringing up all these
beautiful things about humanity

00:32:33.402 --> 00:32:34.360 align:middle line:90%
and where we're headed.

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm kind of tossing
in the challenges we face.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Oh, God.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, as you know, I've written
a lot about those challenges.

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, you have.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Being in this humble state
of not knowing and accepting

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:50.130 align:middle line:84%
the ambiguity until the answers
come, the opposite of that

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:54.990 align:middle line:84%
is an explosion of
mental-emotional disorders

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:56.280 align:middle line:90%
such as narcissism.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yes.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How and why?

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Why is that becoming--

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Well, because
people are in a--

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --so center stage.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:04.235 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: --dreadful panic.

00:33:04.235 --> 00:33:08.690 align:middle line:84%
They are desperate at all this
destruction and dissolution.

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't find
the mystical guidance that

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:17.180 align:middle line:84%
is being offered, they
are going to retreat

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.840 align:middle line:84%
into authoritarianism, into
fantasy, into delusion,

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.187 align:middle line:90%
into narcissism into denial.

00:33:23.187 --> 00:33:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lack of empathy.

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:24.717 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Lack of empathy.

00:33:24.717 --> 00:33:25.925 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lack of compassion.

00:33:25.925 --> 00:33:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: That's
why I'm working.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why all of
us, who are trying

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.150 align:middle line:84%
to be midwives of the new
world are working overtime

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.370 align:middle line:84%
at this moment to try
and help people get

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.890 align:middle line:90%
to the much richer realities.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they'll be threatened
by these solutions, which

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:42.110 align:middle line:84%
will only make
extinction more likely

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:43.740 align:middle line:90%
and not help us at this moment.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:49.335 align:middle line:84%
So let's go through
the four R's, OK?

00:33:49.335 --> 00:33:51.710 align:middle line:84%
We'll go into them because
this is the helpful part here.

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: This is the real part.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Reconnection.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: We need to
reconnect with our source.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.500 align:middle line:84%
We need to reconnect
with nature.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.110 align:middle line:84%
We need to reconnect
with each other

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.900 align:middle line:84%
as sacred friends and
sacred companions.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.950 align:middle line:84%
We need to reconnect
with animals.

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: If we do this
rich work of reconnection--

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Trees.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: --we will become
much wider and more spacious

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and have-- find that we
have far, far more strength

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.040 align:middle line:84%
available to us because the
whole universe is trying

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.889 align:middle line:90%
to help us at this moment.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:26.650 align:middle line:84%
The divine knows exactly
what we've created out

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:30.429 align:middle line:84%
of our madness but is
offering us simple ways

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:34.750 align:middle line:84%
to really, really get
down with what can truly

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.150 align:middle line:90%
inspire and strengthen us.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:39.116 align:middle line:84%
And reconnection
is the beginning.

00:34:39.116 --> 00:34:41.199 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mentioned
nature, and something just

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:42.219 align:middle line:90%
popped into my mind.

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Seems tangential
but maybe not as we

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.370 align:middle line:84%
know from the existence
of homeopathy.

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yes.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that the waters of
this planet are, by the moment,

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.300 align:middle line:90%
taking in cosmic information.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yes.

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't stop
and think about the waters

00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:02.030 align:middle line:84%
as being an embodiment of
this cosmic knowledge at all.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:06.257 align:middle line:84%
We just put some chlorine in it,
purify it, and turn on the tap.

00:35:06.257 --> 00:35:08.715 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: We have a totally
objectivist view of everything,

00:35:08.715 --> 00:35:10.030 align:middle line:90%
and it's tragic.

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can't help but
think that exposing ourselves

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:16.780 align:middle line:84%
to the natural bodies
of water on the planet

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:20.230 align:middle line:84%
can't help but be incredibly
fulfilling and uplifting

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:23.590 align:middle line:84%
on an auric level, a physical
level, and spiritual level.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: But nature
on every level.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: If you do reconnect
with adoration with nature--

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Rumi said something
so wonderful.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:35.280 align:middle line:84%
He said, adore the
beloved, and the beloved

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:39.240 align:middle line:84%
will reveal to you that
each thing that exists

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:45.600 align:middle line:84%
is one drop from the beloved's
river of infinite beauty.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So if you reconnect
with a tree or an animal

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:53.100 align:middle line:84%
or a plant with that
degree of tender,

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:57.030 align:middle line:84%
humble, unknowing
adoration, you already

00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:01.110 align:middle line:84%
are coming into connection with
the cosmic force of creativity.

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: It enhances
your whole being.

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, we
go to resistance.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Resistance.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:12.930 align:middle line:84%
We need to resist
the tendencies in us

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:18.660 align:middle line:84%
for limited, separate
thought and action.

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.450 align:middle line:84%
We need to resist the
sides of ourselves that

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.790 align:middle line:84%
don't care, that
want to be paralyzed,

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.500 align:middle line:84%
that don't want to
face what's happening.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That want
to make enemies.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.542 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Don't want
to make enemies.

00:36:28.542 --> 00:36:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Don't want to stand up
for the truth and justice.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.310 align:middle line:90%
And that takes courage.

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:36.300 align:middle line:84%
But reconnection will give
you the courage to resist.

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And we need to stand
up when necessary

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:43.500 align:middle line:84%
against those who are trying
to destroy the experiment.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Resilience.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Resilience comes from
reconnection and resistance,

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:54.360 align:middle line:84%
because when you reconnect
deeply with the source

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and realize that
you are being asked

00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:00.840 align:middle line:84%
to resist your own dark impulses
and to stand up for justice

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.660 align:middle line:84%
in the world, you
discover that you're

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.690 align:middle line:84%
so much stronger than you
ever imagined you could be.

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And you discover also that
there are others there,

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.510 align:middle line:84%
who will help you,
and who will join you,

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and who will dance with
you, and who will love you,

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.470 align:middle line:90%
and who will encourage you.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And through that discovery,
you become resilient.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:25.350 align:middle line:84%
You become able
to dance with life

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:28.350 align:middle line:84%
instead of trying to impose
your own pattern upon life.

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And you discover that
you are able to weather

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:36.750 align:middle line:84%
much more grief, and difficulty,
and heartbreak, and pain

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:38.900 align:middle line:90%
than you ever knew you were.

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And with
more grace and harmony.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And you bring up in
the book because you

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.520 align:middle line:84%
were raised in India the
first nine years of your life.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's a special
place in your heart.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about
how there where people

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:51.480 align:middle line:90%
are living with almost nothing.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.890 align:middle line:84%
How easily they share
and joyfully they share.

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: The Indian
poor are my teachers.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.608 align:middle line:84%
They are the most resilient
people in the world.

00:38:00.608 --> 00:38:01.650 align:middle line:90%
They are the most joyful.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --resourceful.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Creative.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yes.

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.377 align:middle line:84%
And that resilience--
you're right.

00:38:05.377 --> 00:38:06.960 align:middle line:84%
How wonderful that
you brought that up

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.290 align:middle line:84%
because one of the things
that makes the Indian poor so

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:13.650 align:middle line:84%
resilient is their true
compassion for each other

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:16.290 align:middle line:84%
and their willingness
to do everything

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:17.970 align:middle line:90%
they can to help each other.

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:20.610 align:middle line:84%
I have a great friend
who's a rickshaw driver.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:23.190 align:middle line:90%
He makes perhaps $2 a day.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I help his family, but I
have been so overwhelmed

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.890 align:middle line:90%
by the love they all share.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:32.070 align:middle line:84%
They are all there
for each other

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:35.070 align:middle line:90%
every moment of every day.

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And they are resilient as have--
they really are extraordinary.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:40.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I--

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: And that's
the place where

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:43.440 align:middle line:90%
we're going to go to, too.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so beautiful.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: It is beautiful,
but it's more than beautiful.

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:48.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the key to how
the human race can

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.697 align:middle line:90%
survive this terrible passage.

00:38:50.697 --> 00:38:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Being there
for one another truly.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:53.447 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Being there.

00:38:53.447 --> 00:38:55.627 align:middle line:90%
And cultivating and encouraging.

00:38:55.627 --> 00:38:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --service.

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Exactly.

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:58.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we come
to regeneration.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.980 align:middle line:90%
And here, I have the question.

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Who do I want to be in
this difficult time?

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: With regeneration,
in the way that I've

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.530 align:middle line:84%
been exploring it in this
book, "Radical Regeneration,"

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:15.700 align:middle line:84%
has many, many
different meanings.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:20.950 align:middle line:84%
The deepest meaning is the
goal for this huge, dark night.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:25.240 align:middle line:84%
The goal is the birth of an
embodied divine humanity.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the second
coming, which is not

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:29.140 align:middle line:84%
going to be the
return of some avatar

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:32.950 align:middle line:84%
but the rising of the golden
yeast of love consciousness

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:34.450 align:middle line:90%
and millions of beings.

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And this transformation we
know from the great mystics

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:41.650 align:middle line:84%
is not just a transformation of
consciousness or of the heart.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:45.320 align:middle line:84%
It's also going to be a
transformation of the body.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: So, as we
cultivate reconnection,

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:53.530 align:middle line:84%
as we cultivate resistance,
as we experience resilience,

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:58.000 align:middle line:84%
we are entering this
evolutionary mystery

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.700 align:middle line:84%
in which we're going
to be transformed

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.950 align:middle line:90%
in mind, heart, soul, and body.

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And with the powers
that come in the course

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.920 align:middle line:90%
of that amazing transformation--

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Truly,
longer life span--

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:10.315 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: We'll be regenerated.

00:40:10.315 --> 00:40:12.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Increased
strength and vitality.

00:40:12.065 --> 00:40:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Exactly.

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:15.880 align:middle line:84%
But the powers that we have
of intelligence and passion

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.780 align:middle line:90%
and truth--

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.070 align:middle line:90%
they will help us.

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Not only regenerate ourselves
but regenerate our whole way

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:24.697 align:middle line:90%
of being and doing everything.

00:40:24.697 --> 00:40:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, everything.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Everything.

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I want to get to
this before we sign off today.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's that the
Western world has lost

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:37.280 align:middle line:90%
sight of the wisdom of elders.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yes.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say
this is at our own peril?

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yes.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this has
to be reestablished?

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yes.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we don't
want the old way,

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and we don't want
charlatans, and we

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:48.400 align:middle line:90%
don't want things by rote.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So talk about it
in a complex form

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:55.800 align:middle line:84%
of finding the elders that
have the wisdom we need now.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Elders aren't
just older people.

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:00.227 align:middle line:84%
There are some elders I
know who are in their 20s.

00:41:00.227 --> 00:41:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: And it's
really respecting wisdom,

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and respecting, and
listening for people

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:10.590 align:middle line:84%
who will tell us the truth in
an encouraging and loving way.

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:16.350 align:middle line:84%
They are the elders whether
they're 22 or 35 or 85.

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:19.860 align:middle line:84%
There's three things that
characterize a real elder.

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:24.750 align:middle line:84%
The first is that the real
elder will not flatter you

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:28.920 align:middle line:84%
because the real elder knows
that if they flatter you,

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.570 align:middle line:90%
they are endangering you.

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:35.170 align:middle line:84%
They will tell you the truth
in a simple, clear way.

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:38.220 align:middle line:84%
The second thing that
a real elder will do

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:42.570 align:middle line:84%
is to radiate love, compassion,
and encouragement because they

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:46.290 align:middle line:84%
know from their own experience
that however tough things are,

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:50.730 align:middle line:84%
if you rise to the challenge
humbly and receptive to grace,

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:53.430 align:middle line:84%
you will be fed
strengths that you need.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing that
the elder will be and do

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.550 align:middle line:90%
is to be there for you.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:04.230 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, you don't have
to do this on your own.

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:07.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm here, and we're all
here in this together,

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:10.260 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to do it together.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.580 align:middle line:90%
Those three things.

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And those can be in any age, but
those are the three qualities

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:19.260 align:middle line:84%
that we really now
need in our leaders,

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:20.900 align:middle line:90%
in our guides, everything.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:24.520 align:middle line:84%
But there's some amazing
elders on the planet.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.680 align:middle line:90%
Think of Jane Goodall.

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Think
of the Dalai Lama.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.295 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:42:28.295 --> 00:42:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Here they are.

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:33.780 align:middle line:84%
We must get with them
because they have everything

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.720 align:middle line:90%
to offer us at this moment.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I'm trying to
be at this moment of my life.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you are.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: A joyful elder.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and also, my
final point here that you make,

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:45.348 align:middle line:84%
and that is to be
a sacred warrior.

00:42:45.348 --> 00:42:46.148 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yes.

00:42:46.148 --> 00:42:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And midwife.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yes.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: During this process.

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Both.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Both?

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yes.

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:52.777 align:middle line:90%
So you are that?

00:42:52.777 --> 00:42:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Well, I hope so.

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.568 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let's
talk about the nature

00:42:55.568 --> 00:42:58.990 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual warrior
before we say goodbye.

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: Well, I say,
be a midwife warrior.

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And that means for
me bring together

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:12.080 align:middle line:84%
in yourself the deepest
compassion with the greatest

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.270 align:middle line:90%
possible courage.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:18.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's not being just a
midwife or just a warrior.

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:22.670 align:middle line:84%
It's being a midwife,
who is birthing the new

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and standing up for it,
and being a warrior that

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.060 align:middle line:84%
is attuned to the
sacred feminine,

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.155 align:middle line:84%
to life at the deepest
level, protecting--

00:43:31.155 --> 00:43:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And to be--

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Life.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --of service to that.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: To be of
service to that.

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:41.660 align:middle line:84%
So, I believe that the new
humanity will be in the deepest

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.160 align:middle line:90%
sense, androgynous.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.750 align:middle line:84%
It will be neither
male nor female.

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.450 align:middle line:84%
We'll go beyond
those categories.

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And each being will fuse,
in their own unique way,

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:56.420 align:middle line:84%
the deepest sacred feminine
with the wisest and kindest,

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.500 align:middle line:90%
sacred masculine.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:57.745 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well
that's when we reach

00:43:57.745 --> 00:43:59.820 align:middle line:84%
that ultimate enlightenment
as the human species.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Right.

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Certainly.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: But that's the goal.

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:05.735 align:middle line:84%
And we can start working
towards that goal right now.

00:44:05.735 --> 00:44:07.110 align:middle line:10%
Anybody listening
can start that.

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it means
letting go the patriarchy.

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.870 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Bye bye.

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:10.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, the patriarchy is--

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gone.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Obviously.

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's got to go.

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: It's going to cling
to its power, but it's over.

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my God.

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW: In the heart-mind
of God, it is finished.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.313 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right now.

00:44:18.313 --> 00:44:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And the final thing you
say I love, which is,

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.710 align:middle line:84%
act in a noble way
as best you can

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:27.560 align:middle line:90%
because nobility is contagious.

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Yes.

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that.

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:31.400 align:middle line:90%
Andrew, I love you.

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:36.230 align:middle line:84%
I love your wisdom and
your oratory abilities

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:39.030 align:middle line:84%
to be able to convey things
in a way that we can hear.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Just beautiful.

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:42.990 align:middle line:10%
And not only that, you just
become richer and wiser

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:43.790 align:middle line:10%
with the years.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:44.623 align:middle line:10%
>>ANDREW: Thank you.

00:44:44.623 --> 00:44:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --more
beautiful with the years.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.357 align:middle line:90%
So I just want to be--

00:44:47.357 --> 00:44:48.357 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Polished.

00:44:48.357 --> 00:44:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Thank you.

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:52.130 align:middle line:84%

for having written this
book and continuing

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:57.297 align:middle line:84%
to be that sacred
warrior and midwife.

00:44:57.297 --> 00:44:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREW: Thank you.

00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And because
you're showing

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:00.660 align:middle line:90%
the way for the rest of us.

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.570 align:middle line:90%
