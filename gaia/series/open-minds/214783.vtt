>> REGINA MEREDITH: This is
going to be a pretty deep talk

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.320 align:middle line:10%
about how our soul development
may be affected by AI.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.900 align:middle line:10%
It's a complex topic
worth pondering

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.870 align:middle line:10%
as we're all choosing how we're
willing to engage with AI.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Mystic and teacher,
Steven Ross, is with us

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.690 align:middle line:84%
here after giving the subject
a great amount of thought.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.793 align:middle line:10%
Steven, welcome back.

00:00:37.793 --> 00:00:38.960 align:middle line:90%
It's always good to see you.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.043 align:middle line:90%
>> STEVEN ROSS: Thank you.

00:00:40.043 --> 00:00:42.120 align:middle line:90%
Regina Thank you very much.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Everybody just loves
your spirit, as do I. And oh,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.540 align:middle line:84%
that's to say nothing
of your intellect.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's start talking
about it from the notion

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:84%
that you really can't go
anywhere anymore without it

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.920 align:middle line:90%
being thrown in your face.

Either, come on,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.030 align:middle line:10%
to engage with I and I was
talking to someone recently

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.340 align:middle line:10%
who was saying, oh, I'm
just having so much fun

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.370 align:middle line:10%
writing my new books.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm just using AI.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.220 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, no.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.260 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about
your experience

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.230 align:middle line:10%
and what you're seeing
about this proliferation.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:84%
It almost seems like
it's happened overnight.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.440 align:middle line:84%
It's taken a long
time to get here,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.650 align:middle line:84%
but it reached a
critical mass where

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:90%
everyone started popping it up.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: I couldn't
agree with you more.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:10%
And I want to start our
conversation with sharing

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:39.830 align:middle line:10%
my iPhone has 43,000 PDFs,
not attached to the cloud.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.570 align:middle line:10%
I do not need Wi-Fi.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:10%
It is physically sitting
on my 1 terabyte iPhone.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.480 align:middle line:10%
So I love the idea
of organization.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And as a librarian, I am
carrying virtually an entire

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:90%
library going back to the 1400s.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And as we go into
restaurants and we look,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.720 align:middle line:90%
everybody's on their iPhone.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed they're not
talking as much with each other.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.039 align:middle line:84%
So let's really begin
our conversation there,

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.610 align:middle line:84%
that it is a big
aspect of our lives.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:84%
It's accelerating
into what it can do

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and how people are
tending to use it.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:84%
But our question that I'd
like to delve in with you

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:84%
is, is it really helping us
develop our spirit inside?

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.103 align:middle line:84%
And does it have the possibility
of even helping our spirits?

00:02:41.103 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
a good question,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and that's where we're
going to go with it.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.230 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we have
to wade through what

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.060 align:middle line:84%
is becoming a plethora of fake
images and fake storylines.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.820 align:middle line:10%
And these kids
that are growing up

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:10%
with all the devices
available to them, really

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.850 align:middle line:10%
from the time they can handle
a device, 2 years old up.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're pretty
skilled by 6, 7, 8 years old.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, what does this
do on a level of one's ability

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.710 align:middle line:84%
to discern truth when you're
exposed to lie after lie,

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.140 align:middle line:84%
fake image after fake image
from the time you can talk?

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: It's going to be a
great difficulty, I think,

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:90%
in spiritual evolvement.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Again, for the very thing you
just stated, what is truth

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:90%
and what is reality?

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
from a fundamental,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.830 align:middle line:84%
our reality is dependent
on how we think

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.720 align:middle line:84%
and what our mind
presents to us.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.260 align:middle line:10%
And just looking at some
Facebook posts yesterday,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.530 align:middle line:10%
I'm laughing because
they're showing

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.080 align:middle line:10%
figures that were discovered
in the ground that

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.940 align:middle line:10%
are 15 feet high,
humans, UFOs that

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.530 align:middle line:10%
are just under the mountain,
under the rubble that

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.990 align:middle line:10%
are obvious--

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.930 align:middle line:10%
untrue.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:10%
They're just not real.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.150 align:middle line:10%
Now, I'm not saying they
may not have existed,

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.420 align:middle line:10%
but the way the photographs
are going right now,

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.950 align:middle line:10%
this AI is just
accelerating people

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.959 align:middle line:10%
putting false information.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And again, our mind
determines our reality.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.730 align:middle line:10%
And if our mind is inundated
with images and false images,

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.120 align:middle line:10%
it is coloring what
our beliefs are

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.980 align:middle line:10%
and what we think
we're capable of.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.810 align:middle line:10%
And I just feel that
the majority of the AI

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.590 align:middle line:10%
now is allowing individuals
to create images,

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.580 align:middle line:10%
and they really don't have
an understanding of how they

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:10%
are affecting other people.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.940 align:middle line:10%
They think it's fun,
they think it's clever.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.180 align:middle line:90%
You have beautiful images--

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.513 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They look like fakes.

00:04:58.513 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: That's right, but
your statement is correct.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.400 align:middle line:84%
It is altering our
reality and taking us,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.270 align:middle line:84%
to me, outside where in
all the shows we've done,

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.100 align:middle line:84%
where I'm looking to point
people to know thyself,

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.400 align:middle line:90%
it is taking us more outside.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And there are a couple of
things I want to jump on here.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.140 align:middle line:84%
For one, the proponents of
AI and the creators of AI

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:84%
say, hey, this helps
develop human creativity.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.060 align:middle line:10%
It helps humans develop
their creativity.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And I go back to what my
friend said, is like, oh, I so

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.950 align:middle line:84%
resisted starting to write my
book until I could jump on AI.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.330 align:middle line:90%
And now it's just so fun.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.830 align:middle line:84%
It just kind of,
it's all flowing.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:10%
I give it some ideas
of how I want it to go,

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.390 align:middle line:10%
and I'm listening.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of
people are doing this.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you're putting
a resume together

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and you're having to just
drudge all this stuff up and try

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.840 align:middle line:84%
to make sense of it
and make it coherent,

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.900 align:middle line:84%
I can understand the time-saving
effects of that kind of thing.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But what about
writing a book on spiritual

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:84%
principles and letting AI do
a lot of the heavy lifting?

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.820 align:middle line:10%
I just don't know what
to think about this.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:10%
I was kind of
shocked, initially.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.370 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: And as you and I were
discussing putting this show

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:10%
together and talking
about this topic,

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.560 align:middle line:10%
I've really done a lot of
deep thinking about this.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.190 align:middle line:90%
And I look at it like this.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.970 align:middle line:84%
When you just have words that
are expressed but there's

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.290 align:middle line:90%
no emotion or spiritual--

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Feeling.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: --energy and feeling
behind it, they're just words.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:10%
And this is the
difference that I'm

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.710 align:middle line:10%
designating the computer
generated IA, words

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:52.200 align:middle line:10%
and information versus a human
being with spiritual energy,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.220 align:middle line:10%
with love, compassion,
all of these aspects,

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.160 align:middle line:10%
there is a frequency,
there is a vibration

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.930 align:middle line:10%
that makes us human like that.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.520 align:middle line:10%
And having words, even though
you may look at these words

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.570 align:middle line:10%
and, yes, they make good
sense and something's

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.660 align:middle line:10%
being visualized, it
does not have the power.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:10%
It would be the same as the
speaker, in my opinion, who

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.320 align:middle line:10%
is lecturing, looking
down, looking at notes,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:10%
doesn't look at the people,
they're just words emanating.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.810 align:middle line:10%
But when somebody is out like
we are and you express something

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:38.060 align:middle line:10%
with an energy behind it,
it touches the end user,

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.480 align:middle line:10%
the receiving
person, the audience.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:48.640 align:middle line:10%
And so I do not see that
in these generated texts

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.860 align:middle line:10%
when somebody is
going, no, I created--

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.730 align:middle line:10%
no, you did not create it.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.060 align:middle line:10%
Your machine created it.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.470 align:middle line:10%
It put it together very
nicely, but it does not

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:05.830 align:middle line:10%
have the beautiful energy that
we transmit human to human.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I totally
agree with that.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, if one is
writing their book and even if,

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.595 align:middle line:84%
say, you have editors that
go through and clean up

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:17.470 align:middle line:84%
grammar and punctuation
and all that, anyway,

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.387 align:middle line:90%
when you write a book.

00:08:18.387 --> 00:08:20.490 align:middle line:10%
So short of that, if there
are words that may not

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:10%
have been the most
perfect selection,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:10%
but they represent how you think
and how you feel, that book,

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:10%
are you saying then,
is imbued forever

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:10%
with what you were infusing
it with in that moment?

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And then it carries
on print after print.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Our energy carries on,
and that same imprint

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.030 align:middle line:84%
can't happen where there
is no feeling about it.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: I'm recalling an
excerpt in the Bible where

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.380 align:middle line:84%
the disciples went out and could
not cure an individual and came

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.173 align:middle line:84%
back to Jesus and said,
gee, we said the words but--

00:08:56.173 --> 00:08:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Nothing happened.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.798 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: --we not have the
healing, yeah, nothing happened.

00:08:59.798 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that's
a very good example

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:84%
of not understanding
the energy, the feeling

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:90%
behind the expression.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.230 align:middle line:10%
I'm tending to think,
even though I started

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:15.620 align:middle line:10%
with how much my iPhone
holds, on the other side,

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:20.740 align:middle line:10%
I think too much is being
taken away from individual's

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.340 align:middle line:10%
understanding.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.970 align:middle line:84%
When you create something
within yourself,

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:31.310 align:middle line:84%
you are tapping into
deep soul resources

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.430 align:middle line:90%
that is why we're here.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm going to
go a little off-script

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:42.290 align:middle line:84%
because an important aspect
here is, why are we here?

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.880 align:middle line:84%
What do people in
your audience believe

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.812 align:middle line:84%
is the reason we
are down on Earth

00:09:48.812 --> 00:09:50.270 align:middle line:84%
having these
different experiences.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.187 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, we're
going to get into that.

00:09:52.187 --> 00:09:53.950 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole chunk
of our conversation.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:55.210 align:middle line:90%
So to be revealed.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: OK.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're going to
go a little linear here.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.630 align:middle line:84%
I want to get back to
this creativity thing.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Yes, you got to
keep me on this tight--

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, I do.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, hey, I do.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.273 align:middle line:90%
I put you back on your tracks.

00:10:05.273 --> 00:10:06.190 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: There you go.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the notion that
it's actually expanding human

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.130 align:middle line:90%
creativity--

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --how do
you feel about that?

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: I did meet an
individual who told me that

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:20.440 align:middle line:84%
he's using a program, and as he
creates, it makes him think, OK,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to alter
this, push it into AI,

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to give
me a different picture.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:31.750 align:middle line:10%
So we can say, yes, there is
some change that's taken place.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.440 align:middle line:10%
The individual is
moving forward.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.790 align:middle line:84%
But again, I'm looking
at the deeper aspects

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.660 align:middle line:90%
of who we are as people.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:45.360 align:middle line:10%
We are not developing
that within ourselves

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:52.280 align:middle line:10%
from that great well, that
incredible deep aspect

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.710 align:middle line:10%
of who we are in this
soul spiritual self.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And that creativity
from that aspect

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:84%
is what allows us to grow and
expand in our consciousness

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.550 align:middle line:90%
and awareness.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.420 align:middle line:84%
So does the AI
help in creativity?

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but does it help in
the spiritual creativity?

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.030 align:middle line:84%
That is where I'm
designating this fine line.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.900 align:middle line:90%
To me, it does not.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:27.530 align:middle line:84%
It is not coming from an area
that I believe is important

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.875 align:middle line:90%
for our, quote, "soul's growth."

00:11:30.875 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so then you have
the whole notion of information

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.090 align:middle line:84%
where people are taking
on information-- well,

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:84%
first of all, our brains really
haven't developed fast enough

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:84%
to be able to keep up with what
computers can do and what AI can

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:42.660 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we just haven't in
terms of stuffing information

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.080 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a rare person.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.380 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: However,
there are savants.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.838 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: There
are savants, yeah.

00:11:50.838 --> 00:11:52.220 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: --who can calculate--

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:52.850 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: That's correct.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:53.850 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: --unbelievable.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.760 align:middle line:10%
So here's the question.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Do we all have that
capability somewhere within us

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.313 align:middle line:84%
that could be just as fast as
some of these computers are?

00:12:04.313 --> 00:12:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I would think so.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.025 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Well--

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: If some can,
that means it's possible.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: That's why I keep
returning because you do believe

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.280 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So yes,
but right now,

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.700 align:middle line:84%
your normal person is
processing information certainly

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.390 align:middle line:84%
at a slower speed than what
you can do through computer,

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.650 align:middle line:90%
supercomputers and AI.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:24.650 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it is.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.980 align:middle line:10%
And so we're being exposed to
more information than ever,

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:10%
which is also creating a
little bit of overwhelm.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And in some people,
just flat out burnout.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Because you can only
take on so much data.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.530 align:middle line:90%
So collating data is one thing.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Collating information,
researching

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.890 align:middle line:84%
all of our writings and
thoughts and paper, everything

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.920 align:middle line:84%
that we've put out there,
AI is learning from.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's learning to almost
mimic human emotion.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Well, there's the
important word-- mimic.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, to mimic it.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:04.200 align:middle line:10%
So you know, what happens there
when it's learned and come

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.720 align:middle line:10%
to such a refined place
where it can mimic

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:10%
very refined and subtle
emotions, for example,

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:14.620 align:middle line:10%
in its text or in its
AI-generated characters?

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.880 align:middle line:90%
What happens then?

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.520 align:middle line:84%
How then do we know
the difference?

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Why are you giving
me that question like that?

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.010 align:middle line:90%
You're putting me on the spot.

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:90%
No--

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.955 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, I
mean, seriously,

00:13:25.955 --> 00:13:27.850 align:middle line:84%
it's going to start
looking like us.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.340 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to get to
the punchline in a bit here.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.130 align:middle line:90%
It will never be like us.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Like a
horse in the game,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.090 align:middle line:90%
ready to go to that end part.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:39.940 align:middle line:84%
The mimicking, there's something
that's coming into my mind.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.010 align:middle line:90%
Garbage in, garbage out.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you have these
computers loaded

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and they have this
knowledge, the knowledge--

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.890 align:middle line:84%
my definition is, the
knowledge is everything

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.460 align:middle line:90%
that's existing right now.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.800 align:middle line:90%
Quote, that is knowledge.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.690 align:middle line:10%
But what is the caliber
of that knowledge

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:01.400 align:middle line:10%
that these computers
are going to be

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.520 align:middle line:10%
loaded with everything that's
around, that's in existence--

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.520 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: All the
information that's ever been.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: --it's going to be
garbage, somewhat garbage.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:84%
What is going to designate and
separate even the information

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:17.810 align:middle line:90%
with computers?

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Is somebody going to go, oh,
this is really possibly true.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:90%
This is level 3.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:90%
This is level 4.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.660 align:middle line:10%
This may not be true, because
all those computers are doing

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.652 align:middle line:10%
is storing every single thing--

00:14:32.652 --> 00:14:33.860 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: It's bits of data.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: --that's out there.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:35.780 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.480 align:middle line:84%
We were talking earlier the
difference between information.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes, information is everything.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.630 align:middle line:84%
But my definition
is that's knowledge

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.580 align:middle line:90%
which is different than wisdom.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.530 align:middle line:10%
And how are you going
to use that knowledge.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:55.870 align:middle line:10%
Now, the computer is going to
work on its computerese saying,

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.440 align:middle line:10%
this is the answer.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:10%
However, human beings may
not work as fast processing,

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:07.090 align:middle line:10%
but we're going to come from
a slightly different area

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:11.920 align:middle line:10%
of the heart, and our
psyche, and what we believe

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.820 align:middle line:10%
is important.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.680 align:middle line:90%
Can a computer do that?

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.600 align:middle line:90%
This is part of our discussion.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Will it ever get to
the level that it's

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.820 align:middle line:90%
going to process like us?

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say no.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:31.300 align:middle line:10%
I believe it is not ever going
to reach because a human heart

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:35.093 align:middle line:10%
is different than a machine.

00:15:35.093 --> 00:15:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.510 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
that, too, a little bit more.

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.750 align:middle line:84%
But before we do,
you just brought up

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:44.150 align:middle line:84%
the notion, I was talking about,
information, stuffing data.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Data, refining data,
refining data, refining.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.040 align:middle line:90%
So it starts sounding human.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Mimicking human.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Even human emotions.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.330 align:middle line:84%
So we were just
talking about that,

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.840 align:middle line:84%
and you differentiate
between that and wisdom.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.720 align:middle line:90%
Now.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.100 align:middle line:10%
wisdom is something else.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And we did some
little pre-discussion.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And on your notes, you talk
about what defines wisdom.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And that has an element
of experience in it.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:09.930 align:middle line:84%
But it has another
element, too, which

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:15.060 align:middle line:84%
is how to make
wise choices based

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.960 align:middle line:84%
on all of the information we've
gathered throughout our life,

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.100 align:middle line:84%
all of the experience
throughout lifetimes.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Well, the fundamental
question always is,

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:32.710 align:middle line:84%
a decision was made because
it was a logical decision.

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:38.040 align:middle line:84%
A decision was made because
it came from the heart.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.630 align:middle line:10%
Now, are those the same?

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.070 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:84%
The logic may be this is
the best way to proceed.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.440 align:middle line:90%
This is the logical way.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:55.550 align:middle line:84%
But in our world that we
exist, so many of decisions

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:59.730 align:middle line:84%
have not been made because it
was, quote, the logical and best

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:00.530 align:middle line:90%
thing to do.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:04.467 align:middle line:84%
And what is logical for somebody
in the financial world--

00:17:04.467 --> 00:17:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's subject--
highly subjective,

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.675 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
world you're in.

00:17:07.675 --> 00:17:10.589 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Yeah, logic means
the bottom line making money.

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Or I do this because
it keeps my authority.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.470 align:middle line:90%
I do this, it keeps me powerful.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:20.329 align:middle line:84%
Those would all be logic
from that person's frame

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:21.300 align:middle line:90%
of reference.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And so wisdom is going to
come from being in the moment,

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:35.810 align:middle line:84%
making the best decision based
on where an individual is

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:40.650 align:middle line:84%
in their psyche, their
lifestyle, their environment.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And the computer
does not always have

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.510 align:middle line:84%
that kind of, quote,
wisdom within it

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:51.170 align:middle line:90%
to make those decisions.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.260 align:middle line:90%
This is why I'm separating that.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.200 align:middle line:10%
Now, maybe someone in the
audience in this field

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.350 align:middle line:10%
is going to go, well,
it keeps evolving

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.730 align:middle line:10%
and we're going to get to that.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.890 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
like sentient beings,

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and we should do this,
and we should do that.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:11.420 align:middle line:10%
Maybe they will and maybe they
won't, quote, have a heart.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.560 align:middle line:10%
Again, I'll go back.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.540 align:middle line:90%
A human is a human is a human.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm not against
machines, but they're not

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:26.210 align:middle line:84%
going to make the same decision
based on, quote, emotion.

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Because can you imagine even
trying to program that in?

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Emotion
is so complex.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:35.080 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
variables and so much

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.180 align:middle line:84%
history that goes
into an emotion.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.400 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that's
centered in the brain.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.020 align:middle line:90%
That's old science.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:42.820 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:43.737 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: I'm with you.

00:18:43.737 --> 00:18:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There's a lot
to create an emotion.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: I am with you.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.892 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: You said it because
I'm not even going to repeat it.

00:18:49.892 --> 00:18:51.070 align:middle line:90%
It is so perfect.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:54.700 align:middle line:84%
There's 8 billion people
on the planet, 6 billion.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is so
completely different.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's the
smallest, their emotion,

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.930 align:middle line:90%
their frame of reference.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:03.220 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:07.170 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody wants to
have an AI machine that

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.300 align:middle line:84%
is tailored
specifically for them,

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.220 align:middle line:84%
I would say good luck
with that because we

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:19.360 align:middle line:84%
would need so many different
variations to arrive.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:24.190 align:middle line:10%
Your show is based, again,
on higher consciousness.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:10%
You and I know each
other for many years.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.920 align:middle line:10%
You're here to empower people.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.760 align:middle line:10%
And so I'm going to keep
digressing a little.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here to
empower machines.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:39.640 align:middle line:90%
I think they have good aspects.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.940 align:middle line:84%
I believe from what
you've already said here,

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:48.230 align:middle line:84%
we're here to empower people
to rise to their highest

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.112 align:middle line:90%
state of awareness.

00:19:50.112 --> 00:19:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And not take the lazy
way out because a machine can do

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:53.820 align:middle line:90%
some of the lifting.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: I think
that's a question--

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.165 align:middle line:90%
do you want to get into it?

00:19:56.165 --> 00:19:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We will, but we'll
get into that in just a sec.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to say
that in real life,

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.700 align:middle line:84%
some of the best decisions
that are ever made

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.040 align:middle line:90%
are counterintuitive.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Right.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Seem
to be anti-logic.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So those are the kinds
of complex decisions

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:15.080 align:middle line:84%
you would think would be very
difficult for AI to come up

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.180 align:middle line:84%
with, because it's counter to
all of the data being presented.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.470 align:middle line:84%
But there's that some bit of
knowledge, hunch, or feeling

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.990 align:middle line:84%
that person has
and says, look, I'm

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.820 align:middle line:84%
going to go the opposite way
on this and I'll tell you why.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:10%
And that's not likely, those
kinds of creative solutions

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.330 align:middle line:10%
would be more difficult for AI
to achieve, I would imagine.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: But we're living in a
different time now where a lot

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.650 align:middle line:84%
of the young people who have
grown up with these devices,

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:46.540 align:middle line:84%
this is making
their life easier.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:10%
Rather than them coming
up with interfacing,

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:55.850 align:middle line:10%
it's easier to tell
someone we're breaking off,

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:57.560 align:middle line:10%
we're no longer together.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.660 align:middle line:84%
There's no interaction
emotionally

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:90%
from individual to individual.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And now it's going to keep going
deeper to where I don't have

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.530 align:middle line:90%
to think about this anymore.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:13.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to type
this in and it's all over,

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:17.680 align:middle line:84%
and this is the correct thing to
do because the machine told me.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.770 align:middle line:10%
This is why I thought
this show was important,

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:26.320 align:middle line:10%
because we have a big
separation taking place here

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.050 align:middle line:10%
between who we
are as individuals

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:35.500 align:middle line:10%
and getting too caught up
in the machine AI world that

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.550 align:middle line:10%
is taking us further away.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:44.110 align:middle line:10%
For young people to be on these
machines and not interacting,

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:46.752 align:middle line:10%
it's really altering.

00:21:46.752 --> 00:21:48.460 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: It's altering
our development.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: I mean, first of all,
I think our generation thought,

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.850 align:middle line:10%
what do you mean you can
use a calculator in class?

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:55.930 align:middle line:10%
Oh, no you don't.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.830 align:middle line:10%
So we would tell our kids, no,
learn how to do long division.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Learn how to do basic math
and fractions and all that.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.990 align:middle line:10%
Well, looking back on it, that
actually wasn't terrible advice

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:10%
for the simple reason
that not everybody,

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:11.430 align:middle line:10%
again, nothing
applies to everyone.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.750 align:middle line:84%
A lot of artists are
so right-brained.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:84%
It's like they always
struggled with math.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:20.490 align:middle line:10%
And they're not here because
of that aspect of their mind,

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:23.130 align:middle line:10%
and they're probably not going
to develop that muscle as

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:25.420 align:middle line:10%
strongly as the rest of us.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.630 align:middle line:84%
But there was
something to be said

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:30.190 align:middle line:84%
for having to develop
those muscles,

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:35.190 align:middle line:84%
those intellectual muscles,
and make the brain rigorous so

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.730 align:middle line:84%
that it can communicate in a
rigorous way, right and left

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:39.640 align:middle line:90%
hemisphere.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.970 align:middle line:84%
What happens when all
of the heavy lifting

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:44.810 align:middle line:84%
for the left
hemisphere of the brain

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:47.180 align:middle line:84%
is taken over
because you can just

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.630 align:middle line:90%
have a device do it for you?

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:53.240 align:middle line:84%
What happens to our
mental acuity over time

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.380 align:middle line:84%
in that respect, where we
have underdeveloped muscles,

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.180 align:middle line:90%
so to speak?

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.610 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:59.920 align:middle line:90%
I can't add anything to that.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: But that's
how good you are.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.713 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I answered
my own question.

00:23:03.713 --> 00:23:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: No, no, you
said it perfectly.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:05.970 align:middle line:10%
Much better than--

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: We're
just chatting now.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: --much better
than I would have.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, so I mean,
I think that is an issue.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.192 align:middle line:10%
And that change
started 30 years ago

00:23:14.192 --> 00:23:16.400 align:middle line:10%
when people started bringing
their little calculators

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.200 align:middle line:10%
to class.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, you have your devices.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:22.100 align:middle line:10%
And now I'm noticing that there
are a number of school districts

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.950 align:middle line:10%
and individual
schools who are trying

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:27.650 align:middle line:10%
to ban the use of
cell phones and have

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.840 align:middle line:10%
these little special
bags they put them in.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When the kids come to
school, they have to drop them,

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:84%
drop them off, and they can't
pick them up again until school

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:90%
is over.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're
finding the kids are

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.980 align:middle line:84%
starting to goof off
and socialize again

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.450 align:middle line:90%
at lunchtime and on recess.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:46.842 align:middle line:84%
This socialization is
happening in there--

00:23:46.842 --> 00:23:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Which is good.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Not surprised,
but very happy because they

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.830 align:middle line:84%
didn't know what they were going
to do besides grouse around

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:53.630 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.660 align:middle line:84%
But do you know who the
biggest obstacle was?

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.580 align:middle line:90%
It was the parents.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:84%
The parents want their kids to
be available to them and vice

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.070 align:middle line:90%
versa at all times.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:90%
Like life is one big emergency.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: And it's
a different world.

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:13.237 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm sure our parents
were saying the same thing.

00:24:13.237 --> 00:24:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, it was different.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:15.970 align:middle line:84%
It was like that
terrible musical

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:17.210 align:middle line:90%
take you straight to hell.

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: That's right.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:18.700 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.700 align:middle line:10%
It's interesting you mention
the schools because it brings up

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:25.570 align:middle line:10%
a fact that I've been hearing
that now, a lot of the schools

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:10%
don't even have
libraries, per se.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.820 align:middle line:10%
It's just banks of computers.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.680 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: They're eliminating
that, which is sad,

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.410 align:middle line:10%
because a variety of books
gives you a variety of opinions

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:39.260 align:middle line:10%
and thoughts.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.240 align:middle line:10%
Emerson said, when I
find narrow viewpoints,

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.130 align:middle line:10%
I find they're all reading.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:48.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's a truism for all time.

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:52.530 align:middle line:10%
And if you just have a bank of
computers that somebody's going,

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.580 align:middle line:10%
it's becoming a laziness.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.520 align:middle line:84%
There is a thing,
though, I'm going

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.540 align:middle line:84%
to play devil's advocate
for just a moment.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:04.560 align:middle line:10%
Most of the planet did not know
how to read until 100 years ago.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That doesn't
mean we were any less smart.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.170 align:middle line:84%
We were able-- it
was a simpler world.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:11.760 align:middle line:84%
We were able to
pass on knowledge.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And there were
always the scholars

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:16.580 align:middle line:84%
and the mystics that contain
vast amounts of knowledge

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.840 align:middle line:90%
in their minds.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And they would share
it with others.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:26.420 align:middle line:10%
And I've always wondered, was
it an unnatural thing to--

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.670 align:middle line:10%
and like you, I'm a book lover.

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:32.040 align:middle line:84%
In my house, my problem is, what
do I do with all these books?

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:37.760 align:middle line:84%
But is it a natural thing
to have reduced information,

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:43.360 align:middle line:84%
knowledge/wisdom to digits,
black digits on a white page

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.220 align:middle line:90%
to begin with?

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.300 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's just
something to think about.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.290 align:middle line:10%
And so if, say, for example,
that story can come alive

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:55.150 align:middle line:10%
through animated graphics
and storytelling, which

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:58.630 align:middle line:10%
AI is great at.

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:00.490 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: I think you need an
extra 20 minutes on your show

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.320 align:middle line:84%
because you just opened
up a whole other area.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:12.700 align:middle line:10%
The storytelling that was passed
on from the great teachers

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.910 align:middle line:10%
and each one of
the different areas

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:18.620 align:middle line:10%
would evoke because
people had to create.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.010 align:middle line:10%
It was the same way that
my folks said before TV,

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:25.643 align:middle line:10%
when you heard radio, you
would create in your mind.

00:26:25.643 --> 00:26:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: And that is really
being creative versus now when

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.550 align:middle line:84%
you're shown something,
OK, you're basically locked

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:37.310 align:middle line:84%
into that where the other
part, you have a very,

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:39.250 align:middle line:90%
very good point about.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:44.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, now there's letters on
pages versus the storytellers,

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:50.160 align:middle line:84%
the ancient one within a
culture who kept this wisdom,

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.290 align:middle line:90%
and the people sat and listened.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Yes, all of that has
really changed over time.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It has.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:00.847 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think ultimately,
oh, I'm not even Catholic.

00:27:00.847 --> 00:27:02.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know if I
did it the right way.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Please don't let books die just
because I love the experience.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.520 align:middle line:10%
Because you have
to-- your brain has

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.990 align:middle line:10%
to weave all of these
textures and stories,

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:13.680 align:middle line:10%
take digits and it's
like storytelling,

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.810 align:middle line:10%
and engage the rest
of the brain to create

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:17.560 align:middle line:10%
the pictures and the feelings.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.910 align:middle line:10%
I love it, but I have
a feeling it will go by

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.080 align:middle line:10%
and it'll be back like it was.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.620 align:middle line:84%
The scholars of the
world will have access

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:30.090 align:middle line:84%
to these ancient libraries like
Alexandria, like your library.

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:32.590 align:middle line:90%
What a gift to the planet.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: But see, that is why
I placed those 43,000 books

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:42.620 align:middle line:84%
on my phone because I don't
know what's going to happen

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:46.140 align:middle line:90%
in the future with materials.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:50.130 align:middle line:10%
And again, when we talk
about wisdom and knowledge,

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.640 align:middle line:10%
I have to say that I've
noticed a lot of reprints

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.140 align:middle line:10%
coming out in the
big publishing.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.650 align:middle line:84%
They've changed
some of the words.

00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.910 align:middle line:84%
I know because I
have the originals,

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and even a word being
changed here or there,

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.450 align:middle line:90%
changes the entire meaning.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So I, in my little way,
trying to keep that

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:16.713 align:middle line:84%
so that it's at least pristine
and somewhat like the originals.

00:28:16.713 --> 00:28:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to
say, anybody that

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.320 align:middle line:84%
wants to dive into
knowledge that's

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.670 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of years old on all
the forms of the way we address

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.960 align:middle line:84%
reality, the way we
can heal ourselves,

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.770 align:middle line:84%
the way we can expand our
capabilities and intuitive

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.410 align:middle line:84%
capacities, you have books
on every one of those

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:34.820 align:middle line:90%
in your personal library.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:38.180 align:middle line:10%
And people are allowed to
come and sit with those books.

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.820 align:middle line:10%
It's a stunning
experience and energy.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:44.450 align:middle line:10%
And I want to thank you
for upholding this way.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:46.570 align:middle line:10%
But now we're going
on to this age

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:49.720 align:middle line:10%
where the books are going to be,
if not burned-- some people are

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.950 align:middle line:10%
burning books-- they're
just going to go by.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I have a feeling, and it'll be
just a retro group of people

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:58.150 align:middle line:84%
that say, no, no, they'll be
underground printing presses

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:90%
where we can still reach--

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Reverting back to that,
people say things never change,

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.163 align:middle line:84%
and that would be a
big shame, definitely.

00:29:08.163 --> 00:29:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That would.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.570 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go to the
subject of the heart.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:13.220 align:middle line:84%
The heart of the
matter, the heart.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And I want to throw
something in here.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So Lee Harris and
I did a book together called

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:19.760 align:middle line:90%
The Future Human.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And in it, I asked the
Z's as a group of souls

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:24.680 align:middle line:90%
that we chat with.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.160 align:middle line:84%
We talked about everything
regarding our future

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.110 align:middle line:90%
as human beings.

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And they said the most dramatic
thing and wonderful thing that

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:37.440 align:middle line:84%
was going to happen
with humanity

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.110 align:middle line:84%
is we were going
to start allowing

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:45.240 align:middle line:84%
our mind and our thoughts
to melt now and start

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.600 align:middle line:90%
running through the heart.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.892 align:middle line:84%
So it wouldn't just be
intellectual any longer.

00:29:51.892 --> 00:29:54.600 align:middle line:10%
So now, from your point of view,
because you've talked about this

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.080 align:middle line:10%
forever, let's talk about the
significance of that statement

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.650 align:middle line:10%
that we start running our
minds, our thoughts and ideas

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:04.350 align:middle line:10%
through the heart.

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:08.940 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: We've already been
discussing that once reality is

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:13.450 align:middle line:10%
based on their thinking
and where their mind is,

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:19.590 align:middle line:10%
and so people can have vast
changes when their experiences

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:22.180 align:middle line:10%
change because
their mind sees, oh,

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:27.360 align:middle line:10%
this is a whole another
environment or lifestyle I never

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:32.220 align:middle line:10%
thought about, which then
changes their reality.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:37.610 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking about
the heart versus the mind,

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:43.700 align:middle line:84%
the heart and how it works,
it is a mind quote and mind

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:44.730 align:middle line:90%
to poor word.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:48.180 align:middle line:84%
It is a vehicle that
is so different.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:52.070 align:middle line:90%
It isn't just emotions.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:58.020 align:middle line:84%
To me, that heart is part of the
soul, the deeper aspects within.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And it is going to
operate from, quote,

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.290 align:middle line:90%
its wisdom from all times.

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:09.290 align:middle line:10%
The mind is like--

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:13.490 align:middle line:10%
when a spirit incarnates
into the physical body,

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:17.170 align:middle line:10%
the mind is like its
little hand computer,

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:20.520 align:middle line:10%
it's AI that does
different things for it.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:24.020 align:middle line:84%
But the heart, the
heart is connected

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:28.170 align:middle line:84%
to the deeper
aspects of who we are

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and the reality
of our existence.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And so operating
from that heart would

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:40.850 align:middle line:84%
be of the highest aspects
and growth of who we are.

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:43.250 align:middle line:90%
So I totally agree with that.

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It makes total sense.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
talking about the mind,

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:50.110 align:middle line:84%
too, it's usually
not differentiated

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.210 align:middle line:90%
in the common world.

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:54.302 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Certainly in the
world of media, mass media.

00:31:54.302 --> 00:31:58.700 align:middle line:84%
You and I are both fans of
hermetic texts in history.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:02.110 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things
the hermetic texts bring

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:04.360 align:middle line:10%
to the table is
the language they

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.450 align:middle line:10%
use in talking about
the aspects of mind

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:10.990 align:middle line:10%
and the difference between the
higher mind and the lower mind,

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:14.980 align:middle line:10%
which is an intermediary between
the soul and the lower mind.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Right now, everything
we're engaging with

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.710 align:middle line:84%
and everything with AI
is dealing exclusively

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:24.400 align:middle line:84%
with the lower mind, which
is to-- as my guides tried

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.820 align:middle line:90%
to make a joke one time.

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:26.990 align:middle line:90%
They're not funny.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:29.770 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, it's
just intended to keep you

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:31.133 align:middle line:90%
from bumping into things.

00:32:31.133 --> 00:32:32.050 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: That's right.

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And in fact, we
were never supposed to be run

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:36.810 align:middle line:90%
by the lower mind.

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:40.788 align:middle line:84%
It was always to have been the
higher mind that informed us

00:32:40.788 --> 00:32:43.080 align:middle line:84%
in this third dimensional
world to not bump into things

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.950 align:middle line:84%
or know when something's
on sale over at Target.

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And so this data that
we're getting with AI

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:52.360 align:middle line:90%
is all feeding the lower mind.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:58.590 align:middle line:10%
How are we going to preserve
the story and the notion

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.720 align:middle line:10%
that each of us has to
connect with the higher

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:05.310 align:middle line:10%
mind/soul in order to fulfill
what we're here to do, to love

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:07.650 align:middle line:10%
life, to love each other?

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: I hope your audience
knows how lucky they are.

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:12.160 align:middle line:84%
You don't even
really need a guest.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, you and
I are just in lockstep.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: You are so profound in
sharing what you just shared.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:23.490 align:middle line:10%
This is where I have often said
and expressed my philosophy.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And that is having
that beautiful heart.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.510 align:middle line:10%
And what do I mean by that?

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:33.100 align:middle line:10%
A heart filled with beauty.

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:36.240 align:middle line:84%
It was said by the ancients, if
you don't have beauty within,

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.790 align:middle line:84%
you don't recognize
beauty without.

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:43.020 align:middle line:84%
That is why people who are
defacing and painting on walls,

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:48.150 align:middle line:84%
they don't have that beauty
within to appreciate that.

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:51.090 align:middle line:10%
And so my philosophy
has always been,

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:54.290 align:middle line:10%
and which did come
from a dream, when

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:58.950 align:middle line:10%
one has a beautiful heart and an
open mind and a humble spirit,

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:06.860 align:middle line:10%
you are focused in to coming
from the heart and not the mind.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Because the second thing
I said with the open mind

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:13.760 align:middle line:84%
is to be totally in
the moment without

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.139 align:middle line:90%
any preconceived notions.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:20.610 align:middle line:10%
And when you're there, open
with a beautiful heart,

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:22.820 align:middle line:10%
operating from the
standpoint that I

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.550 align:middle line:10%
am going to let
love guide me, I'm

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:28.760 align:middle line:10%
going to do everything
with love, in love,

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:10%
and through love, you are
working from that heart rather

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:34.820 align:middle line:10%
than just the mind.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:38.170 align:middle line:10%
The mind will say, hey, I'm not
going to make any money if I

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:40.560 align:middle line:10%
give this away or if I do this.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.360 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking my time to
go and help this person.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.639 align:middle line:90%
That is working for the mind.

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:49.690 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
working from love,

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:53.380 align:middle line:84%
you're not calculating
and using the mind

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:54.739 align:middle line:90%
that you just mentioned.

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:57.940 align:middle line:10%
You're not using that mind
because basically our mind would

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:02.630 align:middle line:10%
say, wait a minute, I was going
to take my time to do this,

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:06.730 align:middle line:10%
and now my friend called
and wants me to help them?

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.600 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to do that.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:14.210 align:middle line:10%
That is when we're thinking
from our mind and calculating.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:16.690 align:middle line:84%
But when we're coming
from the heart, when

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:20.400 align:middle line:84%
we're doing things in love,
then everything changes.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You say, let
me finish my cup of tea,

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.200 align:middle line:90%
then I'll be over.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.550 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes, yes.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, but absolutely,
I understand what you're saying.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.112 align:middle line:90%
And so the problem--

00:35:31.112 --> 00:35:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and you just mentioned
something, beauty.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And beauty is a big
part of what you say.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.640 align:middle line:90%
A beautiful heart.

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
listening to this

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.530 align:middle line:84%
even is like, but how do
I think through my heart?

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:44.080 align:middle line:10%
So I led a little
meditation recently,

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:47.070 align:middle line:10%
just a little brief one in
which I said, OK, just close

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.110 align:middle line:10%
your eyes, think of some
thought that's maybe

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:51.640 align:middle line:10%
a little challenging, irksome,
just a little weighty,

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:52.750 align:middle line:10%
doesn't really matter.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:55.000 align:middle line:10%
And just close your eyes,
breathe a little bit.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And then now drop that heart,
that down into your heart.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Just take the thought and
visibly see yourself drop it,

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.740 align:middle line:84%
kerplunk into the heart and
sit with it for a moment

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and see what your thought
becomes, because it

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.300 align:middle line:90%
changes your thoughts.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It softens.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Judgment usually is the
first thing that goes away.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:14.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they said.

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:17.470 align:middle line:84%
That is how-- that
is our destiny.

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:21.400 align:middle line:10%
That is how humanity is going
to be living in the future.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.660 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: Well, and again, I
subscribe to what you're saying.

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:31.920 align:middle line:10%
And when you do the things with
love, in love, and through love,

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.770 align:middle line:10%
that's the equivalent of
dropping into the heart.

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:39.600 align:middle line:10%
So there's two ways you
can take whatever that,

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.960 align:middle line:10%
you know, I don't even
look at them as obstacles.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.750 align:middle line:84%
I look at things, challenges
as opportunities to grow.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A good
way to look at it.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: And somebody can fall
on their face because something

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.400 align:middle line:84%
brought them down
to their knees,

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.860 align:middle line:84%
or there was a
big boulder there.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.710 align:middle line:10%
And I guess the higher precept
would be to look at it and go,

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:08.040 align:middle line:10%
my soul has brought me
to learn a lesson here.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.400 align:middle line:84%
Gosh, from this
angle, the world looks

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.600 align:middle line:84%
a little different with
my face on the floor.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.800 align:middle line:90%
I never thought of looking--

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that's right.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: What direction
are we going to go?

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:24.050 align:middle line:84%
There are creative opportunities
to express and grow, even

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:26.220 align:middle line:84%
though on the surface
there may be a challenge.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of this does fit
in because, again, I asked,

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.170 align:middle line:90%
why are we here?

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:35.330 align:middle line:10%
Why do people
believe we're here?

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Is it to stuff all kinds
of knowledge and data

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.990 align:middle line:84%
into our faces and then
we go, and somebody goes,

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:48.020 align:middle line:84%
you know what, you
cross over into spirit,

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.030 align:middle line:84%
you didn't even
store it in yourself.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:52.520 align:middle line:90%
You had it in a hand device.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So that does not
make a lot of sense

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:58.810 align:middle line:84%
even for people on the
spiritual path to really-- you

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:00.860 align:middle line:90%
need to think about that.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.380 align:middle line:90%
Where has the gain really come?

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.470 align:middle line:90%
The computer told you to do it.

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:08.545 align:middle line:84%
It's like the devil
made me do it.

00:38:08.545 --> 00:38:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What are
we here for then?

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Why is every human
being on this planet

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:16.240 align:middle line:84%
right now, right now in
these unique times even?

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: My opinion, and
it's, again, only my opinion,

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:24.190 align:middle line:84%
my frame of reference, we are
here to demonstrate how we use

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:27.370 align:middle line:84%
the creative
energies that we are.

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, that does not mean you
have to be a singer or a dancer

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:32.320 align:middle line:90%
or write books.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.670 align:middle line:10%
What do you do in
your daily life?

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:41.550 align:middle line:10%
Are you creating within
yourself a greater understanding

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:44.970 align:middle line:10%
of your place in the
cosmos, your place

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:48.360 align:middle line:10%
with interacting with
the other souls that are

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.800 align:middle line:10%
with you on this planet Earth?

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Are you planting-- not creating,
but planting flowers or creating

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.030 align:middle line:90%
ground swells with the energy?

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:59.740 align:middle line:90%
To me, this is why we're here.

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:02.290 align:middle line:84%
How do we manage
that creative energy?

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:07.660 align:middle line:10%
Now, a greater discussion is
what we're actually capable of.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:11.550 align:middle line:10%
And that is people
have locked themselves

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:14.190 align:middle line:10%
in because you're
not supposed to-- now

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:15.910 align:middle line:10%
we're going the opposite way.

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:18.400 align:middle line:84%
You can't think for
yourself anymore.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you do this and you're
out of the box, that's not good.

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:28.220 align:middle line:10%
And so a discussion I had
recently, if people's belief

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.160 align:middle line:10%
system is, it's going to
take X amount of years

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:35.155 align:middle line:10%
to learn something, that's how
long it takes for an individual.

00:39:35.155 --> 00:39:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The
belief will trump.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:40.370 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: The belief, so I,
in all of our shows together,

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:42.530 align:middle line:10%
have tried to empower
people to understand,

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:49.760 align:middle line:10%
you have no conception of what
you're capable of unless you

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:55.460 align:middle line:10%
bring it into your awareness and
understand that we are unlimited

00:39:55.460 --> 00:40:02.180 align:middle line:10%
in our potential if we go within
and recognize we are greater

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:08.580 align:middle line:10%
than this physical body, we are
greater than any AI or computer.

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.570 align:middle line:10%
We have unlimited potential.

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:16.590 align:middle line:84%
If we bring our view
into that arena,

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.680 align:middle line:84%
rather than trying to figure
out, how can I do this faster?

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.580 align:middle line:84%
You're absolutely-- beautifully
said, absolutely true.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:26.290 align:middle line:10%
And there's some encouraging
stuff happening in pop culture

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:27.090 align:middle line:10%
right now.

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:30.550 align:middle line:84%
I came across something and I
thought, oh, I can't watch this.

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:31.780 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, watch it.

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.130 align:middle line:90%
And I'm glad I did.

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:36.970 align:middle line:10%
It's really for teens and people
in their young 20s, pretty much.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:38.800 align:middle line:90%
It features the Gen-Z.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's a show on
Netflix called Uglies.

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And what it is, is they
decided the world is now

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:49.980 align:middle line:84%
harmonious and peaceful
because we've eliminated

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.610 align:middle line:90%
all of our differences.

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And the final one is to
eliminate aesthetic differences.

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Everyone on their 16th birthday
has an operation where they

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:02.740 align:middle line:84%
become their idealized,
beautiful self, sparkling.

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:05.910 align:middle line:10%
Choose the color of eyes,
they're all choosing gold.

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:09.400 align:middle line:10%
And eyes, everything
to be perfect.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And so the uglies are those
who haven't reached their 16th

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.810 align:middle line:84%
birthday, and there's a
counter-rebellion saying,

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't want the operation
because what it does is it takes

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:22.300 align:middle line:90%
everything and flattens it.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's alike.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.120 align:middle line:84%
People don't think for
themselves anymore.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of contrast
is eliminated.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:32.460 align:middle line:10%
And the heroes are the
uglies who have chosen this--

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.970 align:middle line:10%
I won't give the plot away--
to go the other direction

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:36.420 align:middle line:10%
and refuse the operation.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:40.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a really kind of,
in-your-face, wonderful

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.810 align:middle line:90%
Gen-Z message, I think.

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:43.330 align:middle line:90%
They want to stay authentic.

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to
date us right now,

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:48.630 align:middle line:84%
but do you remember
the old Twilight Zone?

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: With Rod Sterling?

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.313 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: --Rod Sterling, yeah.

00:41:51.313 --> 00:41:55.020 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: So there was a great
episode where it starts off,

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.870 align:middle line:10%
they've got these doctors,
the doctors are wearing masks,

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:00.630 align:middle line:10%
and they're interviewing
a woman who you don't see.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:02.540 align:middle line:10%
And we're going
to do this surgery

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:04.290 align:middle line:10%
and try to make you look better.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:08.370 align:middle line:10%
And 30 minutes goes, and
at the very, very end,

00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:10.020 align:middle line:10%
it ends like this.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:14.390 align:middle line:84%
The surgeons take the
mask off the patient.

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:17.160 align:middle line:84%
The woman is
gorgeously beautiful.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.840 align:middle line:90%
They take their masks off.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.580 align:middle line:90%
They're all like a duck.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Their faces were all
exactly the same.

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:24.890 align:middle line:90%
They go, it didn't work.

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:25.910 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:27.080 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't convert her.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.300 align:middle line:84%
It's basically saying
the same thing.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.260 align:middle line:84%
She looked natural
and beautiful,

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:34.100 align:middle line:90%
and the surgeries were--

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.800 align:middle line:90%
everybody had to look like this.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:38.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Of course,
I do have a saying,

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.190 align:middle line:84%
I always joke with my wife,
why can't everybody be like us?

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:45.440 align:middle line:84%
But that's beside--
that's contrary--

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You don't want
siloed information here, Steven.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.433 align:middle line:84%
We got to have
contrast to learn from.

00:42:50.433 --> 00:42:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: There you go.

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So finally, just
kind of going back for a moment

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.480 align:middle line:90%
and wrapping this up.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.930 align:middle line:10%
The thing that Z's
finally said was

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:01.780 align:middle line:10%
that this ability
of the human being

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.780 align:middle line:10%
to take our mind, our
creativity, and everything,

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:08.230 align:middle line:10%
and run it through
that pristine lens life

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:12.280 align:middle line:10%
force, the heart itself will be
the thing that will distinguish

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:16.850 align:middle line:10%
us from AI no matter how real
it starts appearing to be.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:19.160 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: Yes, I do
want to share a dream.

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.420 align:middle line:90%
I think we're at the end.

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And a dream which I had,
this was 14 years ago.

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:29.400 align:middle line:84%
I was walking, again, maybe I
put it on a show, previous show.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.410 align:middle line:84%
I was walking with all the
truth-seekers of the world.

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:33.730 align:middle line:90%
We were walking together.

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:35.050 align:middle line:90%
They weren't following me.

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:36.780 align:middle line:10%
And in the distance,
we saw a woman

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.850 align:middle line:10%
dressed in blue
holding a microphone,

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:44.350 align:middle line:10%
and she was partially
covered with a fog or smoke.

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:49.110 align:middle line:10%
And as we got up to her, it was
Sophia, the goddess of wisdom.

00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And to my right or her
left were horseshoe

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:55.380 align:middle line:84%
stands with all the book
authors and the people

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.700 align:middle line:90%
with courses and the lecturers.

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And I am not saying what
they were saying was false,

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:04.300 align:middle line:84%
but they all had only
a piece of the story.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And their words, their
smoke was covering her.

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered at
that moment, what

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:16.030 align:middle line:84%
are we supposed to do
to find absolute truth?

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:19.020 align:middle line:10%
And a big wind
blew off the ocean.

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:21.220 align:middle line:90%
And the following words came.

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:25.640 align:middle line:84%
All one needs is a beautiful
heart and open mind

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.690 align:middle line:90%
and a humble spirit.

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which to
me-- that's your motto.

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:30.450 align:middle line:90%
That's you.

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:31.880 align:middle line:90%
You live that way.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:32.850 align:middle line:90%
You represent that.

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: We do.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:35.550 align:middle line:90%
And how do we do it?

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:39.780 align:middle line:84%
With love, in love,
and through love.

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the books are
exciting and the lecturers

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:47.910 align:middle line:84%
are great, and the I. But
what does it boil down to?

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:50.810 align:middle line:84%
It boils down to the
most simplistic things

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:52.410 align:middle line:90%
that we've been discussing.

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:55.400 align:middle line:10%
A beautiful heart is
just seeing the beauty

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.140 align:middle line:10%
in every single thing.

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:02.480 align:middle line:10%
Being open, which means in the
moment, live in the moment.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.360 align:middle line:10%
And of course, a
difficult one for a lot

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:09.810 align:middle line:10%
of the people, high profile,
is that humble part.

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:14.270 align:middle line:10%
Because when we're closed,
we have no fresh input

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:15.900 align:middle line:10%
to what's coming in.

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:21.050 align:middle line:10%
So yes, I ascribe to what
you shared with the heart

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:22.410 align:middle line:10%
being important.

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:24.520 align:middle line:10%
I've been directed
by my guidance

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:31.370 align:middle line:10%
to really use that phrase and
bring people back to going,

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:35.230 align:middle line:10%
don't make it so difficult.
People are selling courses

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:38.150 align:middle line:10%
and you've got to buy my six
books to reach enlightenment.

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:39.270 align:middle line:10%
That's nonsense.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: I mean, it may be fun,
and if that's your pleasure

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:44.300 align:middle line:90%
in doing it.

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:50.050 align:middle line:10%
But working from our heart,
something the AI is never--

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:54.520 align:middle line:10%
it's never going to have,
quote, a human heart,

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:58.430 align:middle line:10%
is the secret to
greater enlightenment,

00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:01.760 align:middle line:10%
and the gifts will
come as needed.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.410 align:middle line:10%
And what do I mean by that?

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:06.550 align:middle line:10%
When you look to help
another human being

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:08.780 align:middle line:10%
and you're coming
from the heart,

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.060 align:middle line:10%
you can do miraculous things.

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:12.380 align:middle line:90%
You can help heal them.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.790 align:middle line:90%
And we know that you do that.

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:15.950 align:middle line:84%
You've done seemingly
miraculous things.

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:17.855 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: And we know
that you do that.

00:46:17.855 --> 00:46:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's that
with you one time.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: That's exactly right.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, but that's the
gift we all have for each other.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.310 align:middle line:90%
And you're absolutely right.

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Beautifully said,
everything you just said.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:29.050 align:middle line:84%
The fact is AI is
throughout the universe.

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:30.430 align:middle line:90%
AI is on other planets.

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:33.700 align:middle line:10%
AI has been around as long as
we've been able to create it.

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And so our position now
at this time in history

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.752 align:middle line:84%
is to decide how we want to
use it, not let it use us.

00:46:39.752 --> 00:46:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yeah, how beautiful.

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
the end of that one.

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.780 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Steven, thank you so
much for your beautiful spirit,

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.460 align:middle line:10%
as always.

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Well, I thank you.

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And I said I never take
these visits for granted.

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:56.490 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate you, I
appreciate you allowing me

00:46:56.490 --> 00:47:01.080 align:middle line:84%
the time to share my
viewpoint to your audience.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's my pleasure.

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I hope you enjoyed
this conversation.

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I have several other
interviews with Steven

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:08.590 align:middle line:90%
