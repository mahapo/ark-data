00:00:27.872 --> 00:00:29.330 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
I can't tell you

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:10%
how many times
people have asked me

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.980 align:middle line:10%
how they're supposed to connect
with their guides or angels

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.240 align:middle line:10%
when they need help.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Because each of us
is very different,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.200 align:middle line:84%
that answer is
difficult. So I invited

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.290 align:middle line:84%
one of my very favorite people,
Joan Walker, back on our show

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.440 align:middle line:84%
after a three year absence
to speak with her archangels

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:84%
about this topic, which is
really a critical topic.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.760 align:middle line:84%
People feel so stranded and
alone here on Earth, right?

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.380 align:middle line:10%
>>JOAN WALKER:
Right, and they feel

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.885 align:middle line:10%
very separate from
whatever part of the I

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:03.170 align:middle line:10%
am presence or God
presence, that that's

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.980 align:middle line:10%
up way beyond their reach,
and that's not correct.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's not.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:84%
We're a unique species,
no doubt about it.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.560 align:middle line:90%
We need help.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.980 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that
most people aren't

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:84%
even aware they can ask for
help is part of, I think,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:84%
the frustration not just
here, but in the other realm.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.280 align:middle line:90%
They're standing by.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.750 align:middle line:84%
I imagine our guides
on smoke breaks,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.790 align:middle line:84%
like waiting for someone
to ask for some help.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.560 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLE]

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Well, in this realm of
experience, we have free will.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.890 align:middle line:84%
So your guides, your angels,
the archangel community,

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.680 align:middle line:84%
the master community,
cannot interfere with what

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.250 align:middle line:90%
you're creating in your reality.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: And so it's very,
very important that you ask.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So in order to do that, you
have to take time for yourself.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.290 align:middle line:84%
You have to have some sort
of what I call prayer time.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.009 align:middle line:84%
But it's not petitioning,
"Oh Lord, help me with this,

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.510 align:middle line:90%
or give me that."

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.290 align:middle line:84%
It's about setting
up a communication

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.410 align:middle line:84%
with that higher
aspect of yourself,

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.370 align:middle line:84%
the source of your
being, that God essence.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And then inviting
into your experience

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.950 align:middle line:84%
the intercession of maybe your
guardian angel or your guides

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:90%
that are all around you.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.660 align:middle line:84%
You have a whole
community at your access.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.657 align:middle line:84%
Why not begin to invite
them into your space?

00:02:45.657 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:84%
But most people say,
oh, that's all cool,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.590 align:middle line:84%
but once they get there, I don't
know how to hear them anyway.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.180 align:middle line:84%
That's probably the most
common retort to that--

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --is, how
am I supposed to know

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.173 align:middle line:90%
what they're saying to me?

00:02:57.173 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when I was
thinking about this topic,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.650 align:middle line:84%
I thought, why not ask the
guides how we're supposed to?

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Rather than us telling
people our particular method

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.690 align:middle line:84%
of connecting with them, why
not ask them on the other side

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.170 align:middle line:90%
how we best reach them?

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.690 align:middle line:84%
It seems like a
great conversation.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.231 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: It is a
great conversation,

00:03:16.231 --> 00:03:20.100 align:middle line:84%
but it's a very
individualized experience.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: And it
isn't taken lightly.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
everyone has the ability

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.600 align:middle line:84%
to be a channel or a mystic
in some way, a medium.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.610 align:middle line:84%
But you do have the
ability to communicate

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.060 align:middle line:90%
with the source of who you are.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And this takes private
time, and a lot of people

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.739 align:middle line:90%
aren't willing to do that.

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a process.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: To get
into the magic of it.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's not.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.205 align:middle line:84%
It's about building
a relationship.

00:03:56.205 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Just like you
do with a close friend.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.114 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: So that's the first
and most important thing.

00:04:04.114 --> 00:04:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is, and everybody
gets there a different way.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And it may be 5 minutes
out of your day,

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.930 align:middle line:84%
it may be 10 minutes,
whatever feels right.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It may
take you 20 years

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.615 align:middle line:84%
to create the
relationship itself.

00:04:15.615 --> 00:04:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Not really.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.769 align:middle line:90%
In these times, not really.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.980 align:middle line:84%
If you are diligent, it
happens very quickly.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Now that doesn't mean
that you hear voices,

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:84%
or you see visions, but
you will have inspiration.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.430 align:middle line:84%
You will have thoughts
that come to you.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.260 align:middle line:84%
It's important that you write
those down and then look back

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.100 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Wait a week or two weeks,
and then read your journal.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a wealth of information,
that ideas and thoughts come

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.600 align:middle line:90%
to you, feelings come to you.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.190 align:middle line:90%
You have to pay attention.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.422 align:middle line:84%
And we usually think,
ugh, later, that's random.

00:04:52.422 --> 00:04:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yeah, I'm too busy.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm too busy.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.510 align:middle line:84%
So before we begin and go
to the Triad of Beings,

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.820 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about that
in a minute, first,

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.260 align:middle line:84%
for those people who haven't
met you yet in our audience--

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.760 align:middle line:84%
because it has been three years,
we have lots of new viewers

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.970 align:middle line:90%
since then--

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.140 align:middle line:84%
let's get a little flavor first
about how you initially came

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.670 align:middle line:90%
into contact with your beings.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll share a little bit
about my kooky entrÃ©e into all

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.190 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.106 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Well, it was
kind of a kooky for me.

00:05:21.106 --> 00:05:22.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
it, because you were, what?

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.550 align:middle line:90%
A Catholic housewife.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yes.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, by that time,
I was in business.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I had my own business, and I
had a lot of responsibilities

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.400 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of stress.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I
was raising four kids.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.338 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: So needless
to say, there

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.790 align:middle line:84%
were a lot of times my
life wasn't working.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, the
foundations of my spirituality

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.380 align:middle line:84%
was in a prayer life that was
taught to me as an early child,

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.300 align:middle line:84%
even though it wasn't
working for me,

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.465 align:middle line:84%
and I had kind of pushed that
aside several years prior.

00:05:58.465 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:90%


00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:84%
I started looking because
I knew there was something

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.450 align:middle line:90%
that I was missing.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.072 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to a
metaphysical bookstore,

00:06:10.072 --> 00:06:11.530 align:middle line:84%
and started reading
a lot of books,

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
and developed a
meditation practice

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.890 align:middle line:84%
that helped me stay
centered, and calm,

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.830 align:middle line:90%
and eliminate some of my stress.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it just
evolved from there.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And in my meditation practice,
I would get these thoughts.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was like,
wow, that's good.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But when I would
get to work or get

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.510 align:middle line:84%
involved in my day-to-day
life, I would forget them.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.020 align:middle line:84%
So I decided I needed
to write that down.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.240 align:middle line:90%
So that's how it began.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I had this
presence I felt within me

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:90%
in my solar plexus.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I was
meditating in another room,

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and my husband was watching
a ballgame in another room.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, there's
something going on here,

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.581 align:middle line:90%
and it really is scaring me.

00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:08.830 align:middle line:90%
And he said, oh, you'll be OK.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.330 align:middle line:90%
Go lay down on the bed.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden,
it was my guide.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.370 align:middle line:90%
We have been waiting for you.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.190 align:middle line:90%
And there were three of them.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:90%
And so that's how it started.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.287 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You said
this out loud?

00:07:23.287 --> 00:07:25.120 align:middle line:84%
They were letting you
know, or did you say--

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: No, this
feeling inside of me

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.400 align:middle line:90%
just had to come out.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.825 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: So I took
a big, deep breath,

00:07:31.825 --> 00:07:34.182 align:middle line:84%
and, boy, that
drew his attention.

00:07:34.182 --> 00:07:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your
husband's attention.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: So he paid attention.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately for
me, at that time,

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.390 align:middle line:84%
he had this little
handheld recorder

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:48.100 align:middle line:84%
that he would record, in
his business life, letters

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.355 align:middle line:90%
that his secretary was to type.

00:07:50.355 --> 00:07:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm, a
little dictation machine.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yeah.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And so he grabbed it and
recorded what I had said.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:90%
And so that's how it started.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
went on a little bit.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.180 align:middle line:90%
You just started talking.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Yeah, I
just started talking.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what
was on that first tape?

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Well, they
introduced themselves.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And then they just said they had
been with me for a very, very

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.260 align:middle line:84%
long time, and this was not
the first incarnation that they

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260 align:middle line:84%
had been with me, and
that they were here

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:84%
to make me aware of
who I was and why

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:84%
I had come into this
particular incarnation.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.309 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can you share that?

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Well,
first of all, they

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:84%
said they came for me to
awaken my consciousness,

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:53.210 align:middle line:84%
and that through my
patterning from childhood,

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:57.550 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of negative programs
that I would have to release

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.230 align:middle line:90%
and change my mind about.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.830 align:middle line:90%
And they were there to help me.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.110 align:middle line:90%
So that's how it started.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:90%
It was for me.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:07.240 align:middle line:84%
It was not for the
world or any of that.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
20 years later

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:18.340 align:middle line:84%
that, one time, I was engaged
in receiving information,

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:23.230 align:middle line:90%
and Lord Metatron came.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And it just took my
breath away because

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:31.730 align:middle line:90%
of the energy behind that.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he had
brought with him a teacher that

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.640 align:middle line:84%
was going to be with
me for some time,

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.000 align:middle line:90%
and that was Master Kuthumi.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And then through Master
Kuthumi, he said,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.600 align:middle line:90%
I have a project for you--

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.870 align:middle line:84%
I want you to teach a
meditation practice.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:53.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's all he said.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't tell
me that I was going

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:03.640 align:middle line:84%
to be required to communicate
a whole series of teaching

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:09.460 align:middle line:84%
that he called a curriculum on
awakening the self-awareness

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:14.890 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness of individuals
on just how they were connected

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.400 align:middle line:90%
to vast regions of creation.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.440 align:middle line:90%
So that's how that started.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And here we are now.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.350 align:middle line:90%
And I'll share this.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.430 align:middle line:90%
I'll just make it brief.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:27.370 align:middle line:84%
It was totally undisciplined
and unexpected,

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.250 align:middle line:84%
but I had been playing
around a little bit.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.710 align:middle line:84%
One day, I was jogging,
and I had my normal route

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:34.510 align:middle line:90%
around the park.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And this particular day,
I was lazy, and I thought,

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.190 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll cut
off that leg of it,

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.050 align:middle line:90%
and just turn right and go home.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.550 align:middle line:90%
But I couldn't turn right.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Something was pushing my body
so that I couldn't turn right.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.450 align:middle line:90%
I had to keep going.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
what's that about?

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.082 align:middle line:90%
Who's pushing me?

00:10:50.082 --> 00:10:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So I just finished up, and
I was a little more tired.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I didn't
want to run that far.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.220 align:middle line:84%
So I got home, and then I
had this very clear feeling

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.480 align:middle line:90%
to sit down.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.394 align:middle line:84%
And a friend and I had
bought a Ouija board,

00:11:02.394 --> 00:11:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and we had been playing with
the Ouija board a little bit,

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.850 align:middle line:84%
just having fun with it,
nothing scary at all.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.775 align:middle line:84%
And I had this sudden
urge I was supposed

00:11:09.775 --> 00:11:12.400 align:middle line:84%
to take the Ouija board out, but
there was no one there but me.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.200 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, this
is a little crazy.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And it said on the Ouija
board, go get a pencil.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:90%
Go to your typewriter.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.220 align:middle line:84%
No-- go get a pencil
and paper first.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.480 align:middle line:90%
So this happened really fast.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.120 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.940 align:middle line:84%
I got a pencil and paper, a big
drawing pad and had a pencil.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I am not going
to consciously participate

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.300 align:middle line:90%
in what's going on.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle line:90%
I'll just look the other way.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So I just was like this,
looked the other way,

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and put my hand up, and said, if
something's supposed to happen,

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:90%
do something.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.700 align:middle line:84%
So my hands started
moving very rapidly.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And after I looked at it
later on, at the end of that,

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.160 align:middle line:84%
it was perfect circles over
each other, perfect lines,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.560 align:middle line:84%
perfect loops, but they were
right on top of each other.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.726 align:middle line:90%
And all I felt was movement.

00:11:54.726 --> 00:11:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK,
well, something

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.750 align:middle line:84%
wants to practice handwriting
so they can probably

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.190 align:middle line:90%
do automatic writing.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.420 align:middle line:90%
I'd heard of it.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And then they said, pretty
quickly, go to the typewriter.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.359 align:middle line:90%
Let's speed this thing up.

00:12:08.359 --> 00:12:09.400 align:middle line:90%
I went to the typewriter.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.905 align:middle line:84%
And same thing, I'm sitting,
I'm not going to do anything.

00:12:11.905 --> 00:12:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I left my hands in my
lap and closed my eyes.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, almost
like balloons on my hands,

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.240 align:middle line:84%
my hands floated up and
gently hit the keys.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And I closed my eyes
and said, whatever,

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.310 align:middle line:90%
and they just started flying.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And as each word
was being typed,

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.670 align:middle line:84%
I was aware of the words at
that moment, but not prior.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I went back and looked at
it, and it was quite coherent.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:40.810 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And so it progressed
on from there

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.802 align:middle line:84%
to, you don't need
the typewriter,

00:12:44.802 --> 00:12:46.510 align:middle line:84%
if you can hear the
words while we do it,

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.830 align:middle line:90%
you can hear the words.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And very rapidly,
that progressed

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.600 align:middle line:84%
into listening, and
then little, kind

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.530 align:middle line:84%
of secret handshake,
which was a funny feeling

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.339 align:middle line:90%
on the top of the head.

00:12:55.339 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Each one brought a
different feeling.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And thus, it began to
start, just simple.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Same thing for myself,
basic Q&A stuff--

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing here?

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.370 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing here?

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was
just for me, that weird,

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:84%
little day where
it had been decided

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.550 align:middle line:84%
that would be the day I'd
begin doing automatic typing,

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.440 align:middle line:84%
and that lasted for
that little while,

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and then it went
on till I didn't

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.860 align:middle line:90%
need the devices anymore.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.367 align:middle line:84%
And each person I've talked to,
the channeler, Sheila Gillette,

00:13:24.367 --> 00:13:26.950 align:middle line:84%
she started with the Ouija board
doing the same kind of thing,

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:27.850 align:middle line:90%
playing.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has their
own path to this.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's
no right, no wrong.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:32.533 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: No wrong, mm-mm.

00:13:32.533 --> 00:13:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it can be
way weirder than that.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Some people have it through
near-death experiences.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, things are
made available to them

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.390 align:middle line:84%
that they could hear that
they couldn't hear prior.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:48.566 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: How many
people out there have--

00:13:48.566 --> 00:13:49.940 align:middle line:84%
say they were
going to the store.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.010 align:middle line:84%
I've had this
experience early on.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:57.921 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of was cloudy,
and something in my mind said,

00:13:57.921 --> 00:14:00.170 align:middle line:84%
take an umbrella Ann, because
you're going to need it.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: And if I would
pay attention to that,

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.120 align:middle line:90%
everything was fine.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.860 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't, it'd be
pouring down rain,

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:15.410 align:middle line:84%
and I would get soaking
wet going back to my car.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Or at work, I had this sense
that I needed to pay attention

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.690 align:middle line:90%
to a certain thing.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:28.520 align:middle line:84%
So I learned over the years,
even before my gifts started

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:33.380 align:middle line:84%
taking hold within me, that
there were things going on

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.920 align:middle line:84%
that I kind of took for
granted or just really didn't

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.970 align:middle line:90%
pay attention to.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.050 align:middle line:84%
That's one of those
things Master Kuthumi

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.020 align:middle line:90%
used to tell me often, often--

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.280 align:middle line:90%
you don't pay attention.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:51.235 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.235 --> 00:14:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
that he said is

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.980 align:middle line:90%
that you have senses, use them.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Your body senses things.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:06.980 align:middle line:84%
You have ideas that
just magically appear.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Those are the
things that they are

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.580 align:middle line:90%
sending you to help you along.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Your guides, maybe
your archangel,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:84%
says, pay attention to
something, your guardian angel.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
things that recur often

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.850 align:middle line:84%
in everyone's life in
one way or another.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:33.090 align:middle line:90%
So it's about paying attention.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And everybody that's
listening or watching

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.532 align:middle line:84%
can relate to that because
we've all had these experiences,

00:15:39.532 --> 00:15:41.990 align:middle line:84%
and we all know what it's like
when we don't pay attention.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And so then you learn
to develop those.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:90%
You hone the skills.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So what is an individual asset,
a beautiful talent or ability,

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:01.790 align:middle line:84%
that has laid really
deep in your unconscious

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.460 align:middle line:90%
has an opportunity to surface.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:10.250 align:middle line:84%
You have come into this lifetime
with certain gifts for you

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:14.900 align:middle line:84%
to share, and gifts that you use
for your own self-development

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.730 align:middle line:90%
and evolvement.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to us
to uncover those.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.150 align:middle line:84%
So with that, a
little later on, we'll

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.370 align:middle line:84%
talk about some other
things going on in your life

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.930 align:middle line:84%
right now, but
with that, shall we

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:30.680 align:middle line:84%
go ahead and talk to
the Triad of Beings?

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Well,
that would be great.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's
talk about who they are.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: OK.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:42.800 align:middle line:84%
There is, in recent times, in
some of the group gatherings

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:49.580 align:middle line:84%
that we hold, that
instead of an individual

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.440 align:middle line:90%
coming forth through me--

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.050 align:middle line:84%
such as Master
Kuthumi, or Metatron,

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:55.700 align:middle line:90%
or Archangel Michael--

00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.020 align:middle line:84%
they have started
coming, first, in what

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.540 align:middle line:84%
they call triadic
collective consciousness.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:08.839 align:middle line:84%
And so they are showing us, they
are starting to teach humanity

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:12.890 align:middle line:84%
that, yes, you are this
individual expression

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:17.569 align:middle line:84%
of the divine, but
you also are part

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:21.050 align:middle line:84%
of a vast collective
consciousness.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And this operates
simultaneously.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:28.069 align:middle line:84%
So this particular
triadic configuration

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:32.010 align:middle line:84%
is a very powerful
configuration.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:36.750 align:middle line:84%
It is Metatron, Lord
Metatron, Lord Michael,

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:40.880 align:middle line:84%
who is also an archangel,
and Lord Melchizedek.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And so they just
come and speak as

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:48.470 align:middle line:84%
this collective
consciousness with the intent

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:52.700 align:middle line:84%
to help humanity evolve
their consciousness

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.290 align:middle line:90%
and their awareness.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And is
this the group--

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:84%
is this collective mostly what's
coming through you these days?

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Or did they just let you know
that's what's happening today?

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Sometimes, it will be
the collective of all that is.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: It will
be a collective

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.870 align:middle line:90%
of the divine feminine.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.190 align:middle line:90%
It varies.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.218 align:middle line:90%
But they gave you a heads up.

00:18:17.218 --> 00:18:18.510 align:middle line:90%
It'd be these three today.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:24.460 align:middle line:84%
They always tell you who they
are and why they're there.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: And that was
part of an agreement

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:84%
that, early on, I had made,
because I own the body.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, you want to
know who's talking through it.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:37.992 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
with that in mind,

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:40.866 align:middle line:84%
we'll go ahead and
go to the triad

00:18:40.866 --> 00:18:43.530 align:middle line:90%
of these wonderful beings.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And we'll let you disappear
for a little while,

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.935 align:middle line:84%
and then when you come back,
we'll chat about things, OK?

00:18:47.935 --> 00:18:49.302 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: OK, that'll be great.

00:18:49.302 --> 00:19:11.420 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Greetings.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:20.960 align:middle line:84%
It is the triad configuration
of Metatron, Michael,

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:90%
and Melchizedek.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:28.130 align:middle line:84%
We have come as a sector of
the collective consciousness

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:33.660 align:middle line:84%
of the all that is to speak
with you at this time.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:41.050 align:middle line:84%
It is so important,
beloveds, for humanity

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:50.740 align:middle line:84%
to rise up, release the old
programming of denser times,

00:19:50.740 --> 00:20:01.400 align:middle line:84%
and realize the creativity
that each individual possesses,

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
to realize that you are part of
this vast, harmonic collective

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:15.555 align:middle line:84%
consciousness that is in
the midst of great change.

00:20:15.555 --> 00:20:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Change the world
in which you live.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Bring it in out of separation,
division, polarization,

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and bring forth the new era
that is based in love and unity.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly, building
a coherence within the divine

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:49.590 align:middle line:84%
energies within each
and every one of you,

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:54.380 align:middle line:84%
but also that coherence within
the collective consciousness

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.270 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:21:03.170 align:middle line:84%
It is time now,
time long passed,

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:10.370 align:middle line:84%
since we bring you through our
guidance into this new era.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:16.400 align:middle line:84%
The question that I have for
each and every one of you--

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.400 align:middle line:84%
will you do this in
chaos, or will you

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.780 align:middle line:84%
do it in peace, and
harmony, and love?

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:35.310 align:middle line:84%
There is a way that this can be
manifested by each individual,

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and that is going into
the center of your being,

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:45.270 align:middle line:84%
being very still, into
that beautiful sacred heart

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.680 align:middle line:90%
of yours.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Each and every
one of you possess

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:55.620 align:middle line:84%
a coherent consciousness
within that heart.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And when you concentrate
on opening that heart,

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:08.520 align:middle line:84%
first and foremost, to
yourself, and realize

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:14.350 align:middle line:84%
that you are loved beyond
your comprehension,

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and start to understand that
the first step you have to take

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:27.390 align:middle line:84%
is seeing the value that
you bring to the world.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:32.280 align:middle line:84%
At this very moment, you
don't have to fully understand

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:39.910 align:middle line:84%
why you are here, but you
do have to value yourself

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:47.560 align:middle line:84%
as a being, a divine being, made
in the image of your creator.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
you have great value.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:84%
You have taken on an
incarnation into a physical body

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.810 align:middle line:90%
to assist in great change.

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And that change,
beloveds, starts with you.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
thank you for that.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And you said a moment ago that
this change is long overdue.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see, looking
at the energies of our planet

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.960 align:middle line:84%
right now and certainly
this part of the world,

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.210 align:middle line:84%
we have gone more into
separation, fear, judgement,

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:26.010 align:middle line:90%
anger.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.770 align:middle line:84%
All this has happened
and been building up

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.660 align:middle line:84%
over the last couple
of decades because I

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.870 align:middle line:84%
guess the change didn't happen
when it could have earlier.

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Everything that has happened
in recent events, what's it

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:44.370 align:middle line:84%
look like from where
you sit, energetically?

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Well, energetically,
it's not as fragmented

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.980 align:middle line:90%
as you might see.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Share that, please.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: There are many
factions working, many states

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.730 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness playing
out in the physical realm,

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:08.460 align:middle line:84%
not just on your planet,
but in this entire sector

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.110 align:middle line:90%
of your universe.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain a little
more about that, the change

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.010 align:middle line:90%
you speak of in the times.

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:15.607 align:middle line:90%
This extends out?

00:24:15.607 --> 00:24:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Of course.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: One of the
significant things

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:24.450 align:middle line:84%
is that Earth, in
its origination,

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:27.420 align:middle line:84%
was a 12-dimensional
Christed planet.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:34.790 align:middle line:84%
It was the only physical
planet in this sector of,

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:38.940 align:middle line:84%
not just the galaxy,
not just the universe,

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:43.400 align:middle line:84%
but the cosmos, that
had a semblance of form.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:84%
It was a beautiful creation
from the realm of source.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: And as
individuals came and created

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:58.930 align:middle line:84%
in that environment,
they wanted to create

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:05.200 align:middle line:84%
more denseness, more tangible,
and experiment with that.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Where we find ourselves today
is in a very dense environment,

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:18.380 align:middle line:84%
a dimensional denseness
that plays out as separation

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.550 align:middle line:90%
through separation and fear.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So what you're seeing in some
of this havoc and disruption

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:29.030 align:middle line:90%
is fear of survival.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:37.610 align:middle line:84%
That is a great imprint in
the consciousness of humanity

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:42.290 align:middle line:84%
that operates in what you call
that third, fourth-dimensional

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:43.700 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And what is desired,
what a vast portion of,

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:55.130 align:middle line:84%
not just the great beings in
the various realms of creation,

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:59.360 align:middle line:84%
but humanity itself,
uplifting humanity

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:05.390 align:middle line:84%
to its original state with full
consciousness of themselves

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:10.640 align:middle line:84%
as divine creators and also
as a collective consciousness

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.480 align:middle line:90%
of the divine.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:19.880 align:middle line:84%
So what you are seeing, what
is publicized in your media,

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:25.760 align:middle line:84%
is the chaos because it sells
papers, it sells TV programs,

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.120 align:middle line:90%
it sells news.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is not a
really adequate picture.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:42.080 align:middle line:84%
There are many unnamed masters
walking your planet today

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:49.160 align:middle line:84%
that walk in that beautiful
consciousness of Earth's

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.410 align:middle line:90%
original state.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And they are here to
make a difference,

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.870 align:middle line:84%
some just by their
presence, just

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:00.890 align:middle line:84%
by who they are and
the energy they carry.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Do you realize, when you
interact with others,

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:12.530 align:middle line:84%
that you change that individual,
sometimes for their betterment,

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:18.300 align:middle line:84%
sometimes for their
upliftment, by what you say,

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.620 align:middle line:84%
how open your heart is, not
just to them, but openness

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:30.050 align:middle line:84%
to who you are, being kind,
and expressing yourself

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.630 align:middle line:90%
in that format?

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:36.830 align:middle line:84%
So there are many, many
who are making a change.

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's not publicized
because there's still

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:48.300 align:middle line:84%
that fear, that underlying
fear, of what has gone before--

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.870 align:middle line:84%
the persecutions,
the non-acceptance.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:59.070 align:middle line:84%
It's very important to
the ego of the individuals

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:01.920 align:middle line:84%
in human form in
that denser state

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:84%
to be accepted by their
community, by their friends,

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.900 align:middle line:90%
by their family.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And they are fearful
of stepping outside

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:14.100 align:middle line:84%
of that, even when
inside, in their heart,

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.260 align:middle line:84%
in that consciousness
of their heart,

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:84%
they know the places
that they need to be,

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:24.420 align:middle line:84%
what they need to
say, and how they

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.960 align:middle line:90%
need to create their lives.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.340 align:middle line:84%
These are the ones that
are making the changes.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean you have
to be a great teacher

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:35.610 align:middle line:84%
with great followings, just that
you have to create your life

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:39.870 align:middle line:90%
experience from that format.

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And in that, you change much of
the collective consciousness.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And time-- just to
go back a moment,

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:58.820 align:middle line:84%
you said that this time for
this change from a denser

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:03.500 align:middle line:84%
reality to lighter reality
is throughout this quadrant

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.116 align:middle line:90%
of the universe at this time?

00:29:05.116 --> 00:29:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Absolutely.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So other
planets and other species

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:10.130 align:middle line:84%
are going through a
similar thing to what we're

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:11.390 align:middle line:90%
going through now?

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Absolutely.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:20.300 align:middle line:84%
You see, this
quadrant of the galaxy

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:25.820 align:middle line:84%
fell to that denser
state of consciousness.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Parts of the universe,
the Milky Way universe,

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:35.030 align:middle line:84%
did not fall to that
denseness, but they did fall

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:41.060 align:middle line:84%
because they were dependent
on the emanations from Earth

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.790 align:middle line:90%
as that Christed vehicle--

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: --to keep them
very centered and aware,

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and it was such a
devastating event

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:59.810 align:middle line:84%
when that happened that the
consciousness of Earth fell.

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:04.010 align:middle line:84%
There was such a thing
as an energetic template

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:08.120 align:middle line:84%
that was within the
Earth energy that

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.910 align:middle line:90%
was called the Christed matrix.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:17.240 align:middle line:10%
And this Christed matrix
emanated vast thought,

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:23.500 align:middle line:10%
vast light, undifferentiated
light, undifferentiated love,

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:29.830 align:middle line:10%
a source, and that's the
vibration that Earth carried.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.590 align:middle line:84%
In that denseness, in
that final cataclysm

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:35.290 align:middle line:84%
at the fall into
third dimension,

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:39.730 align:middle line:84%
that Christed
matrix was removed.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And these planetary systems
in the vaster regions

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.890 align:middle line:84%
of the universe that
were dependent on that

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:51.620 align:middle line:84%
were very limited
in their evolvement

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:56.180 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
have that influence.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:00.530 align:middle line:84%
But they could maintain
a certain level.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:07.820 align:middle line:84%
So these are the ones that,
for those who are aware,

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:13.370 align:middle line:84%
can hear from the
Sirians, the Pleiadians,

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:21.610 align:middle line:84%
many sources that guide the
evolvement of the planet.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:24.680 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But they also need
this planet to recover itself.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Will that energy
that was taken away return?

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Absolutely.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:39.020 align:middle line:84%
In 2011, that Christed matrix
was returned and placed

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:42.070 align:middle line:90%
in the heart of Gaia, of Earth.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:49.570 align:middle line:84%
It was also placed in the
heart of every human that is

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:53.860 align:middle line:90%
in an incarnation at this time.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.270 align:middle line:90%
It was dormant.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:32:01.490 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't vibrating and
emanating that light.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:05.560 align:middle line:84%
But since 2011, there
was great change

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.840 align:middle line:90%
that came about after 2012.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.870 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't what many expected,
that they would wake up

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and everything
would be wonderful.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.630 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.890 align:middle line:90%
You are the creators.

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Every one, every
human, is a creator.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And it is up to them, they
are the ones, in bodies,

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:33.770 align:middle line:84%
in human form, in
a physical form,

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:37.700 align:middle line:84%
that have to uplift
a physical planet.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.950 align:middle line:90%
We can guide you.

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:45.930 align:middle line:84%
We can send you vast
amounts of love and light.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But you are the ones
that create form in form.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.010 align:middle line:84%
So when you change
your thought, you

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:57.180 align:middle line:84%
change the emotions you
use, and you implement that,

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and you create in the day-to-day
life, you alter, substantially,

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:10.900 align:middle line:84%
humans themselves
and Earth itself.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:15.480 align:middle line:84%
So the environment
supports this evolvement.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was told,
not that long ago,

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:22.170 align:middle line:84%
by someone who looks
into these things

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:27.130 align:middle line:84%
that the great crystal that
everything resonated to

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:31.020 align:middle line:84%
in Atlantis before the
loss of that continent

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:35.290 align:middle line:84%
was alive and active, and
that it was still pulsing out

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:36.090 align:middle line:90%
its signal.

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Is there any truth that
that technology from the day

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:46.110 align:middle line:90%
is beginning to reassert itself?

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Absolutely, and
there was more than one.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.558 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: There were several.

00:33:50.558 --> 00:33:53.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that some people
are particularly attuned to it.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Now that said, the
crystalline grid

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:02.740 align:middle line:84%
within the Earth,
the crystalline grid

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:08.590 align:middle line:84%
that you know about, is
a denser configuration.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:18.690 align:middle line:84%
There are two levels below that
that are crystalline in form.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:26.639 align:middle line:84%
The third level is
of that golden age,

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:29.280 align:middle line:90%
and it is still emanating.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is what
I am asking about, yes.

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:34.989 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Yes, it's
like a vast computer.

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:40.380 align:middle line:84%
So what has to happen is this
top layer has to be cleared.

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And the archangelic community
has been charged with that duty

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and enlisted many
who have technology,

00:34:53.190 --> 00:35:01.380 align:middle line:84%
who have remembrances, to
come to the aid of the grid

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.530 align:middle line:84%
and to make great
changes in that grid

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:09.960 align:middle line:84%
so that what is beneath it
can come to the surface.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.090 align:middle line:84%
You know crystals are
used for communication.

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: And they
can be programmed.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:21.420 align:middle line:84%
They absorb as well
as they transmit.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So this grid that it
is at the very top

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.660 align:middle line:84%
is in the process
of being cleared.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: And when that happens,
then more of this communication

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.010 align:middle line:90%
will be able to surface.

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And the archangelics
are protecting it

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:41.730 align:middle line:84%
so that it's not contaminated
by what is on the top.

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, excellent.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
people, many, many

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:47.490 align:middle line:84%
of the people who were
alive at that time

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:48.970 align:middle line:90%
are incarnate back at this time.

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they can start
receiving these signals,

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.460 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, from
the central computer.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you were
to say to someone

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:05.529 align:middle line:84%
how that information
is utilized--

00:36:05.529 --> 00:36:07.320 align:middle line:84%
first of all, what
would you say the nature

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.670 align:middle line:84%
of that information to
that person would be?

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe it's on a
subconscious level, a level

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.817 align:middle line:90%
below our conscious awareness.

00:36:14.817 --> 00:36:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Now you're
speaking of the--

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The crystal
communicating through

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:22.290 align:middle line:84%
this technology back out
again and resurfacing.

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Well, it
is about bringing

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:30.450 align:middle line:84%
the awareness of each
individual that they contribute

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:36.850 align:middle line:84%
to the environment and
who they are as creators.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:39.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, OK, to
reignite that remembrance,

00:36:39.315 --> 00:36:40.115 align:middle line:90%
that knowledge.

00:36:40.115 --> 00:36:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: That remembrance
and the ability

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:46.600 align:middle line:90%
to create precisely.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Clear thought.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Clear thought.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:57.270 align:middle line:84%
So there are many that are
now involved in such things.

00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:02.760 align:middle line:84%
These new beings
coming in since 2012,

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.360 align:middle line:84%
these souls that are
reincarnating now

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:10.470 align:middle line:84%
into physical bodies, come in
at that fifth dimensional level,

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:13.440 align:middle line:90%
no longer at that denser level.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:17.220 align:middle line:90%
So they are brilliant.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:21.200 align:middle line:84%
The generations
coming up are going

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:25.340 align:middle line:84%
to make great
significant changes.

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is due to those beings
who are working so diligently,

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:36.410 align:middle line:84%
and that you think
are in the minority.

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:39.610 align:middle line:84%
But because you think
they are in the minority,

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:42.590 align:middle line:84%
you don't take
into consideration

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:45.260 align:middle line:84%
the emanation of their
collective consciousness

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and the impact that
they have on the world.

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:53.670 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones that--
we tell them always, you

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.950 align:middle line:84%
were the ones in
the trenches, you

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:59.430 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that
lay the foundation

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:02.880 align:middle line:84%
for these beautiful
souls to come in.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Because without
you, they could not

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:09.000 align:middle line:84%
come into such a
dense environment.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.690 align:middle line:84%
You are the ones that are
changing that environment

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:16.260 align:middle line:84%
so they can come in
and do what they do.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:21.560 align:middle line:84%
So these beautiful beings, they
are going to change everything.

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.340 align:middle line:90%
They are starting to.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.430 align:middle line:84%
You are aware in your
educational system

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:30.120 align:middle line:84%
that traditional rote
memorization isn't working.

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.510 align:middle line:84%
These children are
far beyond that.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:36.700 align:middle line:90%
They grasp things so quickly.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Their mind, their neurology, can
process complex thought in ways

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:50.100 align:middle line:84%
that the older
generations were not

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:55.590 align:middle line:84%
without some type of
conscious awareness

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:59.350 align:middle line:84%
and actually working
on developing that.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And there are many out there
doing that now, changing

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:05.590 align:middle line:84%
the neurology of the body,
the physiology of the body.

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:07.030 align:middle line:90%
The body is going to change.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:12.100 align:middle line:84%
It won't be the dense
manifestation that it is today.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And the psychology, all
of that dense programming.

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:19.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not about right
or wrong, beloveds.

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:22.260 align:middle line:90%
It's about denseness.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.740 align:middle line:90%
It's about negativity, fear.

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And you have to walk through
that and into the light.

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And would you say,
along with this,

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:38.480 align:middle line:84%
that the DNA of these young ones
is altered, has been changing?

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yes.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.363 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what's the
commonality of those DNA,

00:39:41.363 --> 00:39:43.260 align:middle line:90%
those genetic changes?

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: They have more
DNA strands fully activated.

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Now that's not to say that those
embodied in form now cannot

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.810 align:middle line:90%
change that DNA structure.

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Your scientific
community only knows

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:05.090 align:middle line:90%
about two specific stands.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:07.850 align:middle line:90%
There are 12.

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And once you activate in through
that fourth, fifth strand,

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:20.960 align:middle line:84%
you begin to realize more who
you are at a conscious level.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Not so much lies
in the unconscious.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:29.480 align:middle line:90%
So you can alter that.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.570 align:middle line:84%
It's been proven in your
scientific community

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:36.440 align:middle line:84%
that you can alter that
DNA structure simply

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:39.290 align:middle line:84%
by what you think on
a consistent basis

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:42.050 align:middle line:90%
and how you use your emotions.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So that includes being conscious
of the thoughts that you think

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.174 align:middle line:90%
and talk to yourself about.

00:40:51.174 --> 00:40:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I think
that is a perfect time

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:55.730 align:middle line:84%
to begin introducing the subject
we had planned on talking

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:58.271 align:middle line:84%
about today, and I want to thank
you very much for everything

00:40:58.271 --> 00:41:00.527 align:middle line:90%
you've added up to this point.

00:41:00.527 --> 00:41:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
talking about the things

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.460 align:middle line:84%
we tell ourselves,
oftentimes, we

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.170 align:middle line:84%
try to be more mindful about
this while in meditation,

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:08.520 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what happens when

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.850 align:middle line:84%
we go into a quiet state
with the specific intention

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:18.260 align:middle line:84%
of trying to reach your realm
or other realms of guidance.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Because many people say,
well, I wish I had a guide.

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:23.990 align:middle line:84%
If I have one, I can't
hear them, and so forth,

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:26.660 align:middle line:84%
and feel lost and alone
when it comes time

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:29.240 align:middle line:84%
to make some of the
tough decisions in life.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.400 align:middle line:84%
So I think the first
question I would

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:35.960 align:middle line:84%
ask you is, how does a person
who has not really explored

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.900 align:middle line:84%
this, but would like
to, begin recognizing

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:43.490 align:middle line:84%
when their guidance
is present to them?

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: It's like developing
a closer relationship

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:52.640 align:middle line:84%
with someone that you
feel very connected to.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:58.710 align:middle line:84%
You spend time, don't you,
communicating with that person?

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:02.270 align:middle line:90%
So it's the same thing here.

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:08.370 align:middle line:84%
If this is your intention,
that's the first step.

00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:12.740 align:middle line:84%
The second step is
paying attention.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.020 align:middle line:90%
This is what Joan was saying.

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: And we will respond.

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, have no preconceived
ideas or beliefs

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:31.990 align:middle line:84%
on how that's going to manifest,
because this communication

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:34.090 align:middle line:84%
takes time to
develop, especially

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:39.880 align:middle line:84%
when it's lied dormant for
many, many, many years for some.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:47.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you provide yourself with
a very quiet environment just

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:54.250 align:middle line:84%
to sit, and with your intention,
call forth your guardian angel,

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:59.290 align:middle line:84%
call forth your guide, and
ask that they be with you

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:00.790 align:middle line:90%
in a more conscious way.

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:03.630 align:middle line:90%


00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:06.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank them for their presence.

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can't just do this
once every few months.

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:19.200 align:middle line:84%
You can't develop a close
relationship with another human

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.320 align:middle line:84%
if you only see them
every six months

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.560 align:middle line:84%
or hear from them
every six months.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:31.650 align:middle line:84%
You have to develop it in
the present moment, not

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:34.830 align:middle line:84%
about any past
experiences, but just

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:36.440 align:middle line:90%
what's in the present moment.

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And you pay attention to the
energy that is developing

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:46.240 align:middle line:90%
around you and within you.

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.470 align:middle line:90%
Feel how that heart feels.

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Open.

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Feel the light
that is within you.

00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:58.120 align:middle line:90%


00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's helpful if
you journal, if you write.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I felt this, I felt a
closeness to an energy that

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:15.740 align:middle line:84%
was very light-filled or very
loving, I felt very loved.

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So start
validating the early feelings

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:19.710 align:middle line:90%
that you're having.

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yes.

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:23.820 align:middle line:90%
This is how you pay attention.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Because once you leave that
very sacred environment

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:33.000 align:middle line:84%
that you've created, and you get
back into your day-to-day life

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.230 align:middle line:84%
where you're bombarded by
multiple, different types

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:41.160 align:middle line:84%
of energy, that
kind of dissipates

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:45.030 align:middle line:84%
until you discipline
yourself to stay

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:48.960 align:middle line:84%
centered, to pay attention,
when you're triggered, when

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.680 align:middle line:90%
you get fearful.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And through this intercession
with your guides at first,

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.700 align:middle line:84%
possibly, you'll call
forth an archangel

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:04.780 align:middle line:84%
or an angel of some
type that comes

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:07.510 align:middle line:90%
to help you in a specific way.

00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:13.770 align:middle line:84%
You might have ideas, or
you might have thoughts

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:15.900 align:middle line:90%
that you've never had before.

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Document that, and then
go back and read it.

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Don't just document it
and throw it in a drawer,

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and six months later,
forget about it.

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Read it.

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:31.291 align:middle line:84%
That's what reinforces
the communication.

00:45:31.291 --> 00:45:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
validates the experience.

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: And it validates
that something is changing.

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:39.700 align:middle line:90%
Be patient.

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
denseness that you

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:49.380 align:middle line:84%
have to sift through and
eliminate as you pay attention.

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.900 align:middle line:90%
What's your self-talk?

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:56.050 align:middle line:84%
What are you thinking when
you're brushing your teeth?

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:58.470 align:middle line:84%
What are you thinking when
you're dressing in the morning?

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:01.120 align:middle line:90%


00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And through the intercession
of these great beings,

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:11.440 align:middle line:84%
you begin to alter
those thoughts,

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:17.050 align:middle line:84%
you begin to have a more
calmness to yourself.

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And when things come up that
you would normally react to,

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.920 align:middle line:90%
you realize you have a choice.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to do that.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.580 align:middle line:90%
And you move on.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:31.510 align:middle line:90%
But this takes time.

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In this
process, when a person

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:38.440 align:middle line:84%
is going to their guides,
say, now, to make a request.

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
nature of request.

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:44.470 align:middle line:84%
There can be requests for,
of course, many reasons,

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:47.740 align:middle line:84%
and some of them
are very beautiful,

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:50.860 align:middle line:84%
and others can be maybe a
little more self-serving.

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Is the presence of that
person's own higher mind or soul

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.940 align:middle line:84%
working in the complex
with this guide

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:01.630 align:middle line:84%
to say, no, we're not
going there exactly,

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:04.360 align:middle line:84%
but we'll take them here, which
will maybe take them slightly

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.870 align:middle line:90%
off but to a better place?

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:08.710 align:middle line:84%
So does the soul, our own
soul, then factor into it?

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yes.

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Very good point to bring up.

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:17.440 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you're giving
too much power to that being.

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, mm-hmm.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: The power is
within each individual.

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:25.330 align:middle line:90%
Your soul has a voice.

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Your soul has a wisdom
of many, many, many times

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:35.440 align:middle line:84%
in which it was in
some type of form.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.490 align:middle line:84%
So there is a wisdom
that it possesses.

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And many times, you're not
even aware of that voice.

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So here is another
part of you that you

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.270 align:middle line:90%
have to become conscious of.

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Some people call that the
descension of spirit into body.

00:47:58.410 --> 00:48:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So as you practice being
centered, calling forth light,

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.660 align:middle line:84%
calling forth love
of the creator,

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.930 align:middle line:84%
you develop an
energetic presence

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:18.020 align:middle line:84%
that is a very
nurturing environment

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:22.880 align:middle line:84%
to begin to receive the
wisdom of your soul.

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And understand that it does
have a presence within you.

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.360 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention.

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Write that down.

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's where
you guys come in handy,

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:38.470 align:middle line:84%
is to help us where we're
not hearing that very

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:40.630 align:middle line:90%
ephemeral whisper of the soul.

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a guide or an archangel
can become more strongly

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:46.510 align:middle line:90%
present to rap us on the head.

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:47.884 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

00:48:47.884 --> 00:48:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it
does have to live

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.700 align:middle line:84%
within the relationship
with the soul

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:55.339 align:middle line:84%
and what the soul says when we
have a request to you, right?

00:48:55.339 --> 00:48:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: That's correct.

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:58.254 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we may
think they didn't answer.

00:48:58.254 --> 00:48:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yes.

00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:05.830 align:middle line:84%
You have come into a
human form for a reason,

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:09.010 align:middle line:84%
and your soul
knows that reasons.

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:09.820 align:middle line:90%
That is you.

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:11.500 align:middle line:90%
Your soul is you.

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not separate from you.

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And it has a wisdom
and a knowledge.

00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:22.070 align:middle line:84%
You have that
wisdom and knowledge

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:25.120 align:middle line:90%
when you can uncover it.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:31.040 align:middle line:90%
It has ownership of your body.

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: You are in charge.

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:38.090 align:middle line:84%
You are the creator
of your reality.

00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And through the intercession
of these beautiful beings,

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:48.380 align:middle line:90%
they are here to show you that.

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:52.490 align:middle line:84%
They are not here to say,
oh, you have to do this,

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:54.740 align:middle line:90%
you have to do that.

00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:56.930 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:49:56.930 --> 00:50:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Your soul, you are
the one in charge.

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is very
important because it's really

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:07.000 align:middle line:84%
where the subject of
free will comes in.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.010 align:middle line:90%
It's so misunderstood.

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yes.

00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Say, I
want to do that,

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just not
making it happen,

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:13.745 align:middle line:84%
all this other
stuff's happening.

00:50:13.745 --> 00:50:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're not acknowledging that
the soul might be playing out

00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:20.710 align:middle line:84%
its own desires
perfectly through us,

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:23.630 align:middle line:84%
we just aren't recognizing
the point in it yet.

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Yes, you're going
in the wrong direction.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: The soul
knows that, and so you,

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:34.690 align:middle line:84%
at an unconscious
level, you create.

00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Let me make that
perfectly clear.

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:43.280 align:middle line:84%
You create, consciously
and unconsciously.

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's so
important to make conscious

00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:50.380 align:middle line:84%
every thought you
think and every feeling

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.800 align:middle line:84%
that you feel in
your emotional body.

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:58.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's no easy thing to do.

00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it takes
a lot of diligence,

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and time, and
practice, as you say.

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So if you are veering off
in a creative area that

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:12.470 align:middle line:84%
does not serve you
at a soul level,

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:15.440 align:middle line:90%
you will not allow yourself--

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:20.390 align:middle line:84%
understand this-- you will not
allow yourself to manifest it.

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:23.990 align:middle line:84%
You will put
obstacles in your way.

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:26.090 align:middle line:90%
No one else puts those there.

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:27.330 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then people
say, my guides didn't hear me,

00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:31.490 align:middle line:84%
they're not giving
me what I want.

00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:33.740 align:middle line:84%
That's why I wanted to
bring up this notion

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:35.580 align:middle line:90%
that it is the soul in charge.

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:36.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:38.037 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you're assisting--

00:51:38.037 --> 00:51:40.370 align:middle line:84%
working with the soul to
assist the human consciousness.

00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:41.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Most definitely.

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and that's
a beautiful relationship.

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be very
frustrating at times

00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:50.330 align:middle line:84%
because the will of the
conscious mind, quote,

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:52.910 align:middle line:84%
"conscious mind," wants
one thing so badly,

00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:55.980 align:middle line:84%
and they're just having
a tantrum on one hand.

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But the soul is saying, no, no,
no, don't help them with that.

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.560 align:middle line:90%
This is not where we're going.

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: No, no, it's not.

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:08.990 align:middle line:84%
That obstacle may show up as
an individual in your life

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:13.890 align:middle line:84%
that is there for the sole
purpose of being that obstacle.

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Or on the other hand,
you may come across someone,

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:25.280 align:middle line:84%
or you may meet someone, that
is there to show you something.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:29.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not what they say,
but it's just who they are.

00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And they mirror to
you a certain path.

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: So there's
much at work.

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:44.720 align:middle line:84%
The soul is a very powerful,
powerful part of you.

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So creative.

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: So creative.

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to you to become
more fully aware of it,

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:54.350 align:middle line:84%
of that part of
you, who you are.

00:52:54.350 --> 00:52:59.670 align:middle line:84%
This is the part that we call
to your attention as the divine.

00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:03.200 align:middle line:84%
This is who you are
at that divine level.

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Every being who is incarnated
in a body at this time on planet

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:12.260 align:middle line:90%
Earth is divine.

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Make no mistake about that.

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:16.160 align:middle line:84%
You may not agree with
what they're doing,

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:20.660 align:middle line:84%
or how they're creating their
environment or their life,

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:24.440 align:middle line:84%
but at the core of
that individual,

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.262 align:middle line:90%
they are a divine creator.

00:53:27.262 --> 00:53:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:32.190 align:middle line:84%
That's always good to be
reminded for each of us.

00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what happens when--

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:37.860 align:middle line:84%
we hear of these situations
that our guides aren't

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:40.290 align:middle line:90%
allowed to really interfere.

00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:42.910 align:middle line:84%
There needs to be a
request of some kind,

00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:45.690 align:middle line:84%
whether it's from our conscious
mind or from the soul.

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:50.080 align:middle line:84%
But what about those times when
extraordinary things happen,

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.300 align:middle line:90%
and they happen very quickly.

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And we hear the tales of
someone flying through the air,

00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:56.850 align:middle line:90%
and they land softly--

00:53:56.850 --> 00:54:00.060 align:middle line:84%
no broken bones in a
car wreck, for example.

00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how you
guys work from that level

00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:07.480 align:middle line:90%
to alter physical reality here.

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Well, of course.

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Your guardian angels do
that on many occasions.

00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever
slipped and fallen,

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and you just got up
and shake yourself off?

00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:20.400 align:middle line:90%
The body is perfectly OK?

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:23.850 align:middle line:84%
That's what a guardian
angel is to help you do.

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Not only to provide that
loving, light-filled environment

00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:36.090 align:middle line:84%
for your soul to
be fully present,

00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:43.890 align:middle line:84%
but they're here to interfere
at times when it is important

00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:48.330 align:middle line:84%
that the body survive
in health and well-being

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:50.910 align:middle line:84%
because you have a
specific purpose that

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:53.050 align:middle line:90%
has not been accomplished yet.

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
can bend the laws

00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:56.056 align:middle line:90%
of what we call physics here.

00:54:56.056 --> 00:54:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Physics, exactly.

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.770 align:middle line:90%
There are no limitations.

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Time-space is just
an environment

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:08.030 align:middle line:84%
to experiment and to experience
certain levels of yourself.

00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:12.420 align:middle line:84%
So when you need
to come in, if it's

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:14.850 align:middle line:84%
in the best interest of
that soul and person,

00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:15.934 align:middle line:90%
you don't need permission.

00:55:15.934 --> 00:55:18.016 align:middle line:84%
You can come in, and scoop
them up, and help them,

00:55:18.016 --> 00:55:19.330 align:middle line:90%
and get them out of harm's way.

00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Correct.

00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:22.671 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is happening
in subtle ways, I understand,

00:55:22.671 --> 00:55:24.570 align:middle line:84%
all the time, maybe
even driving down

00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:27.180 align:middle line:84%
the road when we're
texting, keeping us out

00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:30.990 align:middle line:84%
of horrid accidents by
the millions each day.

00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:33.750 align:middle line:84%
How is the world
of guidance working

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:37.785 align:middle line:84%
with people talking on cell
phones while they're driving?

00:55:37.785 --> 00:55:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:42.300 align:middle line:84%
But that carries over
into other levels.

00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:47.940 align:middle line:84%
When you are ready to make a
decision that would lead you

00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:55.980 align:middle line:84%
in harm's way or cause you to
fall into a level of negativity

00:55:55.980 --> 00:56:03.210 align:middle line:84%
that is not really in coherence
with your soul purpose

00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:09.000 align:middle line:84%
at that particular
juncture of its presence,

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:16.140 align:middle line:84%
then there is an
unconscious invocation

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:22.290 align:middle line:84%
given to either a guide,
a master being, an angel,

00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:26.790 align:middle line:90%
an archangel, to interfere.

00:56:26.790 --> 00:56:30.300 align:middle line:84%
You have given permission,
permission now,

00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:35.500 align:middle line:84%
at a soul level for
that interference.

00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I thank
you for making that statement

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.740 align:middle line:84%
because, again, this is
another subject that's

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:43.330 align:middle line:90%
very confused on this planet.

00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Another one that we might even
say is in the area of mischief,

00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:51.030 align:middle line:84%
and that is working
beyond the laws of physics

00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:53.400 align:middle line:84%
in this dimension can
be very frustrating.

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes,
things almost seem

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.630 align:middle line:84%
to blink in and
out of existence.

00:56:57.630 --> 00:57:00.040 align:middle line:84%
We know we put it
there, it's gone,

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:03.120 align:middle line:84%
and then it just shows up a day
or two in the same spot later.

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Some people say there
are naughty fairies doing

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:06.270 align:middle line:90%
these things.

00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:08.130 align:middle line:84%
I've had this
happen quite a bit.

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:09.960 align:middle line:84%
But what's actually
going on there

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:13.110 align:middle line:84%
when our physical items simply
blink out and then blink back

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:14.400 align:middle line:90%
in?

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Well, there's
a dimensional shift

00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:19.740 align:middle line:84%
that has occurred for
a reason, a purpose.

00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:23.280 align:middle line:84%
It has a purpose, and maybe
it's to draw your attention

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:28.330 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps you are more
than what you think you are,

00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:32.640 align:middle line:84%
that you operate in
multidimensional frequencies

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:33.840 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: So it's not about
questioning why or how, it's

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:43.880 align:middle line:90%
about noticing.

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And each dimension
has a frequency range.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you are really
invested in a denser dimension,

00:57:57.710 --> 00:58:00.680 align:middle line:90%
you cannot see beyond that.

00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.930 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
mean at a soul level

00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:06.110 align:middle line:84%
that you don't
fluctuate, and navigate

00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:08.150 align:middle line:90%
in and out of those existences.

00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:09.680 align:middle line:90%
So perhaps--

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're just
trying to get your attention.

00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps you shifted into
another dimensional frequency

00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:22.220 align:middle line:84%
wavelength, and you
moved that article

00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:25.710 align:middle line:90%
into that dimensional frequency.

00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:29.540 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, when
you are more centered,

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:35.360 align:middle line:84%
and your attention is placed
in that denser reality,

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:39.986 align:middle line:84%
it no longer exists
because you moved it.

00:58:39.986 --> 00:58:40.834 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:58:40.834 --> 00:58:42.500 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple
of things I think of,

00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:44.930 align:middle line:84%
just one small
example, because I know

00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:46.527 align:middle line:90%
most people can relate to this.

00:58:46.527 --> 00:58:48.110 align:middle line:84%
They've had these
silly things happen,

00:58:48.110 --> 00:58:52.910 align:middle line:84%
where I was in the office here,
a gold earring fell off my ear.

00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:53.740 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't find it.

00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:55.430 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't find it anywhere.

00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:57.370 align:middle line:84%
About four to six
months later, I

00:58:57.370 --> 00:59:00.190 align:middle line:84%
came in the office, which
was vacuumed every day,

00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and there it is in the middle
of the floor, a gold earring,

00:59:03.930 --> 00:59:05.180 align:middle line:90%
remanifest.

00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: What did
you learn from that?

00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't-- to be
perfectly honest, I thought,

00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:15.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, it has disappeared
somewhere, and it's reappeared.

00:59:15.050 --> 00:59:18.410 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't understand
why that had to happen.

00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:20.300 align:middle line:84%
I accept pretty
easily when things--

00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:23.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't make a fuss too much
if things disappear now.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.220 align:middle line:84%
I figure there's
a reason, there's

00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:27.140 align:middle line:84%
something I'm supposed
to notice in it.

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:29.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's usually silly
things like that.

00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And I've never been able to
have real coherence around why

00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:36.890 align:middle line:84%
things have to disappear
and reappear again.

00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: At a
simplistic viewpoint,

00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:44.360 align:middle line:84%
it's showing you what
level of non-attachment

00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:46.590 align:middle line:84%
to physical things
that you have.

00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the only lesson
I've been able to take from it,

00:59:49.770 --> 00:59:51.680 align:middle line:84%
is, OK, your gold
earring's gone.

00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:53.050 align:middle line:90%
You can get another.

00:59:53.050 --> 00:59:53.850 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:54.990 align:middle line:90%
I went and got another.

00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And there it appears
after I was let go

00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:58.791 align:middle line:84%
and just got another,
let go, period.

00:59:58.791 --> 01:00:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And you're right, that is the
only thing that's come to mind

01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:03.510 align:middle line:84%
is, well, I guess I
need to not be attached.

01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: So eventually,
that teaches you

01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:09.570 align:middle line:84%
that all things
physical are transient.

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's very
good, very good lesson.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.900 align:middle line:84%
It seems just like silly
hijinks and an inconvenience,

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.820 align:middle line:90%
but it is a good lesson.

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: So these
are the things

01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that you should
pay attention to.

01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: What did
you learn from this?

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So you've had a traumatic
event happen in your life.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:35.460 align:middle line:84%
You aren't going to understand
every nuance of that.

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:38.930 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, if you
will pay attention,

01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:40.820 align:middle line:90%
what did you learn about that?

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:46.220 align:middle line:84%
How did that shift the course
of your life and the choices

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:47.360 align:middle line:90%
that you are making?

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And this, I think, a
lot of people watching

01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:53.960 align:middle line:84%
have learned, that
trauma is usually there

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.550 align:middle line:90%
to teach us something.

01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:59.870 align:middle line:84%
To make your
consciousness flower.

01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:05.450 align:middle line:84%
So on this subject,
we've had so much fun.

01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:08.600 align:middle line:84%
We're running out of time
here in this dimension.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.400 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
further you'd like

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.940 align:middle line:84%
to share with us about this
relationship, which you've

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:15.230 align:middle line:90%
told us the beginning of it?

01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Ask, pay attention, write
down what you're feeling,

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.480 align:middle line:84%
anything happening
in your body, start

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:26.720 align:middle line:84%
going into a very direct
companionship with your guides

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.900 align:middle line:90%
and your soul, in particular.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Know that the soul is
ultimately in charge.

01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:33.999 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not having
your wishes answered

01:01:33.999 --> 01:01:36.290 align:middle line:84%
in the way you wish, it's
because it's not in your best

01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:37.410 align:middle line:90%
interest most of the time.

01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Correct.

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:39.876 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now what
else can we take away

01:01:39.876 --> 01:01:41.600 align:middle line:84%
from this part of
the conversation

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and working with
these splendid beings?

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: The most important
thing is using your senses.

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:50.510 align:middle line:90%


01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:55.100 align:middle line:84%
The connection that
you have with us,

01:01:55.100 --> 01:02:00.080 align:middle line:84%
with your guides
or beings of light,

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.450 align:middle line:84%
is never a subservient
relationship.

01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: You are
not the victim.

01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:09.740 align:middle line:90%
They are not in charge.

01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.210 align:middle line:90%
You are.

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:15.650 align:middle line:84%
If at any time, the
energy, this teaches

01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:21.950 align:middle line:84%
you to be very discerning
about the energetic environment

01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:24.800 align:middle line:90%
that you have created.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Have you drawn in a
jokester or a negative being

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:36.200 align:middle line:84%
that sees your beloved light
and would you like some of that?

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, discernment.

01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Discernment.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So understand, you
are always in charge.

01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:45.510 align:middle line:90%
You own your physical body.

01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And if ever, ever that being
brings in your thoughts

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.560 align:middle line:84%
things that are negative, or
that make you subservient,

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:05.530 align:middle line:84%
or the energy doesn't feel
right to you, dismiss it.

01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Leave.

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Command
that they leave.

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.560 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.164 align:middle line:90%
This is most important.

01:03:17.164 --> 01:03:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Learning
discernment if you're

01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:21.150 align:middle line:84%
going to start engaging
consciously with other realms.

01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Because
there are other spirits

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:28.710 align:middle line:84%
out there in the spirit
world who have not

01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:31.750 align:middle line:90%
learned about love yet.

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:38.640 align:middle line:84%
On that note, it's very
lovely to speak to you again.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.370 align:middle line:84%
It's been a few years--
well, at least in this way.

01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you so much for
joining us today and helping

01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:45.520 align:middle line:90%
clarify some of these things.

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And with that, I wish you well,
and we'll let Joan come back,

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.080 align:middle line:90%
and then say goodbye.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: You're very welcome.

01:03:53.940 --> 01:04:01.840 align:middle line:84%
I am honored to be present
and be a voice of change.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:02.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

01:04:02.755 --> 01:04:03.745 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Blessings.

01:04:03.745 --> 01:04:20.090 align:middle line:90%


01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Welcome back.

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Hello.

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hi.

01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Wow, the energy in the
room took such a big shift.

01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:27.440 align:middle line:90%
Goodness gracious.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I feel like my head's
about to lift off,

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and the ringing, and all
the sounds, and everything.

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:34.722 align:middle line:90%
But, Joan, we are out of time.

01:04:34.722 --> 01:04:35.930 align:middle line:90%
We had so much to talk about.

01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:38.630 align:middle line:84%
But what I do want
to talk about is you

01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:41.470 align:middle line:84%
yourself are teaching
these lovely courses now.

01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:44.300 align:middle line:90%
They go on for months at a time.

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Give just a quick synopsis
of what you're teaching.

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:53.030 align:middle line:10%
>>WALKER: We are teaching
self-awareness, consciousness.

01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:56.510 align:middle line:90%


01:04:56.510 --> 01:05:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Our courses are called
Seating the Divine Image.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:06.530 align:middle line:84%
It's all about you and
becoming aware of the fullness

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:08.180 align:middle line:90%
of who you are.

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:09.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
it's designed for.

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to
say that we offer, once

01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:15.830 align:middle line:84%
a month, a free
teleconference to anyone

01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:20.430 align:middle line:84%
who would like to call in, and
it's called Ask the Archangels.

01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And an archangel,
every month, is

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:28.400 align:middle line:84%
present to give a
short little teaching.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And then it is
opened up to anyone

01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:38.540 align:middle line:84%
on the line who would like to
ask the archangel a question.

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:41.060 align:middle line:84%
We don't take
personal questions,

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:44.900 align:middle line:84%
but relating to the
topic for discussion.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:47.030 align:middle line:84%
How does that
apply to your life?

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:48.650 align:middle line:90%
So this is free to anyone.

01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:52.910 align:middle line:10%
And you can go on our website,
joanandjohnwalker.com,

01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:56.240 align:middle line:10%
and sign up.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:00.440 align:middle line:84%
It's posted every month in our
newsletter and on the web site.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's a service
to whomever has an interest.

01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:04.278 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Whoever would like.

01:06:04.278 --> 01:06:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And it just is a
good format to start

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:12.540 align:middle line:84%
instigating that communication
with an archangel.

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.455 align:middle line:90%
And they love it.

01:06:14.455 --> 01:06:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
they're here to serve.

01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Exactly.

01:06:17.090 --> 01:06:17.525 align:middle line:90%
They love humans.

01:06:17.525 --> 01:06:18.358 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We forget.

01:06:18.358 --> 01:06:21.230 align:middle line:84%
We always want to bow
and feel less than,

01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:23.000 align:middle line:90%
and they're saying, no, no, no.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:23.945 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: No, no.

01:06:23.945 --> 01:06:24.745 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

01:06:24.745 --> 01:06:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what you
want, we'll help.

01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:28.070 align:middle line:90%
Joan, thank you so much.

01:06:28.070 --> 01:06:28.560 align:middle line:90%
It's lovely to see you again.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:29.768 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: You are so welcome.

01:06:29.768 --> 01:06:31.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm delighted.

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.140 align:middle line:10%
