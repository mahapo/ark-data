>>REGINA MEREDITH:
You may not be aware,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.480 align:middle line:10%
but medically
induced comas are now

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.820 align:middle line:10%
a common way of dealing
with the tough cases

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.040 align:middle line:10%
that medical staff
don't have the time

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.020 align:middle line:10%
to deal with once a person
is in critical shape.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.260 align:middle line:84%
This was exacerbated by
COVID and intubation.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.140 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
the medical industry

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.850 align:middle line:84%
has no idea of what that person
is actually experiencing.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Alan Pearce became alarmed
at this growing problem

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and dove into coma
research and where one

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.460 align:middle line:90%
goes when they're lying there.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much
for being with us today.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.225 align:middle line:84%
>>ALAN PEARCE: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:53.110 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Your book is called
"Coma," aptly, of course.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.020 align:middle line:10%
And so before we get into the
subject of comas themselves,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.240 align:middle line:10%
what is it that alerted you?

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.560 align:middle line:84%
What happened that made you
dive into this particular topic,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.840 align:middle line:90%
as a very seasoned journalist?

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Well, it was COVID.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.550 align:middle line:10%
I think, like a lot of people,
we had time on our hands.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.550 align:middle line:10%
I was watching more TV news
than was healthy for me.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.590 align:middle line:10%
And I started to wonder why so
many people around the world

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.690 align:middle line:10%
were being placed into medically
induced comas with COVID.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to know,
how does that work?

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Must be a good thing.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to
wonder, what would they

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.390 align:middle line:90%
experience within their coma?

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.070 align:middle line:90%
So I just started researching.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.760 align:middle line:10%
And the straight answer is that
a coma is an essential tool

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.500 align:middle line:10%
in critical care, has been
for the last 50 years,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.710 align:middle line:10%
and it enables a deeper,
restorative form of sleep that

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.590 align:middle line:10%
enables the medication and
nature to do their job,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.360 align:middle line:10%
and that within a coma, it
should be an utter blank.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.940 align:middle line:84%
It didn't take me long to find
out that none of that is true.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not so.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And so, people were being put
in medically induced comas right

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and left during COVID, because
so many people were intubated.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And we've all heard the
story of intubation.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.060 align:middle line:84%
A lot of those
people don't make it.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, the thing is
that most doctors and nurses

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.380 align:middle line:84%
wholeheartedly believe that
a patient on a mechanical

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:84%
ventilator must be knocked
unconscious because it's just

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:84%
too an appalling an
experience that they--

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because of having
this down their throat,

00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:19.430 align:middle line:84%
that it would be too painful
and their body would start

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.830 align:middle line:84%
trying to reject it if
they were conscious?

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: That's the theory.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:84%
However, there are doctors and
nurses that do put people--

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.660 align:middle line:84%
they do knock them out, but
for like 10, 20 minutes.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And they tell them ahead of
time what they're going to do.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And then they bring
them out gently.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And they adjust to
it in the same way

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.237 align:middle line:84%
that you and I never
think about our breathing

00:02:38.237 --> 00:02:39.470 align:middle line:90%
on a day-to-day basis.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.900 align:middle line:84%
When you come out of your
coma, when you come out

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.680 align:middle line:84%
of this induced coma, you are
conscious of your breathing.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And the simple thing to
do is just calm someone

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.210 align:middle line:90%
down, distract them.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And then automatically, the
mind will just take over.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes an
automatic process.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.490 align:middle line:90%
And people can get on.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.450 align:middle line:90%
They can watch TV.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.490 align:middle line:84%
They can run a business
on their laptop.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:84%
They can text doctors and
nurses on their phone.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: While being intubated?

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.687 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, indeed.

00:03:03.687 --> 00:03:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is you
can get them up and walk them

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.520 align:middle line:84%
around, because it turns out
that the immobility that people

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:84%
experience within a coma
for months at a time

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.100 align:middle line:90%
is really lethal.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.720 align:middle line:84%
The damage that it's caused--
just one week of bed rest has

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.730 align:middle line:90%
proven to cause 40%--

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.080 align:middle line:90%
four zero-- of muscle loss.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you've been in a
coma for, say, two months,

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.030 align:middle line:84%
well, your diaphragm
muscles are not working.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Your heart muscles
are not working.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.740 align:middle line:84%
You can't swallow because all
your throat muscles are not

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.540 align:middle line:90%
working.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.900 align:middle line:84%
You need an awful
lot of aftercare.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you hadn't
put somebody into a coma

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.860 align:middle line:84%
for so long, they can walk out
of that intensive care unit

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.580 align:middle line:84%
and not be pushed to facilities
further and further down

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.510 align:middle line:90%
the line and have ruined lives.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:90%
They never get well again.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.733 align:middle line:90%
They never get well again.

00:03:47.733 --> 00:03:48.533 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:48.533 --> 00:03:49.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So this really took you
down a different road

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
than you were expecting because
you were just researching

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.960 align:middle line:84%
the instance of
coma, intubation,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and blah, blah, blah,
and then finding out now,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:84%
as you go deeper, where
people actually go.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.480 align:middle line:90%
You did a lot of case studies.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:84%
We're going to bring some
up that are quite dramatic.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And it took you into the
realm of consciousness,

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.250 align:middle line:84%
parallel realities,
reincarnation.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.962 align:middle line:84%
It took you all kinds of places
you weren't planning on going.

00:04:15.962 --> 00:04:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: No, I wasn't.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.878 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that no
doctor understands it.

00:04:18.878 --> 00:04:19.678 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:04:19.678 --> 00:04:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: So when people
try and talk about it,

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.770 align:middle line:90%
they're dismissed.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.810 align:middle line:84%
They're told they've
had a false memory.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.760 align:middle line:90%
And it makes them crazy.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.395 align:middle line:84%
And they already
think they've gone mad

00:04:28.395 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:84%
because they've
experienced things that

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.548 align:middle line:90%
are beyond the imagination.

00:04:31.548 --> 00:04:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So when a doctor says,
you've had a false memory,

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.830 align:middle line:84%
or, you hallucinated, it
makes no sense to them.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.730 align:middle line:84%
They have no satisfaction, that
they're just left confused,

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:41.530 align:middle line:90%
utterly confused.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, it creates
a cognitive dissonance

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.720 align:middle line:84%
that can't ever be repaired,
really, because they know it.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:90%
They lived it.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of people
watching, myself included,

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.120 align:middle line:84%
have known people and been
sitting beside people who are

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.930 align:middle line:90%
in comas for various reasons.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.780 align:middle line:90%
And my own mother was in a coma.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.105 align:middle line:84%
And she was not
intubated because they

00:05:00.105 --> 00:05:01.730 align:middle line:84%
knew she wouldn't
make it, ultimately--

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.420 align:middle line:90%
an aneurysm at the brain stem.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:90%
But she lived 11 days.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'd watch how the
involuntary movements happen.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like they're
stretching and waking up,

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:84%
but they're not, which freaks
everyone out and gives you

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:84%
tears of hope only to
find out it's involuntary.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:90%
But I wondered.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.840 align:middle line:84%
I kept wondering,
and ultimately did

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.670 align:middle line:84%
connect with her
outside of her body.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And she was telling me things
that turned out to be accurate.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.675 align:middle line:90%
She was there.

00:05:29.675 --> 00:05:31.300 align:middle line:84%
I just had to go into
a different realm

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.670 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with her.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:84%
She was watching us, but
not in the way we think.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.133 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into that
part of the story.

00:05:38.133 --> 00:05:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well,
many times, people

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:84%
have told me that they're
outside of their body.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I saw
her outside her body.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.002 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: They will
find themselves looking

00:05:45.002 --> 00:05:48.550 align:middle line:84%
at their body, not even
confused by it, necessarily,

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.590 align:middle line:90%
somehow accepting it.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes if you're
on the operating table

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and the doctors think
you're out cold,

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and you're aware of everything
that's happening to you--

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.100 align:middle line:84%
you may not necessarily
feel the pain,

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.470 align:middle line:84%
but you're aware of everything
that's happening to you.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And doctors and nurses
don't accept that.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And they don't accept
it within a coma.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And some people
within a coma, they're

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.900 align:middle line:84%
aware of everything that's
happening around them.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of "locked
in" syndrome.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Doctors and nurses will discuss
their case in front of them,

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.498 align:middle line:84%
say things like, "I don't
think she's going to survive

00:06:19.498 --> 00:06:20.540 align:middle line:90%
the night," and whatever.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.520 align:middle line:90%
And they can hear this.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.460 align:middle line:90%
This is horrifying.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.570 align:middle line:90%
They should never be doing that.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why it's
so important that you're

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:84%
talking about this
because there really

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:27.977 align:middle line:90%
isn't much out there on this.

00:06:27.977 --> 00:06:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: There's nothing.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: We are the first
people to explore this.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.383 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
happening all the time.

00:06:32.383 --> 00:06:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Many people, even
the elderly, who

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.080 align:middle line:84%
often slip into a
coma for a few days

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.660 align:middle line:84%
before they die-- it's so
important to know they're

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.040 align:middle line:84%
right there with you
for the most part.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.160 align:middle line:84%
But there are
circumstances where

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.432 align:middle line:90%
they can be elsewhere, too.

00:06:44.432 --> 00:06:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, there's
different levels.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not as if there's a
one-size-fits-all coma tablet.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And the medication
they give people

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.560 align:middle line:84%
has different effects
on different people.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.500 align:middle line:84%
So some people may be
just hovering there

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.120 align:middle line:84%
beneath the surface, aware
of everything around them,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.240 align:middle line:90%
but unable to blink or scream.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Others just find
themselves in darkness,

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.160 align:middle line:84%
like a mind in darkness not
knowing what's happening.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.530 align:middle line:84%
One girl, she was
14 at the time.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And she kept thinking,
when's my mummy going to come

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:90%
and wake me up?

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:12.960 align:middle line:90%
When's mummy going to come?

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And she was stuck like that
for what felt like an eternity.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Other people go off
to alternate lives.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.150 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, you may be
in hospital for two weeks.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're experiencing an
alternate life spanning decades.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:84%
When I say experiencing,
I mean minute by minute,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.470 align:middle line:90%
actually having a full life--

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.740 align:middle line:84%
holding down jobs, having
kids, getting married, going

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:90%
on vacation.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
get into a very specific one

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.020 align:middle line:84%
of those, which is
absolutely fascinating.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And we have time to let you
tell us the whole story.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.970 align:middle line:90%
His name is Nick McDonald.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, Nick McDonald.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Others are having what appear
to be near-death experiences.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.370 align:middle line:90%
Let's cover that first.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well,
near-death experiences,

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.250 align:middle line:84%
as most people believe,
it is a beautiful thing.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.035 align:middle line:84%
You may be in a
bucolic landscape.

00:07:59.035 --> 00:08:00.660 align:middle line:84%
You may be meeting
your dead relatives.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.780 align:middle line:84%
You may be feeling
more at peace,

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.070 align:middle line:84%
more comfortable than you've
ever felt in your life.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.630 align:middle line:84%
For sure, people within a coma
have recounted that to me.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Others recount a
really dark side.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.990 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's a near-death
experience of sorts.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.850 align:middle line:84%
But people find themselves
trapped in other worlds.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:23.100 align:middle line:84%
For example, one guy, James,
was forced to watch his wife--

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.960 align:middle line:84%
and he's not even
married in this world--

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.782 align:middle line:84%
watching his wife dying in
childbirth over and over again.

00:08:28.782 --> 00:08:30.740 align:middle line:84%
He's in the room and he
has to keep watching it

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.480 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.669 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, when they
try and bring somebody out

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.630 align:middle line:90%
of a coma, they reduce the meds.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And when they come out, they
come out biting and fighting,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.000 align:middle line:84%
desperate to cling
on to this world

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.809 align:middle line:90%
and not go back to that world.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:45.647 align:middle line:84%
When they do that, doctors
consider them agitated and they

00:08:45.647 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:90%
turn back up the medicine.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And they push them
straight back.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.882 align:middle line:84%
So someone like James
will go straight back

00:08:49.882 --> 00:08:52.910 align:middle line:84%
to watch his wife
trapped and dying

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.330 align:middle line:84%
in childbirth over and
over and over again.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.720 align:middle line:84%
He's stuck there,
cannot get out of that.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.980 align:middle line:90%
That's one example.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well so, really, what
you're-- some viewers might be

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.200 align:middle line:84%
saying it's as though they're
dropping into parallel

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:90%
realities.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, the more we go into quantum
physics and the understanding

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and nature of time
essentially being non-linear--

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:90%
space isn't what we think it is.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.660 align:middle line:84%
When we start going
that direction

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.730 align:middle line:84%
and start opening
up to the notion

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:28.380 align:middle line:84%
that we may be living parallel
lives simultaneously from past,

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:90%
future, and present--

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, thanks to the
research into quantum science,

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.890 align:middle line:84%
we can now take these
things seriously.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.515 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Because
before that, it

00:09:36.515 --> 00:09:39.920 align:middle line:84%
was all dismissed as a
delusion, the product of a,

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, a drugged-up
mind or whatever.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.740 align:middle line:90%
But they're not.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.420 align:middle line:84%
People are really
going to places.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And they're going places where
the mystics and the gurus

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and the shaman have always been
going and always sought to go.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And the stories that
they come back with

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.360 align:middle line:84%
are the stories coma
survivors are telling me.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.830 align:middle line:84%
They're going to heaven,
they're going to hell,

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
points in between.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And they are experiencing
alternate lives.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm of the opinion
that these are past lives

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.280 align:middle line:90%
that they're recounting.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they recount
an entire life.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: All the details.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people would list
not so much an alternate life,

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.220 align:middle line:90%
but alternate deaths--

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.000 align:middle line:84%
one after another after
another, sometimes

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.280 align:middle line:90%
with themes such as drowning.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:84%
James, who I
mentioned earlier, he

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:84%
had a series of deaths
involving water.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:84%
He was a Spitfire fighter
pilot in World War II.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.840 align:middle line:84%
He crashed his plane into
the Thames and drowned.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:84%
He was a fisherman
unloading fish in a dock.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.290 align:middle line:84%
He had an accident, fell
in the water, drowned.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Another time, he was placed
in a metal box as a torture.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.510 align:middle line:90%
It was filled with water.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.310 align:middle line:90%
He drowned.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And he could just go on and
on and on listing these.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so when
he came out of his coma,

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.910 align:middle line:90%
he started sharing this?

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: No.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:90%
No one likes to share this.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:54.582 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:54.582 --> 00:10:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So how did James, as one person,
ultimately end up sharing this?

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Because I
got to know James.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.700 align:middle line:90%
I spent time with James.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.460 align:middle line:84%
We got confident
with each other,

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.630 align:middle line:90%
comfortable with each other.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:90%
And he opened up to me.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Most people who've
come out of a coma

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and had these
experiences honestly

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:90%
believe they've gone mad.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.120 align:middle line:90%
Almost everyone.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.950 align:middle line:84%
We've had 20-plus people helping
us specifically working with

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:19.770 align:middle line:90%
the book.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Only two never said
they went mad, had

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.130 align:middle line:90%
thought they'd gone mad.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And
there's no answers.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.210 align:middle line:90%
There is no answer.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I find some people on, say,
Facebook coma survivor groups,

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.920 align:middle line:84%
they are aware that
they're not alone.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.670 align:middle line:84%
But not everybody is lucky
enough to find these groups.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:39.700 align:middle line:90%
And they are alone.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And if they talk to their
family and they say,

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.930 align:middle line:84%
I had an alternate
life spanning decades,

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.180 align:middle line:84%
they're going to say to
them, but hold on, dear.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.730 align:middle line:84%
You were drugged up to the
eyeballs until recently.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:49.630 align:middle line:90%
What do you expect?

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.920 align:middle line:84%
There's no drug or
cocktail of drugs

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.020 align:middle line:84%
that anyone knows
of that can give you

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.360 align:middle line:84%
an alternate life spanning
decades, because if there were,

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.800 align:middle line:90%
we would all know about it.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's go into Nick
McDonald's life on Earth

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.930 align:middle line:90%
before the coma.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how he ended up
in the coma, how long the coma

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.240 align:middle line:84%
lasted, and most
importantly, the life he

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.700 align:middle line:84%
was living while he
was supposedly nowhere.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Nick had a fairly normal
life, as lives go.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.170 align:middle line:84%
He owns and operates
his own pizza parlor.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:26.733 align:middle line:84%
And he contracted pneumonia
and went into hospital.

00:12:26.733 --> 00:12:28.775 align:middle line:84%
That turned to sepsis,
which is really dangerous.

00:12:28.775 --> 00:12:31.020 align:middle line:84%
That leads to organ failure
if you're not careful.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.645 align:middle line:84%
And so they placed
him-- what they

00:12:32.645 --> 00:12:34.770 align:middle line:84%
thought was the best thing
they could possibly do--

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:36.490 align:middle line:90%
into a medically induced coma.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.940 align:middle line:90%
He was there for two weeks.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.780 align:middle line:84%
During that time, he experienced
a whole other life set

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:47.140 align:middle line:84%
in the 1960s and the 1970s
in America's Midwest.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.370 align:middle line:84%
At one point, he was
called up to join

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:54.670 align:middle line:84%
the US Army to go and fight an
alternate Southeast Asian War.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And when I talked to him
about this, the detail

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:84%
he would come up with--
it rained all the time.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.590 align:middle line:84%
He was always wet, whether he
was on patrol or in a trench.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And he says his fingers
were always wrinkly,

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.070 align:middle line:90%
his toes were always wrinkly.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:07.590 align:middle line:90%
And this obsessed him.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's the kind of detail
that you just don't make up.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he was somewhere
in Southeast Asia, apparently.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.150 align:middle line:84%
He said it was wasn't
Vietnam, but it was likely--

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
somewhere around there.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And it
was that scenario.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.455 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, his
tour of duty was up.

00:13:19.455 --> 00:13:20.580 align:middle line:90%
He goes back to the States.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And he lives a really
kind of madcap life.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.760 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't settle down.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And he has a range of
different girlfriends

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.280 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.830 align:middle line:90%
And he has different jobs.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:84%
He's interested in food, import,
exporting, and things like this,

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.350 align:middle line:90%
within his coma world.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.958 align:middle line:84%
And eventually he settles
down to life in a small town.

00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.125 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In his coma world?

00:13:40.125 --> 00:13:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: In his coma world.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, he believes
in his coma world,

00:13:42.315 --> 00:13:43.390 align:middle line:90%
he's been in combat.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.800 align:middle line:90%
He's had frostbitten toes also.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Oh, yes.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where'd they
come from, in the jungle?

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: No, no, because--

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:49.605 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He had to
experience them somewhere.

00:13:49.605 --> 00:13:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: --he worked
outside with his hands.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.230 align:middle line:90%
This is the thing about Nick.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.120 align:middle line:84%
He was what you call a
really skilled handyman.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Show him anything mechanical,
anything electric,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.740 align:middle line:90%
Nick in this coma could fix it.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:84%
The Nick in this world
couldn't change a light bulb.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, this Nick
has got the skills

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.530 align:middle line:90%
from the Nick in the coma.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:09.910 align:middle line:90%
And he can now fix things.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.230 align:middle line:90%
He fixes his own car.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.600 align:middle line:84%
He fixed his
neighbor's lawnmower.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.750 align:middle line:84%
He fixed his girlfriend's
heating and ventilating system.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't even know
how he knows to do it.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:84%
He's got a walk-in fridge
freezer at his pizza parlor.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.790 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't working.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:24.970 align:middle line:90%
Engineers came.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:25.900 align:middle line:90%
They said, scrap that.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle line:84%
He went in there, fiddled
with it, fixed it.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:28.930 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And his friends are
scratching their heads, right?

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:31.937 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: He's
scratching his head

00:14:31.937 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:90%
because it's blowing his mind.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.660 align:middle line:90%
How does he know this?

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he did madcap
things, like you said.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.240 align:middle line:84%
He won a hot dog eating
contest, as I recall.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.773 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, when he settled
down to this small town--

00:14:41.773 --> 00:14:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In his other life.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about his
small town life

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.780 align:middle line:84%
after all the combat
and wild stuff.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: He was filling
his car up at a gas station.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
very attractive girl

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.850 align:middle line:84%
in the next aisle
filling her car up.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And some guy starts bugging
her, and he intercedes.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And basically, he
gets rid of that guy

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.210 align:middle line:90%
and they become friends.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.900 align:middle line:84%
They become such good friends
that they have a relationship

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.430 align:middle line:84%
and they settle down and
they have a baby girl.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And he discusses the
whole, the birth.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.680 align:middle line:84%
They did a New Age birth thing
in a pool and everything.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about going there
and having the baby and all

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:17.370 align:middle line:90%
the rest of it and that life.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.460 align:middle line:84%
After a time, their relationship
started to break down.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And he was living on
his own separately.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.650 align:middle line:90%
And he wasn't well.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
was wrong with him.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Possibly he had
problems with his heart.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And one day, he just
felt the floor drop away.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.440 align:middle line:90%
And it just fell.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.370 align:middle line:90%
And it was falling.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And he was falling
into nothingness.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.820 align:middle line:84%
But this nothingness
turned into a rainbow,

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:40.110 align:middle line:84%
but a rainbow of colors
he had never seen before.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And as he fell through all
these different colors,

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.260 align:middle line:84%
he would be that color, and he
would drop out of that color,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.780 align:middle line:84%
be soaking wet, and then
drop into another color

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and drop out of that,
and be soaking wet.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And he never felt so at one with
the world, with the universe.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.790 align:middle line:90%
He said he was god.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:57.990 align:middle line:90%
He was the universe.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:59.070 align:middle line:90%
He was everything.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And then when he comes out
of it, comes out of his coma,

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.930 align:middle line:84%
he finds himself
talking to the Moon,

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.270 align:middle line:84%
having conversations
with the universe.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.690 align:middle line:90%
If the Nick before the coma--

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.370 align:middle line:84%
the Nick before the
coma would never

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.880 align:middle line:90%
imagine himself doing that.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.560 align:middle line:90%
He's just not that kind of guy.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.610 align:middle line:90%
Now he is.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.080 align:middle line:90%
Now he's fully spiritual.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.650 align:middle line:90%
And he never was before.

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.608 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he's come
back to a world where

00:16:20.608 --> 00:16:23.250 align:middle line:84%
he has a girlfriend, where the
old Nick was her boyfriend.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, he came back,
and when he opened his eyes,

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:29.110 align:middle line:84%
there's a girl sitting
beside him, holding his hand,

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.170 align:middle line:90%
claiming to be his fiancée.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:33.930 align:middle line:90%
He hasn't got a clue who she is.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Because of the damage to his
vocal cords from the event,

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:37.360 align:middle line:90%
he can't speak.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.870 align:middle line:84%
He can't say, hey, I think
you're in the wrong room.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.093 align:middle line:90%
I'm not who you think I am.

00:16:41.093 --> 00:16:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He didn't
recognize her.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Took him ages, but he
recovered much better than many.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.320 align:middle line:90%
And he wasn't so damaged.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:90%
He didn't think he'd gone mad.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.410 align:middle line:84%
He was quite comfortable
with it in time.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:54.577 align:middle line:90%
But it took him a long time.

00:16:54.577 --> 00:16:56.077 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How long
before he started

00:16:56.077 --> 00:16:57.960 align:middle line:84%
recognizing her and
other people in his life

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.700 align:middle line:90%
or remembering anything?

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: It's going to come in
stages because the life he just

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.599 align:middle line:90%
led, it's got sharper vision.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:05.700 align:middle line:90%
Everything is clearer.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes when people have
a near-death experience,

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.060 align:middle line:84%
they describe it as being
more real than reality.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Nick's alternate life within his
coma was more real than reality.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.349 align:middle line:84%
So when he comes into this
life, it's kind of fuzzy.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:18.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not as clear.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:19.880 align:middle line:90%
This feels like the dream world.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.109 align:middle line:84%
And many a person who
survived a coma have told me

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:26.920 align:middle line:84%
that in this world, they
think they're in the coma,

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.620 align:middle line:84%
that this is the coma
world and the life they

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.370 align:middle line:84%
had within the coma
was their real life.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:33.440 align:middle line:90%
They're so confused.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.572 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't even if
they died and came back.

00:17:35.572 --> 00:17:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't
know where they are.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: They don't
know if they're dead now.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.005 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And this
is one of the things

00:17:41.005 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:84%
we want to do with the book,
is to show other coma survivors

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:45.500 align:middle line:90%
that they are not alone.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.680 align:middle line:84%
The things they
experienced are being

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.713 align:middle line:84%
experienced by thousands, if
not millions of people globally.

00:17:50.713 --> 00:17:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And people sitting
with the people in coma

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.477 align:middle line:84%
having these experiences need
to be understood as well.

00:17:55.477 --> 00:17:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Families really need
to know because the other thing

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.783 align:middle line:84%
is, oftentimes, you
look sort of OK--

00:18:00.783 --> 00:18:02.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, given you've been
in a hospital for so long.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:90%
And you kind of act OK.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.040 align:middle line:90%
But inside, you're a total mess.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And you don't feel that you
are the person that they

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.180 align:middle line:90%
want you to be.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.940 align:middle line:84%
You feel like
you're having to act

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.385 align:middle line:84%
to pretend to be a person that
other people expect you to be.

00:18:16.385 --> 00:18:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And they just feel
totally out of sync.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:90%
And they never settle.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And many a time,
people have told me

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.175 align:middle line:84%
they wish they had
never come back.

00:18:23.175 --> 00:18:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so with
Nick and his girlfriend,

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.180 align:middle line:90%
what happened there?

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: He's OK.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.020 align:middle line:90%
They're fine.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're fine?

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:30.544 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: They're fine.

00:18:30.544 --> 00:18:31.344 align:middle line:90%
They've had a kid.

00:18:31.344 --> 00:18:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he was able to
reintegrate into this world

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:34.000 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.340 align:middle line:84%
This one-- Nick's one
of the lucky ones.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.045 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she accepted
the new Nick, the new,

00:18:40.045 --> 00:18:40.845 align:middle line:90%
more skilled--

00:18:40.845 --> 00:18:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: He eventually
got back into his old life.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:90%
Others just don't.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Others just don't.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.570 align:middle line:84%
They come back and they feel
like they're in the plot

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:84%
of the movie, "Invasion
of the Body Snatchers,"

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.805 align:middle line:84%
where somebody else has--
their friends, their family,

00:18:51.805 --> 00:18:53.180 align:middle line:84%
they're not who
they were before.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:53.980 align:middle line:90%
They're glitchy.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.910 align:middle line:90%
They're just uncaring, unloving.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:57.260 align:middle line:90%
That's how they perceive it.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And they feel that they're
now in some form of hell.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.000 align:middle line:90%
And they just long to get out.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.200 align:middle line:90%
They long to get back.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And many persons, as I say,
wish they hadn't come back.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're quite looking
forward to leaving again.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
can understand that.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.040 align:middle line:90%
So in his case, he came back.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.290 align:middle line:84%
He and his girlfriend
figured it out.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.000 align:middle line:84%
He went somewhat
back to his old ways.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But like you said, he
retained those abilities,

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:23.020 align:middle line:84%
like the mechanical
ability, ability to fix

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.380 align:middle line:90%
mechanical things, for example.

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Which blows his mind.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did he bring some
of the spiritual knowledge

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:90%
with him?

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Or did that go away
pretty quickly?

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: No, he's become
a very spiritual person.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, good.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: He's been a very,
very spiritual person.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And his
girlfriend could basically

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.590 align:middle line:90%
grow with him and all of that.

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.465 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: She was
exceptionally open to this.

00:19:38.465 --> 00:19:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And she was wonderfully kind
and caring and thoughtful.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.838 align:middle line:84%
And really, I think without
having a partner like that,

00:19:44.838 --> 00:19:45.880 align:middle line:90%
Nick would have suffered.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.890 align:middle line:84%
If he hadn't been in a
relationship, a loving,

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.650 align:middle line:84%
caring relationship,
he would have

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.727 align:middle line:84%
been lost, as so many
are when they come out.

00:19:52.727 --> 00:19:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In your
book, you said, too,

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:84%
he didn't want to let
go of his other life.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.220 align:middle line:90%
He had a life.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.928 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: He was
enjoying his other life.

00:19:59.928 --> 00:20:01.180 align:middle line:90%
He'd just had a baby girl.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: OK, the relationship
was breaking down.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.120 align:middle line:84%
But these things
happen in any life.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.750 align:middle line:84%
But he was still--
he still loved

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:90%
his daughter, no matter what.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And his daughter
now doesn't exist.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So now we have--

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.080 align:middle line:84%
so we're talking
about the kind of--

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking here.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:84%
They call it ICU delirium
and prisoner's cinema.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
these two phenomena.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.540 align:middle line:84%
One, ICU delirium,
but also, prisoners

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.430 align:middle line:84%
when they're placed in
solitary confinement

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and a similar thing
that happens to them.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: It's a
lack of stimulation--

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.410 align:middle line:84%
mental, physical,
optical, human.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.510 align:middle line:84%
If you place somebody
in solitary confinement

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.370 align:middle line:84%
for a lengthy
period of time, they

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.720 align:middle line:84%
will start to see
strange things.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Their environment will
change around them.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.870 align:middle line:84%
If, for example, 15 minutes
in solitary confinement,

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:53.650 align:middle line:84%
your mind will start
to create images just

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:55.190 align:middle line:90%
to keep you occupied, I believe.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:84%
But the longer you're
in there, those images

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.580 align:middle line:84%
will change from exquisitely
beautiful, oriental motifs

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.190 align:middle line:84%
through to animals and
people and other scenes,

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:05.350 align:middle line:90%
other landscapes.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And people who are in solitary
confinement can experience this.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And people are in intensive
care with no stimulation

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.560 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever, staring
at a ceiling,

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.950 align:middle line:84%
no one talking to
them, per se, are

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:84%
having the same event happen,
that their mind somehow

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.700 align:middle line:84%
is filling in the blanks,
giving them something

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.323 align:middle line:90%
to occupy their minds.

00:21:26.323 --> 00:21:27.740 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
very similar.

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.837 align:middle line:84%
We can learn by looking
at what happens to people

00:21:29.837 --> 00:21:31.420 align:middle line:84%
in solitary confinement,
people who've

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:36.430 align:middle line:84%
gone into sensory deprivation,
and see what they experience

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and what people experience
within intensive care.

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:44.380 align:middle line:84%
The trouble is, no one seems
to be paying attention to this.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is in intensive
care, you're sick.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:48.620 align:middle line:90%
You're ill.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.970 align:middle line:90%
You'll get better.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And no one wants to discuss
the ins and outs and details--

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.052 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
everything is delusions

00:21:54.052 --> 00:21:56.800 align:middle line:84%
because you might be having some
kind of weird IV painkillers

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.350 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.290 align:middle line:84%
So they assume you're really
not in your right mind.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.457 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: They assume you're
not in your right mind.

00:22:01.457 --> 00:22:05.150 align:middle line:84%
But just being in intensive
care, to be in intensive care,

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:07.480 align:middle line:90%
you need to be near death.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.040 align:middle line:84%
So it figures you may be
having a near-death experience

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:10.840 align:middle line:90%
down the line.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And the medication
they give you just

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:90%
pushes you that much further.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.560 align:middle line:84%
It's very unusual to measure
brain activity for somebody

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.090 align:middle line:84%
who's in a medically induced
coma, say during COVID,

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:20.890 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.300 align:middle line:84%
No one was looking at
an EEG brain scanner.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.250 align:middle line:84%
If they had a brain
injury, they might.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:27.850 align:middle line:84%
One doctor I know who helped
us with the book, Dr. Wesley

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Lee of Vanderbilt, he
became really alarmed

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.980 align:middle line:84%
that things were
happening to his patients,

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.010 align:middle line:84%
that he was possibly
causing a massive harm.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.810 align:middle line:84%
So he started connecting
his patients up

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:40.120 align:middle line:90%
to an EEG brain scanner.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.110 align:middle line:90%
He was horrified.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:44.510 align:middle line:84%
They were deeper than
he ever imagined.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:47.740 align:middle line:84%
He said it was like looking
at a heart without a pulse.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.210 align:middle line:84%
It was a flatline, a
burst of suppression.

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:53.840 align:middle line:84%
He had no idea they were sending
people that low, that far down--

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.850 align:middle line:90%
horrified.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you go that far down,
it is not necessarily a blank.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.862 align:middle line:84%
All sorts of strange things
are happening to you.

00:23:01.862 --> 00:23:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just not
registering on the EEG.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:04.620 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: No.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And this goes to show that
the mind and the brain, really

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:08.990 align:middle line:90%
not the same thing.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:12.123 align:middle line:10%
>>PEARCE: The mind is going
off on adventures of its own

00:23:12.123 --> 00:23:15.500 align:middle line:10%
when the body is held trapped
within the hospital environment.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.600 align:middle line:10%
You don't need to be
in a coma to do that.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.080 align:middle line:10%
And I'm led to believe
that people are suffering

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.090 align:middle line:10%
from different
forms of dementia,

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.360 align:middle line:10%
when they feel that they're
talking to their long-dead wife

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.050 align:middle line:10%
or something, they
actually are there.

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: They've
gone back in time.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.510 align:middle line:84%
They are experiencing
these things.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Other people within
their coma told me

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.260 align:middle line:90%
that they went back in time.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And they were a child
again, having dinner

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.470 align:middle line:84%
with their mom and dad, holding
conversations, tasting the roast

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.270 align:middle line:90%
chicken.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.990 align:middle line:84%
They were there,
100% in the moment.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.170 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if people who've
got Alzheimer's are

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.125 align:middle line:90%
having similar events.

00:23:48.125 --> 00:23:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I would
imagine they are.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And again, people close
to death who are conscious

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.400 align:middle line:84%
are more or less
going in and out

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.770 align:middle line:84%
into the other place
and this place.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And their family says oh,
my god, they're crazy.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the crazy
things they're saying.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Instead of joining them
and saying, tell me more.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:06.080 align:middle line:90%
I want to know where you are.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:06.620 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.420 align:middle line:90%
Who are you with?

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:08.430 align:middle line:90%
What was it like?

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:09.805 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: The
chances are they're

00:24:09.805 --> 00:24:12.350 align:middle line:84%
having a beautiful experience
and we don't know this.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is another
thing about brain death.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.320 align:middle line:84%
But supposing you're
in a vehicle accident

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.100 align:middle line:84%
and you're marked
down as brain dead,

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.808 align:middle line:84%
but you've got a
beating heart and you're

00:24:20.808 --> 00:24:22.190 align:middle line:90%
ripe for transplant surgery.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:23.780 align:middle line:90%
You're ripe for harvesting.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:84%
They may be taking organs
out of somebody whose mind

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.270 align:middle line:90%
is incredibly active.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Just because the
brain is flatlining

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:32.010 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean that they are.

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:33.010 align:middle line:90%
They could be somewhere.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And you might be taking those
organs out of somebody who

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:84%
was having a wonderfully
rich existence

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.707 align:middle line:84%
and may well have come
back to this world in time.

00:24:40.707 --> 00:24:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's a grim thought.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: It's a
horrifying thought.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
go into another example

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:48.530 align:middle line:84%
because it was very
touching-- a little difficult,

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.230 align:middle line:90%
but very touching, Nikki.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, Nikki.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Nikki is what you would
call a really mumsy person.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.100 align:middle line:90%
And she already had a young boy.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And she contracted
pneumonia as well.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:00.710 align:middle line:90%
And that turned to sepsis.

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors
said to her husband,

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:06.170 align:middle line:84%
"I don't think she's going
to survive the night."

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:07.848 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
going to do, we're

00:25:07.848 --> 00:25:09.890 align:middle line:84%
going to place her into
a medically induced coma,

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.740 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
best chance she has.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.000 align:middle line:84%
They examined her and they
realized she was pregnant.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And they said to
her husband, did you

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.147 align:middle line:90%
know your wife was pregnant?

00:25:17.147 --> 00:25:18.480 align:middle line:90%
He said, "No, we had no idea.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.120 align:middle line:84%
We've been trying,
but we didn't know."

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.180 align:middle line:84%
They said, "Well,
I'm really sorry.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.347 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
terminate the pregnancy while

00:25:23.347 --> 00:25:25.010 align:middle line:90%
she's in the coma."

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, bearing in mind Nikki
didn't know she was pregnant,

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:32.460 align:middle line:84%
within her coma, many times
people within a coma will say,

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.200 align:middle line:84%
"I woke up within my coma and
I found myself in a particular

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.170 align:middle line:90%
reality."

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Nikki wakes up within her
coma and finds herself

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:42.360 align:middle line:90%
on a train in India.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.950 align:middle line:84%
She's in an individual
carriage compartment.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And everything is laid
out for a newborn baby.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.850 align:middle line:84%
There's baby clothes, there's
nappies, there's a wash stand,

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:54.960 align:middle line:90%
there's all sorts.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And Nikki realizes
she's pregnant.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And she gives birth
within this compartment.

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.280 align:middle line:90%
And she's holding this baby.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.250 align:middle line:90%
And she looks in his eyes.

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:05.810 align:middle line:90%
And she's blown away.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.680 align:middle line:84%
This baby has the most
stunning blue eyes

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.850 align:middle line:84%
of a blue she says
she'd never seen before,

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:16.380 align:middle line:84%
that just cut straight
into her soul.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.950 align:middle line:90%
This baby is called Baby Mason.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.200 align:middle line:84%
In that world, she
eventually finds herself

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.970 align:middle line:84%
in a hospital in Scotland
where she came from.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And all the nurses
in that hospital

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:30.460 align:middle line:84%
would come by to see Baby Mason
and his stunning blue eyes.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.448 align:middle line:90%
Nikki comes out of her coma.

00:26:32.448 --> 00:26:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: After how long?

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:34.220 align:middle line:84%
She was in for a while,
a month as I recall.

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Oh, she was a
long time, as I recall.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.425 align:middle line:84%
More than a month,
nearly two months.

00:26:37.425 --> 00:26:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And she was in the
hospital for a lot long--

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was she
intubated the whole time?

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: --because of the
damage for a long time.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.250 align:middle line:84%
When she starts to regain her
faculties, she wants her baby.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:47.320 align:middle line:90%
She wants Baby Mason.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.897 align:middle line:84%
So she's rocking
her arms, saying--

00:26:49.897 --> 00:26:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where's my baby?

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Where's my baby?

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's showing her
photographs of her firstborn

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:54.930 align:middle line:90%
son.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And she's getting really
angry, but she can't speak.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:58.885 align:middle line:90%
This goes on for a long time.

00:26:58.885 --> 00:27:00.260 align:middle line:84%
This is freaking
her husband out,

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.978 align:middle line:84%
by the way, because he
knows she's had an abortion.

00:27:03.978 --> 00:27:05.020 align:middle line:90%
And she's rocking a baby.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does she know
yet she's had an abortion?

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:08.348 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: No, she
has no knowledge.

00:27:08.348 --> 00:27:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, boy.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Fast forward.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Some time later, the
doctors tell her,

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.230 align:middle line:84%
when she leaves hospital
a long time after,

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.810 align:middle line:84%
that she would never be able
to carry a child again, ever.

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:18.130 align:middle line:90%
Well, she does.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:23.220 align:middle line:84%
She gives birth this time
in a hospital in Scotland.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.092 align:middle line:84%
The matron of the
hospital, the midwife?

00:27:26.092 --> 00:27:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is this-- no, what?

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.560 align:middle line:90%
Is she in the coma or not coma?

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: No.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Now she's in real-- this
world, having a baby.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She had a real baby?

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: In this world.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.840 align:middle line:90%
The baby's born.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.490 align:middle line:90%
The midwife is holding the baby.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.530 align:middle line:84%
What's the first thing
the midwife says?

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:39.630 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: His blue eyes?

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: His blue eyes.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.540 align:middle line:90%
They're a blue I've never seen.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:90%
They burn into your soul.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.350 align:middle line:84%
When I look at photographs
of Nikki and her family,

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:50.920 align:middle line:84%
everyone's got brown eyes, so
brown they're virtually black,

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.480 align:middle line:84%
except this boy whose eyes are
a stunning blue, like they're

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.320 align:middle line:90%
shining out of the photograph.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, she thinks it's not
the same child necessarily,

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.993 align:middle line:84%
because they are
slightly different.

00:28:01.993 --> 00:28:02.910 align:middle line:90%
But the similarities--

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Could be the soul.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: It could
be the same soul.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The soul was
showing her what was coming.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.690 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me, I would guess--
this is just my thought--

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:16.390 align:middle line:84%
that while she was away, so
to speak, in the other field,

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:18.180 align:middle line:84%
they were showing
what was coming up.

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And then they incarnated
into the little body

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:21.635 align:middle line:90%
once she was pregnant.

00:28:21.635 --> 00:28:22.435 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yes.

00:28:22.435 --> 00:28:23.560 align:middle line:90%
That's how I'm seeing it.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's beautiful,
with the beautiful outcome.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.470 align:middle line:84%
But she was disturbed
initially when she came out.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:29.270 align:middle line:90%
Where's my baby?

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:29.840 align:middle line:90%
Where's my baby?

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:30.923 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Where's my baby?

00:28:30.923 --> 00:28:34.130 align:middle line:84%
No one could answer because
she couldn't speak for so long.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she couldn't actually
speak for more than a month.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:39.306 align:middle line:84%
And her husband, enormously
understanding-- again,

00:28:39.306 --> 00:28:42.460 align:middle line:84%
she was exceptionally lucky
to have the family support.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Others come out, and they
just think, you're OK.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.190 align:middle line:90%
Get over it, you know?

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.990 align:middle line:90%
You look fine.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:49.032 align:middle line:90%
So what, you've been ill?

00:28:49.032 --> 00:28:51.370 align:middle line:84%
You've had the best
treatment possible.

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:52.480 align:middle line:90%
Get on with your life.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.022 align:middle line:84%
And they can't get
on with their life

00:28:54.022 --> 00:28:55.700 align:middle line:84%
because maybe they're
missing a partner.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they're missing children.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they just don't feel
that they belong in this world.

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:01.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's just horrifying.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's no one
they can talk to.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.390 align:middle line:84%
So as I said, one of the things
we aim to do with this book

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:10.150 align:middle line:84%
is to show people who've been
through these experiences

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:11.182 align:middle line:90%
that they are not alone.

00:29:11.182 --> 00:29:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But even
more-- and we'll

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.180 align:middle line:90%
get into that in just a sec.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Are there some that even after
they come back to this reality,

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.520 align:middle line:84%
continue either in
dream time or what

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.410 align:middle line:84%
seem like their
imagination, they're still

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:24.860 align:middle line:90%
living that parallel life?

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: They're going
backwards and forwards,

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:26.720 align:middle line:90%
many of--

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All the time.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Those who've had
the nightmarish events do not

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:32.890 align:middle line:90%
want to go to sleep.

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:35.360 align:middle line:84%
One or two have told me that
they will not sleep at night.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.110 align:middle line:84%
They will only doze on
a couch during the day

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.700 align:middle line:84%
when there's other people
around, because they feel safe.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.780 align:middle line:84%
They cannot go to sleep at night
because they find themselves

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:44.840 align:middle line:90%
back in that world.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Their dreams become infinitely
more vivid than they ever,

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.590 align:middle line:90%
ever were before.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And they go back
to these other dimensions,

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.220 align:middle line:90%
to where they were.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.110 align:middle line:84%
It's OK, perhaps, if they
had a lovely experience.

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Except, of course, if you're
back with your loved one

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and you wake up and
you're not with them.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.302 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
not with them, yeah.

00:30:02.302 --> 00:30:06.295 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: When you find yourself
back in some hellish zone,

00:30:06.295 --> 00:30:07.930 align:middle line:90%
this just snaps their minds.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And they really think
they have gone insane.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so just to go into
the physical part of it a bit,

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:19.660 align:middle line:84%
with someone like Nikki, who
was under for so long in a coma,

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.100 align:middle line:84%
how long does it take to
recover the functions of,

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.917 align:middle line:84%
first your speech, and then
your body, your muscles?

00:30:26.917 --> 00:30:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Months, if ever.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.420 align:middle line:84%
It depends how
long you were down.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:30.530 align:middle line:90%
The longer you were down--

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:33.370 align:middle line:84%
they used to say
that bed rest is

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:34.860 align:middle line:90%
the best thing for an illness.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: They said this
for about 2,000 years.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Now it's shown that just
one week of bed rest

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.840 align:middle line:84%
can result in the loss
of 40% of lean muscle.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Everything goes.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:50.230 align:middle line:84%
You can lose so much muscle
that it's not noticeable

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:53.410 align:middle line:84%
because they've pumped you
so full of fluids to maintain

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:55.780 align:middle line:84%
your heart, your blood pressure,
and all the rest of it,

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.015 align:middle line:90%
that you look fairly normal.

00:30:57.015 --> 00:30:57.890 align:middle line:90%
But you're all puffy.

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:00.170 align:middle line:84%
There's no muscle
inside that skin.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:03.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just fluid, 50 pounds
excess weight in fluid

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:04.825 align:middle line:90%
you may be carrying.

00:31:04.825 --> 00:31:05.625 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:31:05.625 --> 00:31:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And you
can't stand up.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:09.490 align:middle line:84%
You can't swallow
because all the muscles

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:10.540 align:middle line:90%
have gone in your throat.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, dormant.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: You're
so deconditioned.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Your diaphragm won't
work on its own.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
have help breathing

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.400 align:middle line:90%
for so long after the event.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you didn't
place somebody in a coma,

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:27.140 align:middle line:84%
they weren't suffering a lengthy
period without moving a muscle,

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:30.770 align:middle line:84%
literally, if you can
keep them conscious,

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:32.360 align:middle line:84%
keep them on the
vent and conscious,

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.730 align:middle line:84%
have them walk around,
walking 100 paces a day,

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:38.150 align:middle line:84%
getting up, sitting in a
chair, interacting with people,

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:40.300 align:middle line:84%
they don't get these
long-term problems.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And they can actually walk
out of the intensive care

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.670 align:middle line:84%
unit, whereas the
majority of people who've

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:48.580 align:middle line:84%
been placed in comas, only
leave that intensive care

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.750 align:middle line:90%
unit on a gurney.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.650 align:middle line:90%
And they go to another facility.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors and nurses
in that intensive care unit

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:57.760 align:middle line:84%
do not ever get to
follow up their patients.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.650 align:middle line:84%
When I say ever, it's
largely the case.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:03.200 align:middle line:84%
No one follows the medical
system, doesn't work that way.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Doesn't follow up.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: So they're
further down the line

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.820 align:middle line:84%
when they're regaining
their senses,

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.070 align:middle line:84%
when they're regaining
their vocal cords.

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:12.500 align:middle line:84%
They may wish to talk
about it to someone.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.292 align:middle line:84%
Say, hey, doc, what the hell
was that I've just been through?

00:32:15.292 --> 00:32:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And they say, oh,
don't worry about that.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a false memory.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:19.230 align:middle line:90%
You'll get over it.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has it.

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:21.110 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:22.670 align:middle line:90%
But it's like, everyone has it?

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:23.730 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it?

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:25.050 align:middle line:90%
You don't get over it.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:26.592 align:middle line:84%
And you shouldn't
be placing somebody

00:32:26.592 --> 00:32:29.930 align:middle line:84%
into a prolonged,
deep sedation anyway.

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:33.950 align:middle line:84%
You cannot find a single
medical textbook that advocates

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:35.970 align:middle line:90%
prolonged deep sedation.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:37.560 align:middle line:90%
Here's the interesting thing.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.650 align:middle line:84%
So more often now,
they don't like

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:41.330 align:middle line:84%
to give people
general anesthetics

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:43.370 align:middle line:84%
if they can give them a
local because they know

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.150 align:middle line:90%
it will cause cognitive damage.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Just four to six hours
on an operating table,

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.690 align:middle line:84%
you can lose up to
10 points of your IQ.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:52.220 align:middle line:90%
Now that's hours.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the same medication
that they give you

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:56.903 align:middle line:84%
in the operating theater
that they give you in a coma.

00:32:56.903 --> 00:32:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To keep you the
whole time you're sedated?

00:32:59.070 --> 00:32:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:01.830 align:middle line:84%
It depends on
availability and whatnot.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:04.320 align:middle line:84%
But more or less,
it's the same thing.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.060 align:middle line:84%
If they know within
four hours, you're

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.740 align:middle line:84%
going to get cognitive
damage, what's

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:10.807 align:middle line:84%
going to happen after four
weeks, eight weeks, or whatever?

00:33:10.807 --> 00:33:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or months?

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And all this medication
is stuck in your system

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:18.407 align:middle line:84%
because your kidneys don't
go through the 24-hour cycle

00:33:18.407 --> 00:33:20.740 align:middle line:84%
because you're not going
through your circadian rhythms,

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.340 align:middle line:84%
because your brain's
switched off.

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.820 align:middle line:90%
So all this med--

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.050 align:middle line:84%
these meds are staying
in your system.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you do survive the coma,
it's still in your system.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And it can take some people
ages, weeks and weeks and weeks

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:36.930 align:middle line:84%
to gain consciousness after
the meds have been turned off,

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.000 align:middle line:84%
because there's so much
within their system.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.640 align:middle line:90%
And they never feel right again.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.920 align:middle line:84%
You can lose, say, 10 points, as
I say, on the operating table.

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Imagine how many
points off your IQ

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:49.590 align:middle line:84%
you can lose when you've been in
a coma for two months or more.

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Almost leaves
a person a vegetable.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:52.907 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Some
people-- one person

00:33:52.907 --> 00:33:54.420 align:middle line:84%
told me she came
out of a coma, she

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.590 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what humans were.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:57.653 align:middle line:90%
She had no concepts.

00:33:57.653 --> 00:33:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:33:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Forget not knowing
who your family are,

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:03.670 align:middle line:84%
not understanding
who are humans,

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:05.880 align:middle line:90%
not understanding who she is.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.820 align:middle line:90%
Am I human?

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:07.860 align:middle line:90%
What is a human?

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Not knowing that-- and they've
existed on other planes where

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:12.810 align:middle line:90%
they've been--

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:13.659 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Non-human,

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:14.492 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Non-human.

00:34:14.492 --> 00:34:17.350 align:middle line:84%
They've been part of the spirit
world, part of the universe.

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:19.980 align:middle line:84%
They felt that they
were the universe.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it sounds like one
of the major, major issues--

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.679 align:middle line:84%
thank you for writing this
book and doing this research.

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I know you had a tragic
event along the way

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.530 align:middle line:90%
during the writing.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:30.655 align:middle line:90%
You lost your own daughter.

00:34:30.655 --> 00:34:31.455 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: I did.

00:34:31.455 --> 00:34:33.219 align:middle line:84%
But now she feels like
part of the story.

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:35.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's strange to this--
any parent who loses a child,

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.100 align:middle line:84%
it's the worst thing that
can ever, ever happen to you.

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:38.969 align:middle line:90%
I had all of that.

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: But at
the same time, I

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.220 align:middle line:84%
realized that my daughter
wasn't dead dead?

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.219 align:middle line:90%
That was the silver lining.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:46.719 align:middle line:90%
You were learning all of this.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: But I didn't
set out on this path.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And I realized what I had
learned in writing the book--

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:52.745 align:middle line:84%
and I was only
halfway through it

00:34:52.745 --> 00:34:54.639 align:middle line:84%
at this point-- had
changed my mindset.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Everything that changed
my mindset is in the book.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:59.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's not
designed to be that.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.500 align:middle line:84%
It is an exploration
into a highly dubious

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.740 align:middle line:90%
medical procedure.

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And we get to follow
up the patients

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:06.080 align:middle line:90%
and see what they experienced.

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And we meet doctors and nurses
who put their hands up and say,

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.530 align:middle line:90%
I've killed patients.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:11.510 align:middle line:84%
I've killed patients with
the best will in the world.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to now wake
up all the doctors and nurses.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:15.302 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I want
to get into that that.

00:35:15.302 --> 00:35:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And so you were able to
integrate this experience

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.182 align:middle line:84%
and understand, "I'm
alive and well, dad?"

00:35:20.182 --> 00:35:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, because I
spoke to so many people who

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:23.817 align:middle line:90%
died and came back.

00:35:23.817 --> 00:35:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And when I say died, I
mean clinically died, as in

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.710 align:middle line:90%
had to be resusced, et cetera.

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:31.028 align:middle line:84%
Or people that were so low that
they weren't in this world.

00:35:31.028 --> 00:35:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were
essentially dead.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:35.620 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:38.387 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I'm so glad
the timing was such for you.

00:35:38.387 --> 00:35:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: So I knew my
daughter hadn't died.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: I mean--

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She just
transitioned out of this.

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:45.553 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: You could say this is
where science and spirituality

00:35:45.553 --> 00:35:48.460 align:middle line:84%
collide, because the first rule
of thermodynamics says that

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.600 align:middle line:84%
energy cannot be
created nor destroyed.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.620 align:middle line:90%
We're all energy.

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.790 align:middle line:84%
My daughter, Rebecca,
was a ball of energy.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Where did that go?

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:55.810 align:middle line:90%
It had to go somewhere.

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:57.170 align:middle line:90%
And I know it went somewhere.

00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And I felt enormous
comfort from that.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I'm
so happy for that.

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:03.075 align:middle line:84%
But we have a problem
with the medical system.

00:36:03.075 --> 00:36:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Massive.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And like
you said, there is not

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.300 align:middle line:90%
much written on this topic.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.080 align:middle line:84%
You took the time to sit
for long periods of time

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.930 align:middle line:84%
to be with each of these people,
to gain their confidence,

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:15.730 align:middle line:84%
so you could get
the full richness

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:17.260 align:middle line:90%
of what they've been through.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.900 align:middle line:84%
So now that we know
this, first of all,

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:23.740 align:middle line:84%
did you meet people in the
medical field that were saying,

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:25.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't think this is right?

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:26.510 align:middle line:90%
We're not liking what we see.

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Oh, yes.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:27.740 align:middle line:90%
It took me a while to find them.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's talk
about what they had to say.

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:32.208 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, the nurses
were the ones that were just

00:36:32.208 --> 00:36:34.120 align:middle line:90%
like, this is not good.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: The nurses gets
more hands-on experience.

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.800 align:middle line:90%
They're there with them.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: They can see people
in coma who are not supposed

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.320 align:middle line:90%
to be experiencing anything.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.660 align:middle line:84%
They see them crying
within their coma.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.108 align:middle line:90%
They're experiencing something.

00:36:46.108 --> 00:36:47.150 align:middle line:90%
What the heck's going on?

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:48.470 align:middle line:90%
It's very distressing.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you switch the meds
off to bring them back out

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.920 align:middle line:84%
and they are fighting and
biting and all the rest of it,

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.170 align:middle line:90%
it breaks their heart.

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:57.670 align:middle line:84%
You look into their
eyes and you see

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.620 align:middle line:90%
the sheer terror in their eyes.

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And out of kindness,
most doctors and nurses

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.420 align:middle line:84%
will put those
meds back up again.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And they're just putting them
back into this terrible world.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.755 align:middle line:84%
It took me ages
to find a doctor--

00:37:08.755 --> 00:37:11.830 align:middle line:84%
or if I started with finding
a nurse practitioner called

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Kaylee Dayton, who's
a hero in this world.

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:18.640 align:middle line:84%
She is on an incredible
battle to change

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.620 align:middle line:90%
doctors' and nurses' thinking.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.050 align:middle line:84%
She recently looked
like she was going

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:26.080 align:middle line:84%
to lose her license because
people were complaining that she

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.750 align:middle line:84%
was not putting people into
comas when they were very sick

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:30.080 align:middle line:90%
and they really should be.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And she had to fight
her corner there.

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:35.710 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, there isn't any
medical literature anywhere

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.620 align:middle line:84%
that advocates
prolonged deep sedation.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: There's none.

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she had
that on her side.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: She had on her side.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.470 align:middle line:90%
And yet everyone does it.

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And they do it out of the
goodness, out of kindness.

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:45.050 align:middle line:90%
They do it out of kindness.

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:47.360 align:middle line:84%
They think they're sparing
the patient trauma.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.457 align:middle line:84%
What they don't know is where
they're sending their patients.

00:37:50.457 --> 00:37:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're sending
their patients to heaven

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.950 align:middle line:84%
and they're having a lovely,
lovely, beautiful time.

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:58.400 align:middle line:84%
More often than not, they're
having an horrendous time.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.390 align:middle line:90%
And doctors can't explain--

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:03.990 align:middle line:84%
no one can seem to seemingly
explain consciousness,

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:05.550 align:middle line:90%
the one we're experiencing now.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: They haven't got
a chance, any chance of--

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're not trained in
that, obviously, unless they--

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: They can't.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:12.010 align:middle line:90%
So they don't what to say.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: So they give them a
diagnosis, which is effectively

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.080 align:middle line:84%
a form of mental--
they'll say you've

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.320 align:middle line:90%
got a form of mental illness.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.260 align:middle line:84%
There are medications
that you can take.

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:22.580 align:middle line:84%
There's things we can give
you to help relieve this.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's talk about
the doctor that you finally

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.930 align:middle line:84%
were able to connect with, and
what's happening from there,

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:30.990 align:middle line:84%
and if you're
seeing any progress.

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: There
is slow progress.

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Nurses are waking up to it.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.760 align:middle line:84%
About 10 years ago,
something like 86% of nurses

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.220 align:middle line:84%
felt that prolonged
deep sedation was

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.640 align:middle line:90%
the best thing for patients.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Now we're into the realms
of 60-something percent,

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:46.770 align:middle line:90%
so we're slowly getting there.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Most doctors, doctors are
the hardest ones to train.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Many a time, doctors practice
experience-based medicine as

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.330 align:middle line:84%
opposed to
evidence-based medicine.

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So if they don't see
anything going wrong

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and they think they're
doing the right thing,

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:02.890 align:middle line:90%
they'll just keep doing it.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even if the
evidence suggests otherwise.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Except they
don't see the evidence,

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.575 align:middle line:84%
because when the patient leaves
that intensive care unit,

00:39:08.575 --> 00:39:09.830 align:middle line:90%
they don't see them again.

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else has to
deal with that problem.

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:14.650 align:middle line:84%
They turn around, they're
sedating the next patient,

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:15.650 align:middle line:90%
and then so on.

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And it has become a conveyor
belt of care, intensive care.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a
conveyor belt where

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.390 align:middle line:84%
no one looks over their shoulder
and sees the product coming off

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:27.370 align:middle line:90%
the other end.

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:30.910 align:middle line:84%
We wish to wake up doctors
and nurses very much

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:33.670 align:middle line:84%
so to what people are
experiencing within a coma,

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:35.120 align:middle line:90%
because it's not a bad dream.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.050 align:middle line:90%
It's more than that.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:37.810 align:middle line:90%
These are nothing like dreams.

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you also said
in the book that you can--

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:43.180 align:middle line:84%
some of these experiences
can be likened

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.090 align:middle line:84%
to what people experience
on DMT and Ayahuasca

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and things that
have been studied.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Now if doctors have something
that they can relate to,

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:56.350 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, in the academic
world, such as studies

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.840 align:middle line:84%
on the effects of
DMT, and then they're

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.302 align:middle line:90%
exposed to work like yours--

00:40:00.302 --> 00:40:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: But they
need to read it.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.720 align:middle line:90%
And they're not reading it.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.700 align:middle line:90%
They're all too busy.

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.870 align:middle line:84%
The way the modern
medical world--

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:06.037 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I do get that.

00:40:06.037 --> 00:40:08.860 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, I'm just saying
in an ideal situation,

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.130 align:middle line:84%
at least they would have
something to say, look at,

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:13.820 align:middle line:84%
we're understanding this is
what some of our patients

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:14.620 align:middle line:90%
are going through.

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.148 align:middle line:84%
But you did connect
with one doctor.

00:40:16.148 --> 00:40:17.440 align:middle line:90%
Tell us a little bit about him.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.190 align:middle line:90%
It took a while.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, Dr.
Wesley, he's a professor

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:21.700 align:middle line:84%
of medicine at
Vanderbilt University,

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.065 align:middle line:84%
one of the finest medical
schools on the planet.

00:40:24.065 --> 00:40:25.015 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:40:25.015 --> 00:40:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Early
on, his first job

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:29.420 align:middle line:90%
was working in intensive care.

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And all of his patients
were unconscious,

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:34.070 align:middle line:90%
like sacks of potatoes in a bed.

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And normally, you don't
get to follow up a patient.

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:38.630 align:middle line:84%
But one particular
patient, his first patient,

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:39.720 align:middle line:90%
had a chest wound.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.480 align:middle line:90%
So she needed to come back.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.680 align:middle line:90%
And she came back.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:45.230 align:middle line:84%
He was really excited to
see his first success story.

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:47.930 align:middle line:84%
She came into the room in a
wheelchair with her mother

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:49.768 align:middle line:90%
and she couldn't speak.

00:40:49.768 --> 00:40:50.810 align:middle line:90%
She was effectively mute.

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And her mother's saying,
what's wrong with her?

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:54.970 align:middle line:90%
She can't speak hardly.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:56.480 align:middle line:90%
She can't move her arms.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.990 align:middle line:90%
She can't lift anything.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.950 align:middle line:90%
She can't shower.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:00.330 align:middle line:90%
She can't go to the restroom.

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:01.440 align:middle line:90%
She can't do anything.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.430 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with her?

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And he was thinking,
hold on a second.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.320 align:middle line:84%
She came in with
one complication

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and we've given her a whole
other set of complications.

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they
induce a coma with her?

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Huh?

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they
induce a coma?

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: They induced a coma.

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And he's thinking,
we're causing these problems.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.910 align:middle line:84%
He went off and did something
else for a while, worked

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.060 align:middle line:90%
in transplant surgery.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And you have to get to know
your patients really well

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:24.310 align:middle line:90%
for transplant.

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:26.393 align:middle line:84%
And you have to get to
know the family really well

00:41:26.393 --> 00:41:28.560 align:middle line:84%
to know if the backup,
the support is there.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.450 align:middle line:84%
What he learned
in transplants he

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:32.290 align:middle line:90%
brought back to intensive care.

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to
know his patients.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And he got to know his
patients very, very well.

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.780 align:middle line:90%
And then he started--

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:40.780 align:middle line:90%
he did this.

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:41.770 align:middle line:90%
This never happens.

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:44.940 align:middle line:84%
He connected his patients
up to an EEG brain scanner

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.917 align:middle line:84%
just to see how
deeply down they were,

00:41:46.917 --> 00:41:48.750 align:middle line:84%
thinking they were kind
of like halfway down

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:49.870 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:51.250 align:middle line:90%
He was horrified.

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:54.660 align:middle line:84%
They were flatlining, a burst
suppression, like a heart

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:55.920 align:middle line:90%
without a pulse.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.710 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't believe he'd
sent people that far down.

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.630 align:middle line:84%
He then started
trying to find ways

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:03.390 align:middle line:84%
of avoiding prolonged,
deep sedation,

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.180 align:middle line:84%
putting somebody on a mechanical
ventilator, which most doctors

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:08.920 align:middle line:84%
and nurses will say if you're
on a mechanical ventilator,

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:09.970 align:middle line:90%
you must be knocked out.

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:11.810 align:middle line:84%
You cannot tolerate
this conscious.

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:13.630 align:middle line:90%
He figured that wasn't the case.

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And instead of just knocking
people out as a matter of course

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:17.812 align:middle line:84%
without even telling
them that you're

00:42:17.812 --> 00:42:20.850 align:middle line:84%
going to do this, he talked
to his patients and said,

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:24.070 align:middle line:84%
what we need to do, we need
to put you on a ventilator.

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:27.180 align:middle line:84%
But the medical literature
is quite clear about this.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.650 align:middle line:90%
You can remain conscious.

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:30.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's much better if you do.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Would you like to be that way.

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:33.640 align:middle line:90%
And most people would say yes.

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.400 align:middle line:84%
So he would knock them out
for 20 minutes, 30 minutes,

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.420 align:middle line:84%
all the rest of it,
put the tube in,

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.790 align:middle line:90%
and then gently bring them out.

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And in an ideal world,
you'd have a family member

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:45.520 align:middle line:84%
sitting beside them, holding
their hand, reassuring them.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.533 align:middle line:90%
And they come out.

00:42:46.533 --> 00:42:47.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, they're feeling
a bit panicky.

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:50.010 align:middle line:84%
They've got this weird
thing in their throat.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:53.890 align:middle line:84%
But in time, if you
distract their attention--

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:57.038 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, like you said
earlier, they become used to it.

00:42:57.038 --> 00:42:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, they can.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
can move around.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So he realized that
his patients were

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:07.170 align:middle line:84%
getting better as opposed to
being so deconditioned they're

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:08.940 align:middle line:84%
either staying in
there much, much longer

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.240 align:middle line:84%
in their intensive care unit, or
they're going to a care facility

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.950 align:middle line:84%
down the line and never
seeing them again.

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And he found that his
patients were walking out

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:19.240 align:middle line:90%
of the intensive care unit.

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is what Kaylee
Dayton, the nurse practitioner,

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:22.380 align:middle line:90%
was finding.

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And bit by bit, they
meet each other,

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and other doctors and
nurses meet each other.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to say, did their peers

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:28.870 align:middle line:90%
find out about this?

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, they do somehow.

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I think the internet's got a lot
to do with that, because also,

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:35.198 align:middle line:84%
if you go to a conference
and you stand up on a stage

00:43:35.198 --> 00:43:37.240 align:middle line:84%
and you tell a whole bunch
of doctors and nurses,

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.282 align:middle line:84%
you're doing this wrong,
you're killing patients,

00:43:39.282 --> 00:43:41.070 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
get a great reception.

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:42.190 align:middle line:90%
You really are not.

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And
mostly people are--

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:48.490 align:middle line:84%
they're laughed at or people
just think they're crazy.

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it seems to me this
book serves three audiences.

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.150 align:middle line:84%
It gives the people
who've been in a coma

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and experienced that a chance to
see that, A, they're not crazy,

00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and that they're having a
very amazing experience when

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:02.260 align:middle line:90%
they were on the other side.

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Good or bad, they were somewhere
else and they lived to tell it.

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:08.820 align:middle line:84%
You're also talking to people
who are with people sitting with

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:11.970 align:middle line:84%
people in comas-- friends and
family of those in a coma--

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:13.540 align:middle line:90%
saying be very careful.

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:15.370 align:middle line:84%
They may be fully aware
of what's going on.

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: They may
be fully aware.

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They may be in
another life somewhere.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:18.640 align:middle line:90%
They may be fully aware.

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.700 align:middle line:84%
But be very gentle and speak
as though they're alive.

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you're speaking
to the medical industry

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.760 align:middle line:84%
to say, look, this
has to change.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:27.650 align:middle line:90%
This is important.

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: But you can't.

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:32.250 align:middle line:84%
I've been trying to interest
medical journalists in this.

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:33.780 align:middle line:90%
I've got a book coming out.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.075 align:middle line:90%
They think I'm crazy, too.

00:44:35.075 --> 00:44:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my god.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.325 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: They're
telling me, hey, pal.

00:44:37.325 --> 00:44:40.290 align:middle line:84%
This has been the standard
form of medical care

00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:41.620 align:middle line:90%
for the last 50 years.

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Who are you to come along and
say they're doing it wrong?

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you took the
time to care and find out.

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: I'm so glad we did.

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:50.508 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm so
glad you did, too.

00:44:50.508 --> 00:44:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And I really hope they start
listening more and more

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and that the book gets
out there, especially

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:56.230 align:middle line:90%
among medical personnel.

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:57.250 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to thank
you for taking the time

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:03.600 align:middle line:84%
to hear, to care enough about
all these people, to get

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.942 align:middle line:90%
to know them and their stories.

00:45:04.942 --> 00:45:06.900 align:middle line:10%
>>PEARCE: Once I started
meeting coma survivors

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.130 align:middle line:10%
and hearing their stories,
my heart went out to them.

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:09.930 align:middle line:10%
I'm a journalist.

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:12.190 align:middle line:10%
I've interviewed a lot
of torture survivors,

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:14.860 align:middle line:10%
not about their torture,
but their life stories.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:17.470 align:middle line:84%
These people react
in the same way.

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:19.720 align:middle line:84%
You've got to
tread so carefully.

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.040 align:middle line:90%
You can't just go straight in.

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.040 align:middle line:84%
"Hey, tell me about
your coma experience."

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.365 align:middle line:10%
>>PEARCE: I started telling
people about the things

00:45:26.365 --> 00:45:29.590 align:middle line:10%
I was discovering and sharing
my information with them.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:31.830 align:middle line:10%
And through that, people
are opening up to me

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:34.380 align:middle line:10%
and then telling me stories
that they never told their loved

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.138 align:middle line:10%
ones, never told a living soul.

00:45:36.138 --> 00:45:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They feel safe.

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And they
told me and my wife,

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:42.400 align:middle line:84%
because they want other
coma survivors to know.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:44.980 align:middle line:90%
Alan, thank you so much.

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for writing the book.

>>PEARCE: Thank
you for having me.

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:51.812 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, the title
of the book is "Coma--

00:45:51.812 --> 00:45:55.020 align:middle line:10%
A Near-death Experience,"
which is actually a gateway

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.690 align:middle line:10%
to the exploration of
consciousness for people who are

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.430 align:middle line:10%
hesitant to go directly
into the topic,

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:02.170 align:middle line:10%
whether a coma is
involved or not.

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on "Open Minds."
