00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.470 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Back in the 1980s,

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.260 align:middle line:10%
the world was shocked
by the emergence

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:10%
of a little known and
fatal disease called Ebola.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:84%
We read stories of people
bleeding from the inside

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.010 align:middle line:84%
out and dying within a
week of the first symptom.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.180 align:middle line:84%
After taking the lives of more
than 7,000 people globally

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.260 align:middle line:84%
recently, Ebola is said to be
on the forefront of threats

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.740 align:middle line:90%
to our public well being.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.720 align:middle line:84%
What's the current status
as far as the spread

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.440 align:middle line:90%
of Ebola geographically?

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
talk to my trusted

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.772 align:middle line:84%
friend and medical expert
Doc Hutton, Dr. James Hutton,

00:00:56.772 --> 00:00:58.480 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
look at this phenomena

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.220 align:middle line:84%
from a number of
different levels.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, you
live in Sedona as I do,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and when anyone in Sedona
has an issue that's complex,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.290 align:middle line:84%
everybody knows you
go to Doc Hutton.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.910 align:middle line:84%
So I want to first just get
down to one little thing

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.570 align:middle line:84%
that people don't understand,
and that is you're

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:90%
a naturopathic doctor.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So people don't understand
what naturopaths are.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.720 align:middle line:84%
They think they're an
herbologist or something.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit
about what it requires

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.590 align:middle line:84%
to become a naturopath and why
you did that, and then we're

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.427 align:middle line:84%
going to get off you and go
into the subject of Ebola.

00:01:30.427 --> 00:01:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. JAMES HUTTON:
Thank you, Regina.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.930 align:middle line:10%
Naturopathic medicine or
naturopathic physician

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.790 align:middle line:10%
actually is the way medicine
was practiced in America prior

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.420 align:middle line:10%
to the use and advent of
pharmaceuticals or chemicals

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.170 align:middle line:10%
and the synthesis
of these chemicals

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:10%
from active plant ingredients
and plant constituents.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Naturopathic medicine
as a physician,

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.770 align:middle line:84%
we're trained in the
use of air, light,

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.930 align:middle line:84%
water, as in hydrotherapy,
constitutional hydrotherapy,

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.220 align:middle line:84%
hot and cold, nutrition, of
course, and you said herbs.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.480 align:middle line:84%
We refer to them as botanicals
because botanical medicine,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.180 align:middle line:84%
I think, currently to
this time, about 70%

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:84%
of the people in the earth
still use botanicals or herbs

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.200 align:middle line:84%
as medicinals-- traditional
Chinese medicine,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.242 align:middle line:90%
many cultures.

00:02:16.242 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you still have
to go to medical school.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: Yes, that's the
other side of the coin.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.115 align:middle line:84%
Many people think that
we're either self-taught

00:02:25.115 --> 00:02:27.550 align:middle line:84%
or, I don't know,
hocus-pocus taught,

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:84%
whatever, but it's a four year
in-residence medical school

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:84%
that is comparable to any
of the schools in America

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:84%
as far as your basic
training-- anatomy,

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.890 align:middle line:84%
physiology,
biochemistry, pathology.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.290 align:middle line:84%
But it does change when we come
to therapeutics or treatment

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.077 align:middle line:84%
modalities, and I would
like to interject here

00:02:46.077 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
that we're taught--
I use the phrase--

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.850 align:middle line:90%
"both ways of medicine."

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.390 align:middle line:84%
We're taught what is done
for a particular disease

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.200 align:middle line:84%
entity in the conventional
allopathic system, MD system,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.630 align:middle line:84%
as well as what we would do
for it either botanically,

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.300 align:middle line:90%
homeopathically.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have the
entire toolbox at your disposal.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: Yes,
and in many states

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.280 align:middle line:84%
we're licensed to use
pharmaceuticals, antibiotics,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.015 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, if one chooses to.

00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:13.390 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
get into what I've

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:84%
done with my own
personal career,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and I found other therapies
that antibiotics are not

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:90%
exactly needed.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why did you, when you
were in residency and all that,

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.432 align:middle line:84%
what did you choose
to go this direction?

00:03:26.432 --> 00:03:28.015 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: That's a
very good question.

00:03:28.015 --> 00:03:30.940 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.740 align:middle line:84%
It was a soul
searching, if you will.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.280 align:middle line:84%
I felt that I could
help more people

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:90%
being a naturopathic physician.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:84%
My first love was in the
conventional hospital setting,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:90%
the surgery.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.980 align:middle line:84%
I spent about 15 to 20 years
in the conventional hospital

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.060 align:middle line:84%
setting not as a
doctor, but as a tech,

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.730 align:middle line:90%
and I really like surgery.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.060 align:middle line:84%
The human body, to
me, is a work of art,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.860 align:middle line:90%
and internally it's beautiful.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:90%
It's miraculous.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.770 align:middle line:84%
It may seem odd to some
people saying that,

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.802 align:middle line:90%
but it is and my viewpoint.

00:04:02.802 --> 00:04:04.760 align:middle line:84%
But I just felt I could
help a lot more people.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Because I would have done
reconstructive plastic surgery,

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:84%
but I'm happy I've
done what I've done.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.826 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to help
people that they would not

00:04:13.826 --> 00:04:14.950 align:middle line:90%
have gotten help otherwise.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.116 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's true.

00:04:16.116 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
why I say in town,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.269 align:middle line:84%
because in Sedona
a lot of people

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.620 align:middle line:84%
eschew allopathic
medicine in general,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and so they're looking for
something that can actually

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.350 align:middle line:84%
work, and so that's how they
end of at Doc Hutton's front

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.500 align:middle line:90%
door, so to speak.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.281 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go into the
whole notion of Ebola,

00:04:31.281 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to
talk to you about it

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.050 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people
watching right now also

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.790 align:middle line:84%
would prefer to find a way to
boost their own immune system

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.490 align:middle line:84%
naturally down the road, besides
being enlightened on what this

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.930 align:middle line:84%
is, how it came about, all the
different therapies that can

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.800 align:middle line:84%
counter it, not necessarily
going the allopathic route,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and also not leaving
themselves vulnerable to this.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.819 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, right
now you said, jeez,

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.610 align:middle line:84%
when I wrote this script
a couple weeks ago

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.950 align:middle line:90%
it was over 5,000.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.470 align:middle line:90%
Now it's over 7,000.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.060 align:middle line:84%
What is happening
geographically?

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Where is it spreading
at this point?

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: I check the
CDC website frequently.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.890 align:middle line:84%
That's the best barometer,
I guess we can say we have,

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and it appears it still seems
to be pretty much isolated

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:23.194 align:middle line:84%
to Africa-- Sierra Leone,
Mali, and the areas right

00:05:23.194 --> 00:05:24.110 align:middle line:90%
around in that region.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:90%


00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.436 align:middle line:84%
As we do know, there
are a couple cases

00:05:28.436 --> 00:05:29.310 align:middle line:90%
that have to America.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.230 align:middle line:84%
I think currently last statistic
I saw we've had four cases.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:84%
I want to say, I think,
three deaths, at that point.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.100 align:middle line:84%
But it does have the
potential, if it were to--

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:84%
I'll back up and
couch it in this way;

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.720 align:middle line:84%
the movie "Outbreak," an
old movie, I think back

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.860 align:middle line:84%
from the '80s or so, maybe early
'90s, it was very much similar,

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.820 align:middle line:90%
and it showed what could happen.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Not that I want people to
become frightened and get

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.070 align:middle line:84%
scared about this, but
the potential is there.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.740 align:middle line:84%
It seems at this point it is
being contained in Africa,

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.787 align:middle line:84%
and that will lead us into
what the CDC is doing.

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and that's
kind of where I wanted to go.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.340 align:middle line:84%
So I mean there have been
some complaints about the CDC

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.440 align:middle line:90%
across the board.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.400 align:middle line:84%
A lot of complaints about the
CDC and the way they've handled

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.730 align:middle line:90%
or not handled things.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.160 align:middle line:84%
On one hand, creating a bit
of a scare, on another hand,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.200 align:middle line:90%
totally downplaying.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And some would say it goes
even further than that.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.850 align:middle line:84%
So what is the CDCs role
technically, and what

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.760 align:middle line:90%
have they actually been doing?

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: OK, the CDCs
role, as you all may know,

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.350 align:middle line:84%
is to-- when they hear of these
events around the world that

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.040 align:middle line:84%
could potentially be
threatening to all of us,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.260 align:middle line:84%
isolate it, go in,
find out what is.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.400 align:middle line:84%
In this case they
know it's Ebola virus.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.290 align:middle line:84%
The primary things that
they're recommending to be done

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.960 align:middle line:84%
is-- the first is
classic isolation.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.520 align:middle line:84%
It appears from
historical documentation

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.590 align:middle line:84%
that the only way Ebola has
been stopped, if you will,

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.620 align:middle line:84%
is by quarantining,
isolation-- isolating

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
the patients, the communities,
the villages in this case,

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.060 align:middle line:90%
so that it can't spread.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And primarily, CDC is
just saying basic hygiene.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what we've
known since, I guess,

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Joseph Lister-- wash your hands.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Wear a mask.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Don't touch items that
the person has handled.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.690 align:middle line:84%
They say that you can touch a
few things, in the sense, maybe

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.361 align:middle line:90%
a cup, handing it to a person.

00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:37.110 align:middle line:84%
But they're saying
that it's not airborne,

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.940 align:middle line:84%
that it's only
blood, body fluids,

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, like drinking after
someone, caring for someone.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what if
someone were sneezing?

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.887 align:middle line:84%
Because that is still
particulate of droplets.

00:07:46.887 --> 00:07:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: The droplets-- and I'm
going to go back to the movie

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:90%
"Outbreak."

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:84%
It's got the single
best example.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Part of my training was
in respiratory therapy,

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and once you have respiratory
therapy, microbiology,

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and a few things--
when someone sneezes,

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.620 align:middle line:84%
you're very uncomfortable
because aside

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.760 align:middle line:84%
from what can be inside of our
lungs, in the case of Ebola,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:90%
it's what we breathe in.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.945 align:middle line:84%
We have these bacteria and
then things in our nose,

00:08:10.945 --> 00:08:12.340 align:middle line:90%
and it comes right back out.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.860 align:middle line:84%
But in the case of the
sneeze, if your close enough

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.770 align:middle line:84%
in proximity, and CDC
recommends being greater

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.650 align:middle line:84%
than three feet
away from someone,

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.490 align:middle line:84%
but if you're within
that three foot range,

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.031 align:middle line:84%
and they were to
sneeze, and you were

00:08:25.031 --> 00:08:27.430 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of an inhalation
and couldn't stop it,

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.930 align:middle line:84%
which most people aren't even
that conscious of what they're

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:84%
doing in that moment,
yes, you could inhale it.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:37.710 align:middle line:84%
CDC is saying that
it is not airborne.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.559 align:middle line:84%
We'll leave it at,
at this moment.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:43.274 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I know, I've
read varying reports on that.

00:08:43.274 --> 00:08:45.315 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: If it matters,
personal opinion, and it

00:08:45.315 --> 00:08:47.565 align:middle line:84%
is personal opinion based
upon, I guess you could say,

00:08:47.565 --> 00:08:50.710 align:middle line:84%
my experience as a physician
or being in the world,

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm not so convinced,
let's just say it that way,

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:57.050 align:middle line:84%
that it's not airborne or
the potential to be airborne.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.917 align:middle line:84%
It's an upper
respiratory infection.

00:08:58.917 --> 00:09:01.125 align:middle line:84%
That's one way it's being
looked at as well-- severe,

00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:84%
but respiratory, and we
all know that's airborne.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.115 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the flu, et
cetera, all these things

00:09:06.115 --> 00:09:09.470 align:middle line:90%
are airborne that we know of.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.850 align:middle line:84%
They're trying
to-- well, they're

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:16.550 align:middle line:84%
saying Ebola primarily-- direct
contact is what's being stated.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.750 align:middle line:84%
The health care workers
that have come back ill,

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.234 align:middle line:84%
we haven't had any
details on them.

00:09:20.234 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:84%
It would be interesting if we
could get firsthand accounts

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.130 align:middle line:84%
from them-- what they were
doing, where they were,

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.932 align:middle line:90%
and what they did.

00:09:26.932 --> 00:09:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about what Ebola

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:84%
is, because I mean I right
after this new outbreak of it,

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:84%
recent outbreak of it, I started
poking around on the internet,

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.920 align:middle line:84%
of course, and one
of the things that

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.260 align:middle line:84%
kept popping up in a lot
of articles coming through,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.915 align:middle line:84%
a lot of alternative
health sites

00:09:43.915 --> 00:09:49.920 align:middle line:84%
was this was essentially a
very rabid kind of scurvy,

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.360 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, first, what is scurvy?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying
that because it

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.140 align:middle line:84%
seems that vitamin
C has-- there's

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.120 align:middle line:84%
some defense with vitamin
C. So launch into this.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: OK, well,
the scurvy aspect, I've

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.034 align:middle line:84%
looked at that a little bit,
and I can't say I totally agree.

00:10:07.034 --> 00:10:08.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's only because
of the other information

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.130 align:middle line:90%
I've come across.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.340 align:middle line:84%
But the logic of the vitamin
C from what I can understand,

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.820 align:middle line:84%
or I could say, the vitamin
C aspect I could see,

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.170 align:middle line:84%
pun intended, that
vitamin C in the body

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.990 align:middle line:84%
does number of things-- boosting
immune system, the integrity

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.361 align:middle line:90%
of the tissue, if you will.

00:10:25.361 --> 00:10:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I look
that being important

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.943 align:middle line:84%
is that the mucous
membranes is where you're

00:10:28.943 --> 00:10:30.210 align:middle line:90%
going to get Ebola contact.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.188 align:middle line:84%
Mucous membrane being
friable or damaged,

00:10:32.188 --> 00:10:34.146 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be more
susceptible to any kind

00:10:34.146 --> 00:10:37.610 align:middle line:84%
of an infection
as well as Ebola.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:84%
The vitamin C in
high enough doses,

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and this is one
aspect that I haven't

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.060 align:middle line:84%
seen discussed in literature,
maybe it is there,

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.640 align:middle line:84%
but when we think
of Ebola, at least

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%
from a practitioner's
viewpoint, and using vitamin C

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:55.059 align:middle line:84%
I think of intravenous
vitamin C, into the vein.

00:10:55.059 --> 00:10:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
what I had read.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.380 align:middle line:84%
You can't really ingest
enough to make it work

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.090 align:middle line:90%
in something as severe as this.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: Right,
I agree with you.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Back to Linus
Pauling, for example,

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:10.430 align:middle line:84%
as far as oral vitamin C, Dr.
Pauling recommended, say, 10-

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.300 align:middle line:84%
to 15-, 20,000 grams
of vitamin C orally.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Most people cannot take
that much because it upsets

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:90%
the digestive tract.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.772 align:middle line:90%
We'll leave it at that.

00:11:18.772 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:84%
The standard rule of thumb
that I've used in practice

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.340 align:middle line:84%
is 1,000 milligrams
of vitamin C per hour

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.770 align:middle line:84%
during your waking
hours up to the point

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.670 align:middle line:84%
of getting loose stool
or irritation for bowel,

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.905 align:middle line:84%
and, at that point, you
subtract 1,000 milligrams,

00:11:31.905 --> 00:11:33.842 align:middle line:84%
and that's the dose
your body can absorb.

00:11:33.842 --> 00:11:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
everyone's different.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HUTTON: Everyone is different.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.680 align:middle line:84%
I've known a few
people, they can

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:84%
take a teaspoon of four, five
grams of vitamin C powder,

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.864 align:middle line:84%
dump it in a glass,
and drink it.

00:11:43.864 --> 00:11:44.530 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.747 align:middle line:90%
Most people can't do that.

00:11:46.747 --> 00:11:48.330 align:middle line:84%
With respect to doing
it intravenously

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:54.060 align:middle line:84%
in an IV situation
an IV bag solution,

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.200 align:middle line:84%
I would look at probably
using a minimum of 50 grams

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.612 align:middle line:90%
maybe, 25 to 50, minimum of 50.

00:12:01.612 --> 00:12:03.195 align:middle line:84%
I know some practitioners
have gone up

00:12:03.195 --> 00:12:06.580 align:middle line:84%
to 100 grams of
vitamin C. I'm not

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.830 align:middle line:90%
saying it's a bad thing to do.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:84%
I can see how it can
have potential to work.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.174 align:middle line:84%
The way I look at
it, though, is you're

00:12:12.174 --> 00:12:14.090 align:middle line:84%
having to drip this in
over a number of hours.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.110 align:middle line:90%
You can't run this in rapidly.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.540 align:middle line:90%
It can be damaging to the body.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
kind of effectiveness

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.122 align:middle line:84%
does it have intravenously
over running it

00:12:22.122 --> 00:12:23.330 align:middle line:90%
through the digestive system?

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: Running
it intravenously,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.550 align:middle line:84%
the body's able to get a
high enough concentration.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.990 align:middle line:84%
The biochemical
literature on vitamin C

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:84%
states that the
vitamin C pushes the,

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.350 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, the immune
system into more

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:40.160 align:middle line:84%
of an oxidative metabolic
pathway, so to speak,

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.340 align:middle line:84%
or oxidation within
the white blood cells.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Oxidation meaning making
peroxides and superoxides which

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:90%
is--

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.599 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Normally that
wouldn't be a good thing

00:12:49.599 --> 00:12:50.599 align:middle line:90%
in everyday life, right?

00:12:50.599 --> 00:12:53.223 align:middle line:84%
That's not something you want to
experience day in and day out,

00:12:53.223 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:84%
unless you're in
a situation that

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.420 align:middle line:90%
needs response of some kind?

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: The high
dose vitamin C?

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.613 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: No, you wouldn't want
have such high doses, correct.

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.060 align:middle line:84%
The peroxide and
superoxide just to clarify,

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.670 align:middle line:84%
within the white
blood cell, that

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:08.180 align:middle line:84%
is the normal way a white
blood cell-- we're all taught,

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.290 align:middle line:84%
I think, in science
or some classes

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.700 align:middle line:84%
that a white blood
cell or a macrophage

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.860 align:middle line:84%
engulfs an organism
or a bacterium.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And how does that
macrophage destroy it?

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:84%
It destroys it with peroxides,
superoxides-- superoxides

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:84%
are just very strong peroxides--
and hydrochloric acid.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.794 align:middle line:84%
And so the vitamin C enhances
that peroxidic reaction

00:13:31.794 --> 00:13:32.960 align:middle line:90%
within the white blood cell.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, I have a question
a little off topic,

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.330 align:middle line:84%
but there been times when I
used to run a lot, for example.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.760 align:middle line:84%
There were certain days when I
would be running and sweating

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:84%
that I felt like there was a
kind of a peroxide coming off

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.110 align:middle line:90%
of my skin.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:84%
What's happening when
we experience that?

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: There, I
think your body--

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.627 align:middle line:84%
in running we do go
into aerobic metabolism.

00:13:55.627 --> 00:13:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Initially, when we
start out running--

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.031 align:middle line:84%
I've had a number
of runner friends.

00:13:59.031 --> 00:14:00.447 align:middle line:84%
People will go,
well, the second--

00:14:00.447 --> 00:14:01.740 align:middle line:90%
they call it "second wind."

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.520 align:middle line:84%
We used to always
call it second wind.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And what I've come
to believe or see

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.830 align:middle line:84%
from biochemistry and physiology
is that what it actually

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.770 align:middle line:84%
is that we've warmed up the
biochemistry, if you will,

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.830 align:middle line:84%
in the body that our initial
running is more anaerobic type

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.780 align:middle line:84%
metabolism, like a sprinter's
metabolism, if you will.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Running distance, you're
in aerobic or oxidative

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.540 align:middle line:84%
metabolism, more like a
dancer, and i.e. you're

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:25.980 align:middle line:90%
the long distance runner.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.660 align:middle line:90%
And so that coming off the skin?

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.056 align:middle line:90%
Good question.

00:14:30.056 --> 00:14:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Would that mean that
something good's happening

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.520 align:middle line:90%
in the immune system or bad?

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: Well, I'm an ex-runner
at this point, we'll say.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.310 align:middle line:84%
I had a few injuries,
slowed me down a bit.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.660 align:middle line:84%
But I'm with you
in that respect.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that-- because
you have endorphins

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.106 align:middle line:84%
and a number of things
created, plus you're

00:14:48.106 --> 00:14:51.650 align:middle line:84%
in oxidative metabolism,
your immune system will be

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.220 align:middle line:90%
working at a much better rate.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I won't necessarily
say a higher rate.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.334 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes when you
say, oh, immune system's

00:14:57.334 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:84%
at a high rate, people tend
to misjudge that or view

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.350 align:middle line:84%
that as being, oh, I'm going
toward autoimmune disease.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not referring
to that at all,

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.950 align:middle line:84%
just a high functioning
immune system.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now
let's go back to Ebola.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.230 align:middle line:90%
What is Ebola then?

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.760 align:middle line:84%
We've already ruled out
it's not exactly scurvy,

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.014 align:middle line:84%
even though it could be enhanced
by intravenous vitamin C.

00:15:17.014 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: Correct,
and later on we

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:84%
will discuss other therapies
for this situation.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we will.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: Ebola is one of
the hemorrhagic fevers,

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:33.730 align:middle line:84%
At this point, there are five
different Ebola viruses, if you

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:39.130 align:middle line:90%
will, or family genus of Ebola.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.650 align:middle line:90%
The family is Filoviridae.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:47.810 align:middle line:84%
The particular genus
is just Ebola virus.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:50.725 align:middle line:84%
But the five that
are currently known,

00:15:50.725 --> 00:15:52.100 align:middle line:84%
and interestingly
enough, they're

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:56.280 align:middle line:84%
named after areas of where
they were found, Zaire,

00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:84%
one, the Congo, as well as
the Sudan, the Tai Forest

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.545 align:middle line:84%
and this other one is a
difficult to pronounce one.

00:16:06.545 --> 00:16:08.890 align:middle line:90%
I'll try to do my best at it.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:10.850 align:middle line:84%
It's Bundibugyo,
and I don't know

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:13.350 align:middle line:84%
where that is, but
it's in Africa as well,

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.610 align:middle line:90%
and then Reston.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:90%
These are all Ebola viruses.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the five of that
particular family.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And the Reston
virus or Ebola virus

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:84%
does not affect human primates
or humans and primates.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Basically, Ebola,
at this point, there

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:84%
is no known reservoir, if you
will, that seems to be known.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.840 align:middle line:84%
They're saying maybe bats
are the primary resident.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I read that.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.317 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: The fact they can't
quite find a single host--

00:16:43.317 --> 00:16:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --kind of natural
breeding ground of it.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.358 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: Right, it just
doesn't seem to exist.

00:16:47.358 --> 00:16:49.595 align:middle line:84%
But, at this point,
that is what we know in

00:16:49.595 --> 00:16:51.300 align:middle line:90%
that it's called as Ebola.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just these five different
viruses of the family.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and there's
more to that thought.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.160 align:middle line:84%
I've been reading
sites, and I know

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.089 align:middle line:84%
you have a lot more at
your fingertips than I do,

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:07.990 align:middle line:84%
that this is a, not necessarily
even a mutation-- natural

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:09.589 align:middle line:90%
mutation?

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:90%
>>HUTTON: Correct.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:11.755 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about it.

00:17:11.755 --> 00:17:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: OK, the other
thing with Ebola--

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:84%
the fact that it has no
natural host or reservoir

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:21.230 align:middle line:84%
at this point that's been found
does lead one to suspicion

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.369 align:middle line:84%
because it appears,
at least I'll

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:27.619 align:middle line:84%
just say in medical history,
that we pretty much always find

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:30.250 align:middle line:84%
a host of some sort for things
like this over the years.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.700 align:middle line:90%
It just has come up.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean even, I'll just
say, with HIV, for example

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.760 align:middle line:84%
the simian immunodeficiency
virus in the green monkey,

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.260 align:middle line:84%
seems to be some
connection there.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.870 align:middle line:90%
We'll get to that maybe later.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.720 align:middle line:90%
But it does seem to have hosts.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It did have an
origin, is the point, yes.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.650 align:middle line:84%
What happened after that
is a separate story.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:51.620 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying there isn't
even a "green monkey" here.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HUTTON: No, that's correct.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.280 align:middle line:84%
What we seem to have
here, if it's OK,

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I'll go in-- there's two other
viruses that are-- well, Ebola,

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.950 align:middle line:90%
you ask what it is?

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:04.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a hemorrhagic virus.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.550 align:middle line:90%
I think I mentioned that.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.300 align:middle line:90%
We have two others.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:11.880 align:middle line:84%
The Lassa Fever virus, which
these are all in Africa.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, I say all-- the one, the
last one I'm going to mention

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.180 align:middle line:84%
is out of Germany--
another story too.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.750 align:middle line:84%
But Lassa Fever affects about
500,000 people in Africa.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:26.780 align:middle line:84%
It's got about a
20% mortality rate,

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't really come in
to notice until about 1969.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:35.340 align:middle line:84%
There were two missionary
nurses who died from it.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.410 align:middle line:84%
That one was airborne, but what
was interesting about it is,

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.030 align:middle line:84%
they found that it seemed
to have connection between--

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mean to sound
too crude with this,

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:84%
but-- rat urine
and feces is where

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:90%
it was a host, if you will.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So that was a bit interesting in
the fact that it was airborne.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.600 align:middle line:90%
It's also hemorrhagic.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.210 align:middle line:90%
The other is the Marburg virus.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:58.642 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:18:58.642 --> 00:19:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is the
one out of Germany?

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.772 align:middle line:90%
>>HUTTON: Out of Germany, yes.

00:19:01.772 --> 00:19:04.355 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That doesn't seem like
a place that would be hosting

00:19:04.355 --> 00:19:05.080 align:middle line:90%
these--

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.121 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: I would have to
agree with you on that,

00:19:07.121 --> 00:19:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and just the facts
of it would lend one

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.257 align:middle line:84%
to come to that
logical conclusion.

00:19:12.257 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:84%
After a little bit of "Star
Trek," if we all think

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.580 align:middle line:90%
like Spock, logic dictates.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:21.620 align:middle line:84%
The Marburg virus
was in 1967, and it

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:84%
was an outbreak in the
laboratories in Marburg,

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.640 align:middle line:90%
Germany and Frankfurt, Germany.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.695 align:middle line:84%
And they thought-- they thought,
keyword "thought," not know,

00:19:31.695 --> 00:19:36.515 align:middle line:84%
no fact-- that this came
from some monkeys that

00:19:36.515 --> 00:19:40.250 align:middle line:84%
had been shipped to the
laboratories from Uganda.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.640 align:middle line:84%
The literature I came
across couldn't verify that,

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.635 align:middle line:84%
but it was referenced,
and this is known.

00:19:44.635 --> 00:19:47.330 align:middle line:84%
It's internationally known
that that's where it came from.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:51.235 align:middle line:84%
But the odd part about it is
that there wasn't much known

00:19:51.235 --> 00:19:51.735 align:middle line:90%
after that.

00:19:51.735 --> 00:19:53.706 align:middle line:84%
You didn't hear anything
about it until 1974,

00:19:53.706 --> 00:19:55.455 align:middle line:84%
and I haven't really
followed it because I

00:19:55.455 --> 00:19:58.604 align:middle line:84%
was looking for the Ebola
and whatever things.

00:19:58.604 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:84%
But then you come to
Ebola, and you're asking,

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.228 align:middle line:90%
is it a mutation?

00:20:01.228 --> 00:20:04.110 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:08.900 align:middle line:84%
The fact that Ebola,
as we know it,

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.750 align:middle line:84%
did not seem to exist
in medical literature

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:16.630 align:middle line:84%
or historical documentation
in Africa until about 1976.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Now what I'm about to say seems
a bit coincidental, we'll say.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, our audience
is very comfortable with

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:28.260 align:middle line:84%
coincidences and subtleties,
nuances of all kinds when it

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.270 align:middle line:90%
comes to this, so...

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: OK, well, basically
what happens is this; in 1976,

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:84%
in a little place called
Kenema-- K-E-N-E-M-A,

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.614 align:middle line:84%
Sierra Leone, Africa,
the US military built,

00:20:41.614 --> 00:20:44.030 align:middle line:84%
the army built-- the United
States Army's Medical Research

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Institute for Infectious
Diseases in Kenema.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:84%
It was after that that Ebola,
as we know it, seemed to pop out

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.480 align:middle line:90%
and began affecting people.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was this in Sierra
Leone, the first instances?

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: It was in
Sierra Leone-- of Ebola

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.320 align:middle line:90%
as we know it, yes.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Now many people are
going to ask why

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.320 align:middle line:84%
would the US military--
what, what, what?

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, without going into
great philosophical discussion

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:17.720 align:middle line:84%
on military mentality
or warring mentality,

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.860 align:middle line:84%
the US military wanted
a biological weapon

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.330 align:middle line:84%
that would basically
bring about death

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:25.020 align:middle line:90%
and destruction of an enemy.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Efficiently
and quickly.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HUTTON: Extremely
efficiently and quickly, yes.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you're looking
at the incubation time,

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.250 align:middle line:84%
maximum 21 days,
although we're being

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:38.030 align:middle line:84%
told it's between 2
and 10 and 8 to 10 days

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:84%
of symptoms appearing
in incubation,

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.830 align:middle line:90%
so that's fairly quickly.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to
go back to this thing,

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:51.680 align:middle line:84%
this military facility,
research facility,

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.390 align:middle line:90%
because that is coincidental.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:58.340 align:middle line:84%
The first instances break
out once they're already

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.400 align:middle line:84%
beginning to look at,
engineer, work with something

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.790 align:middle line:84%
at that facility, and
they're in the market

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:09.280 align:middle line:84%
for biological weapons, so
that's very interesting.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's just for a moment
to talk about what

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.297 align:middle line:84%
happens once a person
contracts Ebola, how it works

00:22:15.297 --> 00:22:16.880 align:middle line:84%
in the body, what
starts breaking down

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.280 align:middle line:90%
that it happens so quickly.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.790 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: The first symptoms
that we seem to see

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:84%
are high fever, severe headache,
fatigue, severe weakness,

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:34.610 align:middle line:84%
many times-- nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, stomach pain.

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:37.104 align:middle line:84%
Now, if folks that
are listening,

00:22:37.104 --> 00:22:38.645 align:middle line:84%
those things I've
just stated sound--

00:22:38.645 --> 00:22:39.930 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: --like the flu.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: --the flu,
exactly, every day.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:44.880 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
that comes in here

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:51.062 align:middle line:84%
is abnormal bleeding
or something odd.

00:22:51.062 --> 00:22:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Someone having the
flu and bleeding

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.660 align:middle line:90%
would be odd to any of us.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.691 align:middle line:84%
But once the progression
goes beyond--

00:22:56.691 --> 00:22:58.440 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Where do they
start bleeding from?

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.330 align:middle line:90%
How does the bleeding show?

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.906 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Upper respiratory,
eyes, ears can be,

00:23:02.906 --> 00:23:04.780 align:middle line:84%
but mostly, it's upper
respiratory because it

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:90%
effects the lung tissue.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So they're coughing,
and there's a lot of blood.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:08.146 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: Mm-hmm.

00:23:08.146 --> 00:23:08.646 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:23:08.646 --> 00:23:12.670 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Most people,
interestingly enough,

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.260 align:middle line:84%
from what I've read
and have come across,

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.380 align:middle line:84%
don't die from
the bleeding, even

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:19.690 align:middle line:90%
though we think it would be.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:23.665 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly from
dehydration because of the,

00:23:23.665 --> 00:23:25.810 align:middle line:90%
I guess, vomiting, diarrhea.

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:27.690 align:middle line:90%
You lose all your electrolytes.

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So you're asking earlier about
CDC-- one of the things they're

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:35.810 align:middle line:84%
doing in the places in Africa
is oral electrolyte replacement

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:39.790 align:middle line:84%
or drinking fluids that have
electrolytes, and it's OK.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:40.757 align:middle line:90%
It's acceptable.

00:23:40.757 --> 00:23:42.590 align:middle line:84%
The World Health
Organization many years ago

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.540 align:middle line:90%
put together a formula.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:48.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if it's acceptable using
a trade name that we all know,

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Gatorade, which is for
electrolyte replacement--

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.430 align:middle line:84%
not quite sufficient, I
don't think in volume.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:56.940 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Very low dosage, yeah.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Very low-- but the
World Health Organization

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.890 align:middle line:84%
put out a formula some years
ago that is just very simple--

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:05.860 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of baking
soda, a little bit

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:09.910 align:middle line:84%
of what's called new salt or
the potassium chloride salt,

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:12.930 align:middle line:84%
and obviously sea
salt or regular salt,

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:16.642 align:middle line:84%
and water, and a little bit
of some type of sweetener.

00:24:16.642 --> 00:24:18.850 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Potassium, sodium,
and some kind of glucose--

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:19.480 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: The electrolytes.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:19.840 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.615 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: And just for the
audience that would know,

00:24:21.615 --> 00:24:23.390 align:middle line:84%
is that the reason
you have to put sugar,

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.940 align:middle line:84%
or you want to put glucose,
is that the way our body works

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.210 align:middle line:84%
physiologically,
biochemically is that we all

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:33.520 align:middle line:84%
know insulin is
important for our health

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.770 align:middle line:90%
and our well being and living.

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
is insulin attaches

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.740 align:middle line:84%
to a glucose molecule,
which in turn attaches

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.750 align:middle line:84%
to anything and everything else
that needs to go into the cell.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.340 align:middle line:84%
The insulin's the key that
takes it into the cell.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.841 align:middle line:84%
That's why you need
to have glucose.

00:24:46.841 --> 00:24:48.465 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So it has to
bond with glucose.

00:24:48.465 --> 00:24:51.210 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Correct, and actually to
rehydrate someone more rapidly,

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:53.710 align:middle line:84%
giving them a sweetener, a
sugar-- it has to be sugar.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:56.120 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be like any of
the Stevia, Sweet'n Low,

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:56.690 align:middle line:90%
any of that.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:57.331 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: It has to be real sugar.

00:24:57.331 --> 00:24:59.455 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: It has to be real
glucose, real sugar, yes.

00:24:59.455 --> 00:25:02.090 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: OK, so then,
this is leading

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:08.260 align:middle line:84%
me to ask the question, the
30% that supposedly survive--

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:12.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, last I read it
was a 70% fatality rate.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Is the 30% percent due to
the fact that they didn't

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.727 align:middle line:90%
dehydrate more or less than?

00:25:17.727 --> 00:25:19.810 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: That's something
that doesn't seem to have

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.420 align:middle line:90%
been elucidated at this point.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they're
saying it's because they

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.410 align:middle line:90%
haven't dehydrated.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:28.385 align:middle line:84%
But like with any
illness, I think we--

00:25:28.385 --> 00:25:30.910 align:middle line:84%
I'll use the phrase
"biochemical individuality,"

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.830 align:middle line:84%
or we're all individually
physiologically, biochemically,

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:36.730 align:middle line:84%
genetically to some degree,
that we have ability

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.940 align:middle line:90%
to fight these things off.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.100 align:middle line:84%
I think once one learns how
the immune system functions

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and what it's capable
of doing, it gives one

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:48.470 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more security,
knowing we're better equipped

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:49.890 align:middle line:84%
to take care of
things than we've been

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:50.440 align:middle line:90%
lead to believe to some degree.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.250 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that brings
up another question;

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.420 align:middle line:84%
what if the person
were being hydrated

00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:01.320 align:middle line:84%
through intravenous
assistance, could that

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.510 align:middle line:90%
help them survive it?

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.630 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Yes, that's one of the
things that they're-- well,

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:10.470 align:middle line:84%
with respect to CDCs-- if
you go to their website,

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:84%
there really is no
specific treatment.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.473 align:middle line:90%
They have the treatment section.

00:26:13.473 --> 00:26:16.749 align:middle line:84%
And all the treatment section
basically says is hydration.

00:26:16.749 --> 00:26:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Intravenous fluids, of
course, are the best

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.420 align:middle line:84%
in this case because the
people are, in most cases,

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.452 align:middle line:84%
not physically capable
of drinking or--

00:26:23.452 --> 00:26:25.160 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Absolutely
with electrolytes, all

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.580 align:middle line:90%
the electrolytes in glucose.

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.080 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Well, that,
and I'm not sure

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.339 align:middle line:84%
that someone, unless
you were-- I mean,

00:26:30.339 --> 00:26:32.130 align:middle line:84%
if you've got nausea
and vomiting going on,

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:34.864 align:middle line:84%
you can't drink enough liquid
electrolytes and keep it down.

00:26:34.864 --> 00:26:36.530 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: But I mean
you could in the bag.

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:37.500 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: IV wouldn't
be a problem.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.850 align:middle line:84%
A person, obviously, doesn't
even have to be conscious.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:41.802 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: But 70% of
the people are dying,

00:26:41.802 --> 00:26:43.760 align:middle line:84%
and we're Sierra Leone
and other countries that

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.450 align:middle line:84%
don't necessarily have
medical facilities that

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:49.090 align:middle line:84%
can accommodate that many
people ill at one time, right?

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: That is
correct, and the problem

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:55.820 align:middle line:84%
is getting the supplies to them,
getting enough fluids there.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I know in America right now
that it's been for probably six

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.030 align:middle line:84%
to eight months, maybe
possibly going on 10 months,

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:05.410 align:middle line:84%
that, I'll say,
practitioners that

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:08.055 align:middle line:84%
do IV therapies in
their offices have not

00:27:08.055 --> 00:27:09.180 align:middle line:90%
been able to get IV fluids.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.980 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: I was going
to ask you about that.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:14.160 align:middle line:90%
This is wrong.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.710 align:middle line:90%
Something's wrong.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Since when can-- I
mean, you're talking

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:20.910 align:middle line:84%
about people like yourself,
licensed medical professionals.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:25.490 align:middle line:84%
You can't get saline
solution even?

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.860 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: No, up until about,
and I'm going to say,

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.780 align:middle line:84%
roughly August, September,
veterinarians could get fluids,

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:32.820 align:middle line:90%
but now they can't.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And well, when you look
at it, the only people

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:40.000 align:middle line:84%
use fluids in the office are
practitioners, alternative,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.500 align:middle line:84%
call them what you
will, but that do

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.210 align:middle line:90%
IV therapies in their offices.

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:45.475 align:middle line:84%
Conventional MDs do not
do them in their offices.

00:27:45.475 --> 00:27:47.184 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: No, that
happens in the hospital.

00:27:47.184 --> 00:27:49.349 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Exactly, that's the
only place that happens.

00:27:49.349 --> 00:27:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Hospitals can get
fluids, not a problem.

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.260 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So, for allopathic
medicine, no problem.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.680 align:middle line:90%
You can get your fluids.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:59.035 align:middle line:84%
But veterinarians and
naturopathic physicians

00:27:59.035 --> 00:28:00.540 align:middle line:90%
and others cannot?

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:01.420 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: Correct.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.930 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: But this
doesn't make sense.

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Why would you have a shortage
of bags of sterilized water,

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:07.280 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.900 align:middle line:90%
Or saline solution?

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.950 align:middle line:84%
How is that possible
to have a shortage?

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.800 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Well, I'd like to
put this in perspective

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.790 align:middle line:90%
for people, if you don't mind.

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.820 align:middle line:84%
When you mention
saline, saline-- 0.9%

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.810 align:middle line:84%
salt water, the same
salinity as the blood.

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.170 align:middle line:84%
I haven't checked, but it's
pretty close to the same

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:25.770 align:middle line:90%
as the ocean water.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.190 align:middle line:90%
Earth's 7/8 ocean water.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:29.614 align:middle line:90%
Why can't we get saline?

00:28:29.614 --> 00:28:30.780 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good question.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have a
definitive, concrete answer.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.590 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: But as of
last August-- OK,

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:40.000 align:middle line:90%
when did Ebola first break out?

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm just thinking now.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm just thinking, trying
to connect some dots.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:46.790 align:middle line:84%
When did we-- it was a
few months ago, right?

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.950 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Yes, it was--
maybe three, give or take.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:51.250 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: OK, so,
all right, so that

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.427 align:middle line:84%
was around that time,
roughly around that time.

00:28:53.427 --> 00:28:55.760 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Fluids from before
that, they couldn't get them.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.968 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Couldn't get the
fluids right about that time

00:28:57.968 --> 00:28:58.660 align:middle line:90%
or just before?

00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.430 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: Right.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I could throw something
in here that, we'll say,

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:11.800 align:middle line:84%
coincidental is that if you
look at Ebola being a virus,

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:18.875 align:middle line:84%
you go back to the flu
epidemic, World War 1917, 1918.

00:29:18.875 --> 00:29:21.000 align:middle line:84%
I cannot quote this doctor's
name-- I wish I could.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.390 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't find the reference.

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:24.600 align:middle line:84%
It's anecdotal, but it's
true, of a physician

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.120 align:middle line:84%
on the East coast who had
about 25, 30 patients or so

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.490 align:middle line:84%
that had the H-5, as they say,
H-5N1, bird flu, Spanish bird

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:37.090 align:middle line:84%
flu, whatever, that were all--
I think back then the mortality

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:39.980 align:middle line:84%
rate for that Spanish flu was,
what, 70% to 90% or something?

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.290 align:middle line:90%
It was very high.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:46.420 align:middle line:10%
And he just gave intravenous
hydrogen peroxide

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.040 align:middle line:10%
to all of these patients,
and they all lived.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, looking at that,
somebody would say, well,

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:55.490 align:middle line:84%
that's-- I mean, I worked in the
conventional hospital setting

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:56.240 align:middle line:90%
for many years.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.614 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: But you just talked
about vitamin C and the cycle

00:29:58.614 --> 00:30:00.980 align:middle line:84%
of what it does, so we've
had a little primer for this.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.920 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: OK, good,
now, I'm not opposed

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.760 align:middle line:84%
to using vitamin C. I
want to make that clear.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.487 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the
other therapies

00:30:08.487 --> 00:30:10.445 align:middle line:84%
we're going to mention,
and peroxide's a very--

00:30:10.445 --> 00:30:11.390 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: It's less
efficient, less direct.

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:12.630 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Exactly,
it's less direct.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.330 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So let's talk about just
going direct with the hydrogen

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:16.970 align:middle line:90%
peroxide.

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:19.560 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: A standard
intravenous-- I

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.260 align:middle line:84%
trained with Dr. Charlie
Farr, a number of years back,

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.680 align:middle line:84%
that had put together
the peroxide protocols.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Farr was PhD,
biochemistry MD.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And we know that the white
blood cells use these peroxides.

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:36.186 align:middle line:84%
And so the logic is that and
what Dr. Farr hypothesized

00:30:36.186 --> 00:30:39.149 align:middle line:84%
is that the body works on
a hydrogen peroxide pool.

00:30:39.149 --> 00:30:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Not that there's this
literal pool sitting there,

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:42.885 align:middle line:84%
but the body pulls
the extra oxygen out

00:30:42.885 --> 00:30:46.560 align:middle line:84%
of the system that
makes the peroxides.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.702 align:middle line:84%
When using peroxide
directly, I like

00:30:50.702 --> 00:30:52.660 align:middle line:84%
to look at it as you're
just directly enhancing

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.418 align:middle line:84%
what the body already
need and is using.

00:30:54.418 --> 00:30:56.668 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So what kind of
percentage in a bag of fluids,

00:30:56.668 --> 00:30:57.640 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.870 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: The standard
formulation that Dr. Farr used

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:05.790 align:middle line:90%
and had promoted was 0.03%.

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.280 align:middle line:84%
That would be
300ths of a percent.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.520 align:middle line:84%
What we buy in the store
is 3%, and, by the way,

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.580 align:middle line:84%
what we get in the store
cannot be used because--

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.760 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: No, it's not food grade.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.420 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: No, it has excipients--
other things, fillers and such

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.990 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:20.105 align:middle line:90%
Food grade can be used.

00:31:20.105 --> 00:31:22.630 align:middle line:90%


00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:25.380 align:middle line:84%
With anything going
in intravenously,

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.930 align:middle line:84%
it needs to be, number
one, sterile of course,

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:30.100 align:middle line:90%
and free of particulate matter.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So many practitioners
would filter it

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:34.490 align:middle line:84%
with a 0.22 micron
filter, which is

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:37.190 align:middle line:84%
a standard filter
in the industry,

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:38.530 align:middle line:90%
to make sure it's sterile.

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:42.500 align:middle line:84%
But by adding the peroxide in,
a classic, what Dr. Farr taught

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.800 align:middle line:84%
was a 500 cc bag, either
saline or dextrose.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.320 align:middle line:84%
He preferred dextrose,
sugar water, D5W,

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.510 align:middle line:90%
and the 0.3% solution in that.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:54.205 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And that
basically wiped it out?

00:31:54.205 --> 00:31:55.390 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: Mm-hmm.

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:56.390 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: The Spanish flu?

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.192 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: The Spanish
flu-- I don't know.

00:31:58.192 --> 00:31:59.650 align:middle line:84%
That's the one
interesting thing is

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:02.000 align:middle line:84%
that I've not been able to
find the hard copy to read

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.500 align:middle line:90%
it myself.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.124 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to folks
that have seen it,

00:32:04.124 --> 00:32:06.240 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know that
the reference was

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.360 align:middle line:84%
there of what concentration
the doctor used in that era,

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.600 align:middle line:90%
in 1918, 1917.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.790 align:middle line:90%
But obviously, it worked.

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.530 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: But the protocol
today, with the standard,

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:15.779 align:middle line:90%
would be like, you say, 0.03%.

00:32:15.779 --> 00:32:17.190 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: --0.03%.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:21.690 align:middle line:84%
The only, I wouldn't say
difficulty, but using peroxide,

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:25.450 align:middle line:84%
you want to run it in
relatively slowly because it

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:31.500 align:middle line:84%
is an oxidizing agent, and it
can damage the injection site.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.180 align:middle line:84%
If you run it in too rapidly,
it will damage the vein wall.

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.890 align:middle line:84%
It'll come back
in a month's time,

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:40.090 align:middle line:84%
but if you just run in
like, say, a 500 cc bag,

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:41.614 align:middle line:90%
I would do it two hours maybe.

00:32:41.614 --> 00:32:42.530 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Two hours, OK.

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:44.410 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Maybe two, a
little more-- to me,

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:46.118 align:middle line:84%
it's better to run it
a little bit slower

00:32:46.118 --> 00:32:48.240 align:middle line:84%
and protect the vein
from the standpoint

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.780 align:middle line:84%
that if this is a
one-time situation,

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's life threatening, and
you have to run it in rapidly,

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.990 align:middle line:90%
that would be one thing.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:59.130 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: If you have the
luxury of a couple hours--

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:02.100 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: And then you can follow
up the next day or the day

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.560 align:middle line:84%
after because the
vein, that site,

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.210 align:middle line:84%
would still be usable and
accessible in a few days.

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:08.634 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Have you used
hydrogen peroxide therapy?

00:33:08.634 --> 00:33:11.050 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Yes, I was fortunate
to get to train with Dr. Farr

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:12.060 align:middle line:90%
before he passed away.

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:16.200 align:middle line:84%
I trained with him in 1993, I
think, went to his workshops,

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.074 align:middle line:84%
and I've used peroxide
since that time.

00:33:18.074 --> 00:33:19.740 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And what kind
of things have you

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.000 align:middle line:90%
used it on and to what effect?

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.350 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: I've used it
on many conditions.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:31.140 align:middle line:84%
I didn't use it directly for
conditions, if you will-- say,

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.680 align:middle line:84%
the way you would use, say, an
antibiotic for strep throat.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.590 align:middle line:84%
I used the peroxide
from the standpoint

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:38.760 align:middle line:84%
from it's oxidative
characteristics

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.040 align:middle line:84%
of adding oxygen
into the system,

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.630 align:middle line:84%
a way of getting
oxygen in the system,

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:45.454 align:middle line:84%
and enhancing immune function,
primarily is how I've done it.

00:33:45.454 --> 00:33:46.480 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Which kind of
works across the board

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.360 align:middle line:84%
then if you have any kind
of bugs floating around.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.151 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Yes, I guess
you'd say I've used it

00:33:50.151 --> 00:33:56.370 align:middle line:84%
more as a general enhancement,
working with biochemistry

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:58.600 align:middle line:90%
as well as immune, both ways.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:03.420 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: OK, so back to
this timing in this.

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:06.470 align:middle line:84%
To me, this phenomena
makes no sense

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:08.870 align:middle line:84%
of not being able to
get bags of saline,

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:11.624 align:middle line:84%
not being able to even
get sterilized water?

00:34:11.624 --> 00:34:12.290 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: Correct.

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:14.909 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: You can't
get sterilized water?

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:16.110 align:middle line:90%
Now this is odd.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:17.800 align:middle line:90%
Nor veterinarians?

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.520 align:middle line:84%
It almost makes--
I mean, now this

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:23.250 align:middle line:84%
is my suspicious conspiratorial
part of my mind, which

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:28.730 align:middle line:84%
is if you throw the vets
in too, the veterinarians

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.409 align:middle line:84%
into the inability
to procure this,

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:34.300 align:middle line:84%
then it doesn't look
like it's targeted

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.493 align:middle line:90%
at alternative medicine.

00:34:35.493 --> 00:34:36.159 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: Correct.

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:37.230 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Is that correct?

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:38.752 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: I agree with you.

00:34:38.752 --> 00:34:39.460 align:middle line:90%
It seems logical.

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.699 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And this cruel
because of all our animals

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:44.199 align:middle line:84%
then suffer as a result,
too, as a side effect.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:46.540 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: As a side effect.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Adding a little more
cynicism to this--

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:49.959 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: You can.

00:34:49.959 --> 00:34:51.250 align:middle line:90%
I want to know what's going on.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:52.458 align:middle line:90%
This just doesn't make sense.

00:34:52.458 --> 00:34:53.139 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: I agree.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I don't
look at it cynically.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.050 align:middle line:84%
I look at it just at
face value, and it's

00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:02.580 align:middle line:84%
like from a logic viewpoint
that if you had an outbreak, be

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:07.430 align:middle line:84%
it the bird flu, anything
that was a pandemic epidemic,

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:09.610 align:middle line:84%
in a case like the Ebola,
it's life-threatening,

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:14.080 align:middle line:84%
and it's terrifying to most
people that you could simply--

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.970 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to use the
slang we use in the hospital--

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.370 align:middle line:90%
hang a bag of fluids them.

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:19.480 align:middle line:90%
You just hang fluids.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.850 align:middle line:90%
That's what everybody says.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you had a community
and you had 150 cases of people

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.510 align:middle line:90%
that you suspect Ebola.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, rather than worrying
about doing some type of testing

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.330 align:middle line:90%
to document it's Ebola--

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:33.705 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Just get
the bag on them.

00:35:33.705 --> 00:35:36.482 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Just hang a bag
of peroxide on them.

00:35:36.482 --> 00:35:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's the flu or not,
it's going to help them.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:40.330 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And theoretically,
with that kind of virus,

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:41.090 align:middle line:90%
it should wipe it out.

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:41.470 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: It would.

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:41.890 align:middle line:90%
It should.

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:42.410 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: It would wipe it out.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:43.877 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: Yes, and the--

00:35:43.877 --> 00:35:44.960 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: And this is cheap.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.960 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Very cheap-- I couldn't
quite sit here and calculate,

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:52.180 align:middle line:84%
but let's put it
this way, if you

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:55.530 align:middle line:84%
were to buy the peroxide
from a compounding pharmacy,

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:57.720 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be more
costly, which I'm not saying,

00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.303 align:middle line:90%
don't do that.

00:35:58.303 --> 00:36:00.060 align:middle line:84%
That's what I did
for many, many years.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:03.840 align:middle line:84%
You could also take either
the food grade peroxide

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and filter it, as I
mentioned, and dilute it.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:11.410 align:middle line:84%
To make a 3% solution,
it's a one in 11 dilution.

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:13.150 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't matter
what volume you use.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:16.700 align:middle line:84%
1, 11 is your dilution
that will give you 3%.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.830 align:middle line:84%
At one point, I had 55
gallons of food grade

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:23.695 align:middle line:84%
for cleaning
purposes, and this was

00:36:23.695 --> 00:36:27.500 align:middle line:84%
when the scare of the flu,
a number of years back.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And we calculated out that
if I took that 55 gallons

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and made it into
3%, we'd come out

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:39.520 align:middle line:84%
with about enough 3% peroxide
to treat about 250,000 people.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And that volume of peroxide,
I think back, 55 gallons

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:44.240 align:middle line:90%
cost about $1,000.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.519 align:middle line:90%
So it'd be dirt cheap.

00:36:45.519 --> 00:36:46.310 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Dirt cheap.

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:47.654 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: Dirt cheap.

00:36:47.654 --> 00:36:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Now the one thing I
do want to add here,

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.444 align:middle line:84%
we were talking-- I hope
it's not an improper place

00:36:51.444 --> 00:36:55.560 align:middle line:84%
to interject this--
about the potential

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.990 align:middle line:84%
or the coincidence of the Army's
biological weapons station

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:03.660 align:middle line:90%
in Sierra Leone.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Lynn Horowitz wrote a book,
"AIDS and Ebola-- Emerging

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Viruses," and in
this, it's documented

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:15.440 align:middle line:84%
that in the back of
this book are copies

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.960 align:middle line:84%
of defense contracts
between Litton Corporation

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and the Department of Defense,
with none other than Robert,

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.836 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's, Robert
Gallo and Duesberg were

00:37:26.836 --> 00:37:28.960 align:middle line:84%
the principal investigators
for Litton Corporation.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.747 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen the copy,
I've had the book.

00:37:30.747 --> 00:37:32.080 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: And what does this mean?

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.560 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Well, it's
basically saying

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.180 align:middle line:84%
the Department of Defense
requested from Litton and Gallo

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:39.130 align:middle line:84%
and Duesberg to
make a virus that

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:42.450 align:middle line:84%
attacks the human immune
system, and they did it.

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:46.890 align:middle line:84%
That was, I want to say, either
'67 or somewhere in there,

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:48.310 align:middle line:90%
and it's real.

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:50.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've seen
the documents myself.

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:51.425 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm just
trying to say is

00:37:51.425 --> 00:37:55.050 align:middle line:84%
that this would not be
the first time with Ebola

00:37:55.050 --> 00:38:00.200 align:middle line:84%
that it appears someone within
our military-industrial complex

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.350 align:middle line:84%
has engaged in biological
weapons that have the potential

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:06.835 align:middle line:84%
to be unleashed on the
population accidentally

00:38:06.835 --> 00:38:09.080 align:middle line:90%
or on purpose.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.360 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And maybe,
I'm just saying maybe,

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.500 align:middle line:84%
this differs from
AIDS in the sense--

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and now this is just hearsay--
one older gentleman I knew,

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:22.180 align:middle line:84%
who was a doctor, who also
worked with the intelligence

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:26.820 align:middle line:84%
community, was stationed in
Stanleyville in the early days

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and said it wasn't
necessarily engineered.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.380 align:middle line:84%
The AIDS wasn't
necessarily engineered,

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.810 align:middle line:84%
but they knew what
was going on in

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:38.692 align:middle line:90%
and made no attempt to stop it.

00:38:38.692 --> 00:38:40.400 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: The information
I've come across,

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:45.500 align:middle line:84%
if it's acceptable to
state, that yes, you

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:50.540 align:middle line:84%
could say that HIV or the HIV,
Human Immunodeficiency Virus,

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:54.770 align:middle line:84%
was made, was not
manufactured per se

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:57.920 align:middle line:84%
because my understanding of
what I've come across and read,

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.860 align:middle line:84%
the way it's made,
if you will-- we've

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:05.560 align:middle line:84%
used in America green
monkey or kidney tissue

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.590 align:middle line:84%
as standard culture media
for a number of years.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:10.430 align:middle line:90%
That's common knowledge.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, the particular, this
monkey has in its system,

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Simian Immunodeficiency
Virus, as long

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:21.340 align:middle line:84%
as the animal is kept
in its natural habitat

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and is not stressed,
the virus does not

00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:28.600 align:middle line:84%
express itself and call untoward
effects within the primate.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.330 align:middle line:84%
You bring that animal out of
its habitat, i.e. stress it,

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:33.540 align:middle line:90%
or let's just be blunt--

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.370 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Which they
did when they had them

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:37.010 align:middle line:90%
in the research facilities.

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:39.330 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Well, let's just look
at how they're captured--

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:41.010 align:middle line:84%
either shoot them
with a dart gun,

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:44.774 align:middle line:84%
or native peoples just trap
them, throw them in a cage--

00:39:44.774 --> 00:39:45.815 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Very high stress.

00:39:45.815 --> 00:39:47.440 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: --put them
on a boat, airplane,

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.050 align:middle line:84%
fly them whatever
thousands of miles,

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and you're in a
research laboratory.

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And probably within,
what, 48 hours,

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:54.980 align:middle line:84%
you go from being in
your natural home,

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:59.005 align:middle line:84%
eating your natural vegetation
into a sterile metal

00:39:59.005 --> 00:40:00.130 align:middle line:90%
environment that you have--

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:01.421 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Terrifying environment.

00:40:01.421 --> 00:40:02.990 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Terrifying--
at that point,

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:04.940 align:middle line:90%
the virus expresses itself.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.940 align:middle line:84%
All that needs to be done
is harvest the kidneys

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:10.050 align:middle line:84%
at that point, make
the tissue culture.

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Then you bring in
bovine leukemia virus,

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:14.580 align:middle line:84%
bovine as we all
know, meaning cow.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.900 align:middle line:84%
The bovine leukemia
virus-- and then you

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.600 align:middle line:90%
bring in visna sheep virus.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Visna sheep virus is
native to Iceland,

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:25.139 align:middle line:84%
and it's what causes the slang
term "brain rot" in sheep.

00:40:25.139 --> 00:40:27.180 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Why would you be
bringing these things in

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:28.754 align:middle line:90%
to begin with, for what use?

00:40:28.754 --> 00:40:31.170 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: When you combine--
this is the interesting tidbit.

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:35.230 align:middle line:84%
When you combine the bovine
leukemia with the visna sheep

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:39.790 align:middle line:84%
virus on the kidney tissue
culture, the bovine leukemia

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and the visna sheep, if I'm
not mistaken, are retroviruses.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, they go in, take
the RNA transcriptase,

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:50.910 align:middle line:84%
take the DNA within
the kidney tissue,

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:54.070 align:middle line:84%
and restructure themselves,
replicate themselves.

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:55.776 align:middle line:84%
And what you wind up
after growing this

00:40:55.776 --> 00:40:58.730 align:middle line:84%
on that tissue,
the culture media,

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:01.090 align:middle line:84%
is you have a virus that's
a combination between all

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:01.830 align:middle line:90%
these three.

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:04.010 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And so you
create your autoimmune--

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:08.170 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Correct, that's what's
considered the HIV virus.

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And I wish I could give
you, other than, I think,

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.349 align:middle line:84%
Lynn Horowitz's book is
the single best reference.

00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:14.390 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah, I think so.

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:15.360 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to find.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.340 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: It is.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:17.040 align:middle line:90%
I have a copy.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.630 align:middle line:84%
It's in storage at
the moment, but I

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:20.213 align:middle line:84%
haven't come across
anything else that

00:41:20.213 --> 00:41:23.850 align:middle line:84%
discusses the bovine
leukemia and visna viruses.

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:25.950 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So what might
know, if we progressed this

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:29.760 align:middle line:84%
to the military installations
in Sierra Leone and Ebola,

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.680 align:middle line:84%
what might they have--
I mean, does anyone

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.263 align:middle line:84%
know what they might
have been working

00:41:33.263 --> 00:41:37.532 align:middle line:84%
with to perhaps even manufacture
what we are now calling Ebola?

00:41:37.532 --> 00:41:38.990 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: The closest
thing I've been

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:40.989 align:middle line:84%
able to come up with and
see is that some people

00:41:40.989 --> 00:41:43.820 align:middle line:84%
are saying that it appears it
was a manipulation of the Lassa

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Fever virus because of the
hemorrhagic aspects of Lassa

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:47.220 align:middle line:90%
Fever.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.365 align:middle line:84%
So unless I can find
other references,

00:41:49.365 --> 00:41:50.740 align:middle line:84%
I would have to
leave it at that,

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and it does seem
to make some sense.

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:55.150 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: OK, so we've
talked about the hydrogen

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:57.390 align:middle line:84%
peroxide, vitamin C, but
there are other things that

00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:00.230 align:middle line:84%
can be done too, and I know
you use some very interesting--

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and we've talked
about the inability

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:07.260 align:middle line:84%
for alternative physicians
to be able to get

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:11.600 align:middle line:84%
any saline solution, any
purified water, no means

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.370 align:middle line:84%
of being able to distribute
to an ill population

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.680 align:middle line:84%
any of these alternative,
highly effective,

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.829 align:middle line:90%
and inexpensive therapies.

00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:18.370 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: True.

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:20.120 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So we've gotten
through that part.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.700 align:middle line:84%
That pisses me off,
if I may say so.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:22.950 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: I understand.

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.600 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: But what about
some of the other tools

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.530 align:middle line:90%
you use, such as UV?

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:31.120 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: OK, a little quick
background for the folks

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.117 align:middle line:84%
if they aren't
familiar with it, there

00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:35.450 align:middle line:84%
was a therapy developed in
the early 20s in this country

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:38.390 align:middle line:84%
called ultraviolet light
blood irradiation developed

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:41.210 align:middle line:84%
by a doctor of science,
Emmet Kennard Knott,

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.590 align:middle line:90%
E.K. Knott of Seattle.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:45.990 align:middle line:84%
The device was used for the
better part of 30 to 40 years

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.490 align:middle line:90%
in this country.

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:48.970 align:middle line:84%
They were 40 papers published
in the conventional medical

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:54.880 align:middle line:84%
literature that document its
use over a 30, 40 year period,

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.810 align:middle line:84%
covering everything that we
pretty much see in medicine,

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:00.492 align:middle line:84%
I mean, bacterial,
viral infections.

00:43:00.492 --> 00:43:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And many people
will say, well, how

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:04.310 align:middle line:84%
do you know this would
affect Ebola or any virus

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:05.480 align:middle line:90%
for that matter?

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, the illnesses
that we see now

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:11.170 align:middle line:84%
are the same ones they
treated 40, 50, 70 years ago.

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:11.700 align:middle line:90%
They were--

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:12.741 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Except for Ebola.

00:43:12.741 --> 00:43:14.850 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: Except for Ebola.

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:18.240 align:middle line:84%
One of the few things that--
polio has always been a very

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.460 align:middle line:90%
terrifying thing for people.

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:22.680 align:middle line:84%
I think we went to an
era in America that

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:26.060 align:middle line:84%
was very, very frightening
for people, for families.

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:28.742 align:middle line:84%
But, as example, in
1938 in Los Angeles,

00:43:28.742 --> 00:43:30.950 align:middle line:84%
at one of the facilities,
one of the hospitals there,

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:33.010 align:middle line:84%
they had the ultraviolet
light devices.

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:36.050 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Knott--
K-N-O-T-T-- Hemo-Irradiator,

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:37.430 align:middle line:90%
the ultraviolet device.

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the a
few times in medicine--

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:42.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll use the C word, "cure."

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.779 align:middle line:84%
As a physician, you cannot
use the cure word in America.

00:43:44.779 --> 00:43:45.320 align:middle line:90%
You can cure.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.270 align:middle line:84%
You can't say you
can cure anything--

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:50.177 align:middle line:84%
that they were curing
polio in LA in '38,

00:43:50.177 --> 00:43:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's documented in the
archives of physical therapy.

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:55.630 align:middle line:90%


00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:57.910 align:middle line:84%
During that era of
this device, they

00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:59.760 align:middle line:84%
were treating what
we would consider

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.610 align:middle line:84%
all the known viral infections--
polio, encephalitis,

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:06.487 align:middle line:84%
viral pneumonia, viral
Hepatitis A, B, and C.

00:44:06.487 --> 00:44:07.820 align:middle line:90%
They didn't call it C back then.

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:11.741 align:middle line:84%
It was non-A, non-B, or they
just called it viral hepatitis.

00:44:11.741 --> 00:44:13.240 align:middle line:84%
But both, all the
viral conditions--

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.800 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And they were curing,
reversing the symptoms.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.810 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Reversing the
symptoms, giving people--

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:21.950 align:middle line:90%
returning them to normal.

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:24.740 align:middle line:84%
I'll throw in, I'll have
to call it anecdotal,

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:29.120 align:middle line:84%
but it's repetitively anecdotal,
I've done this on myself

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.860 align:middle line:90%
with the basic flu.

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I qualify the flu, not
so much as a physician

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:36.210 align:middle line:84%
but as a-- we've
all had the flu.

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:38.210 align:middle line:84%
People say, well how do
you know it was the flu?

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:40.235 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, my hair hurt.

00:44:40.235 --> 00:44:41.860 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, we all
know that feeling.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:42.380 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: You know that feeling.

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.530 align:middle line:84%
The old docs called
it bone-breaking.

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:48.270 align:middle line:84%
That's what the herb Eupatorium
or the homeopathic Eupatorium--

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:52.110 align:middle line:84%
bone-breaking pain
or bone-aching pain.

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:55.100 align:middle line:84%
But the ultraviolet
was clearing up

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:58.392 align:middle line:84%
all these different conditions,
and it's documented.

00:44:58.392 --> 00:44:59.350 align:middle line:90%
It's in the literature.

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:01.145 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've got copies
of all the papers.

00:45:01.145 --> 00:45:02.520 align:middle line:84%
I brought a booklet
with me today

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.010 align:middle line:90%
that has all the papers in it.

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:04.600 align:middle line:90%
So I'm just--

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.850 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And this is around
the same time Royal Raymond

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Rife was also--

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:12.030 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Yes, Dr. Rife's
a beautiful story.

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:16.330 align:middle line:84%
It's one of my first conspiracy
of medicine story, if you will.

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:21.250 align:middle line:84%
The man-- definitely the Nobel
Prize in science and medicine,

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:22.180 align:middle line:90%
for that matter.

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:25.660 align:middle line:84%
He refutes Pasteur
unequivocally and very clearly.

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, Pasteur, I've been told
that he recanted on his death

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:30.740 align:middle line:90%
bed, but it was too late.

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:33.150 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Well, and also for
anybody that's watching this,

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:36.860 align:middle line:84%
I've done a couple interviews
with Steven Ross, which

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:40.500 align:middle line:84%
is in either the CMN archives
or in the Gaiam library,

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.880 align:middle line:90%
regarding Rife, the whole story.

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.830 align:middle line:84%
So you can go there and
take a look at that.

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:48.720 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just
saying, in this era,

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.760 align:middle line:84%
this era was
pregnant with healing

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.810 align:middle line:84%
power and potentials
that have since

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:55.730 align:middle line:90%
been completely wiped out.

00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:56.850 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: That's very true.

00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:02.630 align:middle line:84%
I happen to know the folks
around the ultraviolet device,

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:05.892 align:middle line:84%
and when the inventor
passed away in '61,

00:46:05.892 --> 00:46:07.600 align:middle line:84%
the family just put
everything in storage

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:11.480 align:middle line:84%
because the harassment
by powers within

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:14.220 align:middle line:84%
the medical establishment
in America--

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:17.450 align:middle line:84%
there were about 150 doctors in
its heyday using the equipment,

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:21.540 align:middle line:84%
and it basically
would clear all-- well

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:26.040 align:middle line:84%
say, a bacterial infection
in hospital setting,

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.370 align:middle line:90%
we call it septicemia.

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:29.180 align:middle line:84%
It's where the blood
actually has bacteria

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.400 align:middle line:90%
growing within the blood.

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.500 align:middle line:84%
The slang term in
the hospital, they're

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.120 align:middle line:90%
growing bugs, as we call it.

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:38.250 align:middle line:84%
This day in time,
you're on IV antibiotics

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:41.510 align:middle line:84%
with septicemia, anywhere
from a minimum of a week

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:42.980 align:middle line:90%
to four to six weeks.

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:44.500 align:middle line:84%
In some cases,
they'll let you go

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:50.570 align:middle line:84%
if you're not so ill you can't
function in daily activities.

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:52.380 align:middle line:84%
You can do it at
home, if you will.

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:55.970 align:middle line:84%
But if it's like septicemia,
severe blood poisoning, if you

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:59.640 align:middle line:84%
will, from a bad infection,
you're in intensive care unit.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.460 align:middle line:90%
You're in ICU.

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:04.080 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: OK, so let's say
they're using UV technology.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.984 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: The standard--
I laugh and smile

00:47:05.984 --> 00:47:07.650 align:middle line:84%
when you say that
because we're looking,

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:11.590 align:middle line:84%
let's say, four to
six weeks minimum.

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:15.250 align:middle line:84%
The standard walk-out time of
the hospital with septicemia

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:18.600 align:middle line:84%
after one ultraviolet
treatment is 96 hours,

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.670 align:middle line:84%
assuming that the
wounds that you had that

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:23.349 align:middle line:84%
brought you in did not preclude
you from leaving the hospital.

00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:24.765 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
you could walk out

00:47:24.765 --> 00:47:27.660 align:middle line:90%
on your own power, 96 hours.

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:30.740 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: How does it work?

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what are the protocols?

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.150 align:middle line:90%
So what would a session be like?

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:37.520 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: A simple session,
from the literature,

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:41.430 align:middle line:84%
you take out 1.5 CCs of blood
per pound of body weight.

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:44.040 align:middle line:84%
It's exposed through the--
I'm fortunate to have

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.005 align:middle line:90%
an original Knott machine.

00:47:46.005 --> 00:47:49.260 align:middle line:84%
I acquired it from a retired
surgeon, who's now deceased,

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Breen Bland in
Memphis, Tennessee.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:52.880 align:middle line:90%
He used it for 30 years.

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.545 align:middle line:90%
And why does it still work?

00:47:54.545 --> 00:47:56.170 align:middle line:84%
They were built to
last for many years,

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:58.995 align:middle line:84%
but I have an engineer
friend who revamped it,

00:47:58.995 --> 00:47:59.870 align:middle line:90%
and it works as well.

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:02.250 align:middle line:84%
It meets all the
standard technical specs.

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:06.650 align:middle line:84%
But you take out 1.5 CCs of
blood per pound of body weight,

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:10.920 align:middle line:84%
up to 300, and you run
it through the machine

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:13.242 align:middle line:84%
and return it back
to the patient.

00:48:13.242 --> 00:48:13.950 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Takes about 20 to
30 minutes average.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:19.475 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So you take the blood
that has been irradiated--

00:48:19.475 --> 00:48:21.610 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: --exposed.

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:22.922 align:middle line:90%
Irradiated is the proper term.

00:48:22.922 --> 00:48:24.380 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, but
not in a bad way.

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:25.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not killing anything.

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:26.920 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Not ionizing
radiation from--

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:29.620 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Right, exactly,
so it's killing the bugs,

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and you put that
back in to then blend

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:33.900 align:middle line:84%
with the rest of your
blood circulating.

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:35.910 align:middle line:90%
How does it do that?

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:37.910 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: That's the big question.

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:39.410 align:middle line:84%
The years I've used
the device, I've

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:41.070 align:middle line:84%
been trying to find
ways to elucidate

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:42.070 align:middle line:90%
exactly what it's doing.

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:43.278 align:middle line:90%
There's a number of theories.

00:48:43.278 --> 00:48:45.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one theory is that
since it's ultraviolet light,

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:48.905 align:middle line:84%
you're enhancing, internally,
the vitamin D aspect.

00:48:48.905 --> 00:48:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, they've come
to learn the vitamin

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:55.870 align:middle line:84%
D plays a big role in microbial
destruction, if you will.

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:57.190 align:middle line:90%
So that's one aspect.

00:48:57.190 --> 00:49:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, it's not
exactly known what it's doing.

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:01.980 align:middle line:84%
What I can tell
you is that we do

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:04.665 align:middle line:84%
know that it enhances the
red blood cells' ability

00:49:04.665 --> 00:49:07.050 align:middle line:90%
to carry oxygen by up to 300%.

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Miley did some studies
back when, if you will.

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And, as well, we don't know
what it's doing immunologically,

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:17.770 align:middle line:84%
but we know there is a
massive immune response

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:20.020 align:middle line:84%
in a positive way,
meaning that let's say

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:22.910 align:middle line:84%
someone has the superior
blood poisoning, septicemia,

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:24.770 align:middle line:84%
and in old days they
called it moribund.

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Moribund is imminent death
within about 24 hours.

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:29.880 align:middle line:84%
You could do one
treatment on this person,

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:32.802 align:middle line:84%
and over the next 24 hours
watch their white blood cell

00:49:32.802 --> 00:49:35.260 align:middle line:84%
count, which is going to be
very high with blood poisoning,

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.260 align:middle line:84%
or septicemia, and their
fever kind of come down

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:41.060 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously to normal levels.

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:44.620 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So it's almost like
the blood that's been purified

00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:49.060 align:middle line:84%
is adding new information
in to the system,

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and the information exchange
is creating the reaction

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:53.760 align:middle line:90%
in the rest of the blood.

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:57.700 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Yes, basically,
the first thought,

00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:02.862 align:middle line:84%
most, I'll just say,
scientists or physicians

00:50:02.862 --> 00:50:05.320 align:middle line:84%
I've crossed go, well, how
could that small amount of blood

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.517 align:middle line:90%
affect the rest of the body?

00:50:06.517 --> 00:50:07.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, I really don't know.

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.203 align:middle line:90%
Nobody really does know.

00:50:08.203 --> 00:50:09.744 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: It's kind
of like homeopathy.

00:50:09.744 --> 00:50:14.970 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Yes, yes, that's
a great little story, too.

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:17.700 align:middle line:84%
That basically, when you put
this blood back in, now the one

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.480 align:middle line:84%
aspect that has been only
discussed during our era,

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.270 align:middle line:84%
a little bit back, during
Dr. Emmett Knott's era,

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:25.960 align:middle line:84%
is that we're somehow,
if you will accept

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.720 align:middle line:84%
the term, "photonically"--
passing light energy

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.870 align:middle line:84%
that we probably don't
fully understand or know

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:37.140 align:middle line:84%
the full ramifications and
works of into the other cells,

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and something very
profound does happen.

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.590 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And in light
is information?

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:46.100 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Yes, and as a little
bit aside anecdotally,

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:52.130 align:middle line:84%
I've used this device
since 1997, I guess,

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:58.530 align:middle line:84%
'97, '98 somewhere, and I've
treated many, many things.

00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:01.320 align:middle line:84%
I could just go
down the list, and I

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.669 align:middle line:84%
mean osteomyelitis, bone
infection, gangrene.

00:51:04.669 --> 00:51:06.294 align:middle line:84%
It just stops everything
in its tracks.

00:51:06.294 --> 00:51:08.294 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Well, it makes
me wonder about something

00:51:08.294 --> 00:51:09.186 align:middle line:90%
like Lyme disease.

00:51:09.186 --> 00:51:11.060 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Lyme's a little
bit different-- horse

00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:12.990 align:middle line:84%
of a different
color, if you will.

00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Lyme's being a spirochete,
very much akin to syphilis.

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:20.270 align:middle line:84%
If it's OK to interject
a little story here--

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:21.020 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Please do.

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:22.712 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: There's a
case, I want to say--

00:51:22.712 --> 00:51:23.670 align:middle line:90%
I hope this is correct.

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:26.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a Dr. Garcia in
Mexico that developed IPT,

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.330 align:middle line:90%
Insulin Potentiation Therapy.

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And basically that's
where you take insulin,

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.070 align:middle line:84%
you drop someone's
blood sugar very low,

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and anything you
interject into the system

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:39.610 align:middle line:84%
intravenously is immediately
taken into the cell.

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:44.940 align:middle line:84%
What makes this so profound, in
my opinion, is that he cleared,

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:49.950 align:middle line:84%
in the '20s and '30s, he
cleared or cured 400 cases

00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:52.360 align:middle line:90%
of third-stage syphilis.

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, for people, and this
not an insult, by any means.

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.380 align:middle line:84%
People that don't have
a medical background,

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:01.030 align:middle line:84%
to this day in time, you can
go to any of the top medical

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:03.966 align:middle line:84%
centers in the United States or
the world and ask them, well,

00:52:03.966 --> 00:52:05.890 align:middle line:84%
how will you get rid of
third-stage syphilis,

00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:08.640 align:middle line:84%
and the person's going to say,
we can't-- maybe even second

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.650 align:middle line:90%
stage, they can't.

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Only in the first
stage is when it

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.140 align:middle line:90%
can be treated by antibiotics.

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I'm putting
this out information-wise

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:22.300 align:middle line:84%
is that the spirochete
of Lyme's and syphilis

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:23.590 align:middle line:90%
are pretty much identical.

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying they're the same
one, but being spirochetes,

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:28.000 align:middle line:90%
they function the same way.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way Dr. Garcia
cleared the Lyme's was

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.460 align:middle line:90%
by using arsenical compounds.

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:34.517 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Oh, arsenic.

00:52:34.517 --> 00:52:36.600 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Arsenic-like
compounds-- well, many people

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:38.010 align:middle line:90%
get freaked out or scared.

00:52:38.010 --> 00:52:39.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's arsenic.

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, in very,
very minute doses,

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:45.280 align:middle line:84%
that's where the IPT,
Insulin Potentiation Therapy,

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:49.740 align:middle line:84%
was so profound is that you use
micro doses of things-- very

00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:53.650 align:middle line:90%
low doses, and it worked.

00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just say this, that
I have seen with my eyes

00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:01.720 align:middle line:84%
a number of cases using
a formulation that

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.880 align:middle line:90%
has an arsenical compound.

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:07.050 align:middle line:84%
That arsenical compound was
used in America for many years.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:09.080 align:middle line:84%
It's been recently
pulled by the FDA,

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:12.681 align:middle line:84%
and it cleared these
cases consecutively.

00:53:12.681 --> 00:53:14.180 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Of syphilis
or Lyme disease?

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:17.520 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: I'm sorry, Lyme's,
and it was verified.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:21.075 align:middle line:84%
Originally, there was a
dark field microscopy.

00:53:21.075 --> 00:53:22.710 align:middle line:84%
It was available
a number of years

00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:25.630 align:middle line:84%
ago-- Bowen Research Company and
then Central Florida Research.

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:27.440 align:middle line:84%
They've gone out
of business now.

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.360 align:middle line:84%
But I like their
testing the best.

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:33.970 align:middle line:84%
But documented-- these
organisms were gone-- killed.

00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was my logic
in doing it that way

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:38.700 align:middle line:84%
was because when I
learned about Dr. Garcia's

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:40.920 align:middle line:84%
work and the arsenicals,
it made sense

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.942 align:middle line:84%
that maybe this spirochetes
were sensitive to arsenic,

00:53:43.942 --> 00:53:45.400 align:middle line:84%
very much like the
guinea pigs were

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:50.350 align:middle line:84%
very sensitive to the dioxin
in testing Agent Orange back

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:52.670 align:middle line:90%
in the '60s.

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:57.160 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So now, kind
of coming back around,

00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.420 align:middle line:84%
so the UV, we've
talked about that.

00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:00.920 align:middle line:84%
That's what I
wanted to find out.

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:04.810 align:middle line:84%
How many people are still
practicing this in the US

00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:05.910 align:middle line:90%
or in the world?

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:07.247 align:middle line:90%
It seems so efficient.

00:54:07.247 --> 00:54:07.830 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: It is.

00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:14.500 align:middle line:84%
That's the problem is that
in 1961, the company that

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:17.010 align:middle line:84%
made this equipment
was closed and stopped

00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:18.890 align:middle line:84%
because the inventor
passed away.

00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:21.085 align:middle line:84%
And the family and
nobody wanted to deal

00:54:21.085 --> 00:54:23.960 align:middle line:84%
with the hassle of trying to
keep it in the medical system.

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:28.000 align:middle line:84%
The FDA didn't try to stop
them back in those days,

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and there's some technical
parameters on the original

00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:32.340 align:middle line:84%
device that make
it a little bit,

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.940 align:middle line:84%
from an engineering
viewpoint, to build it--

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.700 align:middle line:84%
it could be a little bit costly,
but it's still, in my opinion,

00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:41.250 align:middle line:84%
having been in hospital medicine
for many years, it would--

00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:45.100 align:middle line:84%
MRSAs-- the MRSA infection,
the Methicillin-Resistant

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Staphylococcus Aureus,
the term MRSA stands for--

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:49.537 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Oh, god, yes--
wipe it right out?

00:54:49.537 --> 00:54:50.870 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: It'll wipe it right out.

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I won't say how many
treatments, but I've treated--

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:54.740 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: How many hundreds
of thousands of people

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:56.720 align:middle line:84%
are infected from
hospital care alone?

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.100 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: Many.

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:01.390 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: OK, so back
to the question--

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:03.790 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: The only devices that
are out on the market now,

00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and I'll just be
blunt and direct--

00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:08.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to say it
from a technical viewpoint.

00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:10.760 align:middle line:84%
The technical aspects
of these devices

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.664 align:middle line:84%
that are out there on the market
won't do much of anything.

00:55:13.664 --> 00:55:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make some
people angry, probably,

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:17.310 align:middle line:84%
that build these
devices and use them.

00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:18.450 align:middle line:90%
But I've used them.

00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:21.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why it took me six years
to find the original Knott

00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:21.640 align:middle line:90%
machine.

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:24.172 align:middle line:90%
I had to track Dr. Bland down.

00:55:24.172 --> 00:55:26.630 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And you've seen the
difference between the devices?

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:28.330 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Major--
if you read-- I've

00:55:28.330 --> 00:55:30.460 align:middle line:84%
told a number of
physicians, you go

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:31.970 align:middle line:90%
read the literature like I did.

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:34.030 align:middle line:84%
You read all the
papers on ultraviolet.

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:35.900 align:middle line:84%
You read how the
machine was built,

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:41.180 align:middle line:84%
and you can go to Otto Glasser's
"Medical Physics," 1951,

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and you can read
how this device--

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:45.140 align:middle line:84%
it's the way
medical devices were

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:47.546 align:middle line:84%
brought into the public
arena, or I'm sorry,

00:55:47.546 --> 00:55:49.017 align:middle line:90%
the scientific arena.

00:55:49.017 --> 00:55:51.600 align:middle line:84%
That's how they were presented
to the scientific community was

00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.930 align:middle line:84%
through Otto Glasser's
book "Medical Physics,"

00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and it's the technical
description of the machine.

00:55:56.250 --> 00:55:58.060 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So it can
be built again?

00:55:58.060 --> 00:55:59.769 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: It could
be, yes, oh, yes.

00:55:59.769 --> 00:56:01.310 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So there's
a task for someone

00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:04.920 align:middle line:84%
who is ingenious in
this particular area

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:08.140 align:middle line:84%
to take this task
to hand and try

00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:09.740 align:middle line:84%
to build the proper
machine the way

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:11.920 align:middle line:84%
it was originally built
to the original specs.

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:15.156 align:middle line:84%
I mean, wow, there's an
opportunity for someone.

00:56:15.156 --> 00:56:17.280 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: The interesting
aspect is that all it takes

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:18.290 align:middle line:90%
is some money.

00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And this day in time,
even the amount of money

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:24.080 align:middle line:84%
to build the prototypes,
and I say prototype--

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:29.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean some rough,
shorn piece of junk

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:30.620 align:middle line:90%
sitting on the table.

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:31.870 align:middle line:90%
When I say prototype--

00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:33.015 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: You mean a
functioning model.

00:56:33.015 --> 00:56:33.970 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: --totally functioning.

00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:35.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean a clinical model.

00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:36.010 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: What does it take?

00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:37.676 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what it
takes to build that?

00:56:37.676 --> 00:56:40.997 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: We've calculated
it, and it's about $400,000.

00:56:40.997 --> 00:56:42.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's only-- it's because--

00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:44.750 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And that's a prototype,
so if someone were to do this--

00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:45.090 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Well, that's
the original machine.

00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:48.510 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, and then to
put them into production,

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:50.190 align:middle line:90%
what could one be built for?

00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:52.065 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: I would say you
probably could easily

00:56:52.065 --> 00:56:56.000 align:middle line:84%
build one for $15,000, $10,000
to $15,000, maybe even less.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.990 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: See now, boo,
that's another thing.

00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:59.020 align:middle line:90%
That just--

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:03.830 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Well there's
a couple small aspects

00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:06.300 align:middle line:84%
engineering-wise or
mechanically that

00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:08.899 align:middle line:84%
need to be dealt with
that make it costly.

00:57:08.899 --> 00:57:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Like the old original lamp--
and this is what, in my opinion,

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:14.220 align:middle line:84%
made the lamp or the device
so valuable with respect

00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:17.310 align:middle line:84%
to what it could do, is that
the lamp was a full spectrum.

00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:19.460 align:middle line:84%
It covered the entire
spectrum of ultraviolet.

00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:22.970 align:middle line:84%
The devices on the market
right now are more or less

00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:26.901 align:middle line:84%
single frequency-- the A, B, and
C frequencies of ultraviolet.

00:57:26.901 --> 00:57:27.400 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.733 align:middle line:90%
They're just single frequencies.

00:57:28.733 --> 00:57:31.230 align:middle line:84%
This covered the full gamut
along with the harmonics

00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:34.824 align:middle line:84%
from about 160 nanometer
wavelength to 380 or 400.

00:57:34.824 --> 00:57:35.740 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Full spectrum.

00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:37.490 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: Full spectrum, yes.

00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:41.830 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: With the technical savvy
that exists in the world today,

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:44.520 align:middle line:84%
there is no reason that
these can't be built.

00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:48.180 align:middle line:84%
But then if they did, what's
the FDAs position on them right

00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:48.900 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:51.540 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Well, the
FDA would want you

00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:56.150 align:middle line:84%
to go through clinical trial,
which I find ridiculous.

00:57:56.150 --> 00:58:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I have a letter from
the FDA dated 1999,

00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:05.150 align:middle line:84%
I think, stating that the
Knott device has premium

00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:06.960 align:middle line:90%
status or grandfather status.

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:09.210 align:middle line:84%
But they made the comment
that they would not

00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:10.929 align:middle line:84%
want to see it come
out into production

00:58:10.929 --> 00:58:12.970 align:middle line:84%
because the amount of
mercury that's in the lamp.

00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:14.640 align:middle line:90%
But that could be altered.

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Because of our technology these
days, we could change that.

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:21.920 align:middle line:84%
That, I'm hoping,
is their only reason

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:25.500 align:middle line:84%
for not wanting to
see the device in use.

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I contend the device
would do wonders

00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:31.374 align:middle line:90%
for our medical community.

00:58:31.374 --> 00:58:33.040 align:middle line:84%
There's one therapy
I do want to mention

00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:33.610 align:middle line:90%
before we get too far along.

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:34.568 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes, please do.

00:58:34.568 --> 00:58:35.770 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: It's ozone therapy.

00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:36.960 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Oh, yes,
ozone-- because we only

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.460 align:middle line:84%
have a few minutes
left, and we want

00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:40.150 align:middle line:84%
to get to the everyday
things, please, I

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:42.340 align:middle line:84%
almost forgot to ask
you about ozone, please.

00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:45.370 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: The reason
I mention ozone

00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:49.590 align:middle line:84%
is that in 1991 the FDA
approved the use of ozone

00:58:49.590 --> 00:58:54.230 align:middle line:84%
for the maybe slang term "flash
sterilization" of hospital

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:55.747 align:middle line:84%
instruments in the
operating room.

00:58:55.747 --> 00:58:58.205 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to qualify that
for folks that don't understand

00:58:58.205 --> 00:59:03.409 align:middle line:84%
what I'm saying is that when
you're doing surgery, you know,

00:59:03.409 --> 00:59:04.200 align:middle line:90%
we're human beings.

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.440 align:middle line:90%
We drop things.

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, when an instrument
hits the floor,

00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:10.770 align:middle line:84%
the three-second
rule does not apply.

00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:12.550 align:middle line:84%
That instrument has
to be resterilized.

00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:15.170 align:middle line:84%
You can't just jerk it off the
floor and reuse it, of course.

00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the, quote
unquote, "old days,"

00:59:17.050 --> 00:59:19.930 align:middle line:84%
it was steam flash
sterilization,

00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:21.900 align:middle line:84%
and that still took
almost 30 minutes.

00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:24.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we'd throw them in the
sterilizer and get them out,

00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.041 align:middle line:84%
and you just grab
them out with tongs

00:59:26.041 --> 00:59:29.510 align:middle line:84%
and throw them into a cold
basin of either sterile water

00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:31.600 align:middle line:84%
or sterile saline
to cool it down.

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:33.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's an
instrument the surgeon

00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:35.330 align:middle line:90%
was using when he dropped it.

00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:39.640 align:middle line:84%
So 15, 20, 30 minutes is not
exactly like coffee break time.

00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:42.390 align:middle line:84%
So the ozone, to
give you an example,

00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:46.450 align:middle line:84%
it is the second most
powerfully oxidizing substance

00:59:46.450 --> 00:59:49.489 align:middle line:84%
on the planet next to
fluorine, or fluoride,

00:59:49.489 --> 00:59:51.530 align:middle line:84%
which you cannot obviously
use in the human body.

00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Ozone does not
damage human tissue.

00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could
make it do it, and it

00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:59.370 align:middle line:84%
will damage your red blood cell
in the wrong concentrations

00:59:59.370 --> 01:00:00.820 align:middle line:90%
otherwise.

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:04.790 align:middle line:84%
What I'm getting at is that with
respect to the sterilization

01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:07.060 align:middle line:84%
or the killing of
an organism, you

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:10.606 align:middle line:84%
could sterilize a surgical
instrument in 10 seconds maybe.

01:00:10.606 --> 01:00:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean whatever length
of time it takes you--

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.830 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So how do you
use it in the human body?

01:00:13.830 --> 01:00:15.413 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: In the human
body you take out

01:00:15.413 --> 01:00:17.534 align:middle line:84%
a volume of blood, the
classic German protocol,

01:00:17.534 --> 01:00:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and I'm certified by
the Medical Society

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.770 align:middle line:84%
for Ozone Therapy
out of Stuttgart.

01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:24.640 align:middle line:84%
You take 100 to
200 CCs of blood,

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:28.210 align:middle line:84%
infuse the ozone into the blood,
and then reinfuse the blood

01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:29.180 align:middle line:90%
back into the person.

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:30.530 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Kind of like UV.

01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:31.872 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: Kind of like the UV.

01:00:31.872 --> 01:00:34.080 align:middle line:84%
This is what I call a closed
system because you never

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.930 align:middle line:84%
break the complete
integrity of the system,

01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:39.410 align:middle line:84%
whereas the ultraviolet, you
have to take the blood away.

01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:42.760 align:middle line:84%
But this you take it out, treat
it, and put it right back.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:47.154 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that it kills
all organisms instantly

01:00:47.154 --> 01:00:48.820 align:middle line:84%
outside the human
body, people go, well,

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:49.490 align:middle line:84%
how do you know
it's going to do it

01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:51.170 align:middle line:90%
on the inside of the human body?

01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Ozone's been used for
over 100, 150 years.

01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:56.850 align:middle line:84%
In Germany, it's been used for
better part of 60 or 70 years

01:00:56.850 --> 01:00:59.630 align:middle line:84%
medically, and there's just
reams of documentation.

01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:02.310 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And it's been used
for highly toxic things,

01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:04.750 align:middle line:84%
like spider bites,
brown recluse, where

01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:08.690 align:middle line:84%
instead of losing all of
that flesh down to the bone,

01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:10.690 align:middle line:84%
you can actually stop
it in its tracks.

01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:11.606 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: Piece of cake.

01:01:11.606 --> 01:01:13.320 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: I know I've
read about that.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.690 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: I've been doing
that for a long time.

01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:20.341 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the first uses
of injecting ozone in the skin

01:01:20.341 --> 01:01:22.340 align:middle line:84%
that I used was with brown
recluse spider bites.

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:23.640 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: I know
someone who was bitten

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.973 align:middle line:84%
and who you worked on actually,
now, that I remember it.

01:01:25.973 --> 01:01:27.330 align:middle line:90%
It stopped it in its tracks.

01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:27.750 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: It does.

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:28.256 align:middle line:90%
It does.

01:01:28.256 --> 01:01:30.380 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: A little mark, but
it didn't eat the flesh.

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:31.950 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Considering
that I've known

01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:34.560 align:middle line:84%
of a case where a gentleman
in Phoenix, when I first moved

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.974 align:middle line:90%
to Arizona, had lost his leg.

01:01:35.974 --> 01:01:37.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't that there
have been any deaths.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.212 align:middle line:90%
I imagine it could have.

01:01:40.212 --> 01:01:41.920 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: It can be
really bad, and there's

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.970 align:middle line:84%
a rash of that going
around in Sedona right now.

01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:46.010 align:middle line:84%
For some reason,
the spiders are out.

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:48.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, one more question--
oh, yeah, go ahead.

01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:50.115 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: I think it's what you're
going to say, but go ahead

01:01:50.115 --> 01:01:50.340 align:middle line:90%
and please ask it.

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:53.210 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Well, what I wanted to
say is we're about out of time,

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and so for people just wanting
to bump their immune systems

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:59.620 align:middle line:84%
as best they can at home,
this is your specialty.

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:01.630 align:middle line:84%
What are the ordinary
inexpensive things

01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:03.469 align:middle line:90%
we can do ourselves?

01:02:03.469 --> 01:02:05.510 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: To me, the biggest
things that we can do,

01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:09.825 align:middle line:84%
number one, is keeping our
adrenal glands supported.

01:02:09.825 --> 01:02:11.700 align:middle line:84%
We know the adrenals
are for fight or flight.

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.575 align:middle line:84%
They're also responsible
for the mobilization

01:02:13.575 --> 01:02:17.525 align:middle line:84%
of the immune system in
any illness-- any illness.

01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:18.650 align:middle line:90%
There are number of things.

01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:21.082 align:middle line:84%
I won't take our time to
try to go through everything

01:02:21.082 --> 01:02:22.540 align:middle line:84%
for supporting
adrenal, but there's

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:25.190 align:middle line:84%
glandular therapies,
botanical therapies,

01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:27.909 align:middle line:84%
like Siberian ginseng to
support adrenal function.

01:02:27.909 --> 01:02:29.950 align:middle line:84%
But you want to support
the adrenals, number one.

01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Then we get into the
botanicals, the classics immune

01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:35.510 align:middle line:84%
enhancement-- astragalus,
echinacea, goldenseal.

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Many of those things can be
used to enhance immune function.

01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:42.765 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin C orally, like we spoke
earlier, zinc, for example--

01:02:42.765 --> 01:02:44.640 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: That's one people
forget about often.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.030 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: Zinc is crucial.

01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:48.280 align:middle line:84%
I apologize; I don't remember
the mechanisms off hand,

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:51.980 align:middle line:84%
but it's utilized definitely
in immune function

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and keeping the
immune system strong.

01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:56.690 align:middle line:84%
The other therapy that
I wanted to mention

01:02:56.690 --> 01:03:00.550 align:middle line:84%
that naturopathic physicians
or naturopathic medicine

01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:03.210 align:middle line:84%
in the lineage comes from
Father Kneipp out of Germany

01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:06.300 align:middle line:84%
and the water cures
is hydrotherapy,

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and many people that would
hear, as a naturopath

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.870 align:middle line:84%
you talk about hydrotherapy
or water therapy,

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:12.100 align:middle line:90%
and they just laugh at us.

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to throw this
in; Dr. John Harvey Kellogg,

01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Kellogg's of Battle Creek.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Kellogg was an M.D.,
but he was an eclectic M.D.,

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and he had the single
largest healing

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:25.330 align:middle line:84%
sanitarium in the world,
and he used hydrotherapy

01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:27.020 align:middle line:90%
in Battle Creek, Michigan.

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote, I call it, the
treatise on hydrotherapy.

01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:34.877 align:middle line:84%
It's about 1,200 pages of how to
use water in all of its forms.

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:36.960 align:middle line:84%
But specifically the
hydrotherapy I'm referring to

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.920 align:middle line:84%
is where you heat the body up
as hot as you can tolerate.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.800 align:middle line:84%
You go jump into a cold plunge
or a cold shower for only 30

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.790 align:middle line:90%
seconds to a minute.

01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Come back to the hot
and cold, or the hot--

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.777 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: It's amazing the
way it makes you feel, too.

01:03:48.777 --> 01:03:49.360 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: It is.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, it has lots of
effects, but the one thing

01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:55.140 align:middle line:84%
I want to stress
here that's important

01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:58.172 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a
substance in our systems

01:03:58.172 --> 01:04:00.630 align:middle line:84%
that comes into play when we
become ill with a fever called

01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:02.180 align:middle line:90%
heat-shock protein.

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.439 align:middle line:84%
And heat-shock protein, not
a lot is known about it.

01:04:04.439 --> 01:04:05.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a gentleman
on the East coast

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:06.510 align:middle line:90%
who's one of the authorities.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:08.330 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken with
him several times

01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:11.983 align:middle line:84%
and bantered about with
these things is that there

01:04:11.983 --> 01:04:14.100 align:middle line:84%
are a number therapies
in the world--

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.450 align:middle line:84%
the hyperthermia for cancer
therapy out of Germany,

01:04:16.450 --> 01:04:17.895 align:middle line:90%
the Keller bed, I think.

01:04:17.895 --> 01:04:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And people are going,
well, how does it work?

01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:20.710 align:middle line:90%
What does it do?

01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:23.832 align:middle line:84%
And in collaboration
with the gentleman

01:04:23.832 --> 01:04:25.290 align:middle line:84%
on the East coast
at the university

01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:27.490 align:middle line:84%
there, is that the
heat-shock protein

01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:31.390 align:middle line:84%
is induced, like in the
classic hydrotherapy we do.

01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:32.370 align:middle line:90%
You heat the body up.

01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:34.470 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to
simulate a fever.

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:36.390 align:middle line:90%
It's like using a sauna.

01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:37.970 align:middle line:90%
We call it sauna.

01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:39.820 align:middle line:84%
My mentor was a
Finnish gentleman.

01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:41.750 align:middle line:90%
He said it's sah-oo-nah.

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:43.972 align:middle line:84%
But you want to
keep the body up,

01:04:43.972 --> 01:04:45.180 align:middle line:90%
and you're mimicking a fever.

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, that induces
heat-shock protein.

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Everybody says, well, why do
you keep saying "heat-shock

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.470 align:middle line:90%
protein?"

01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:51.670 align:middle line:10%
Well, it induces
the immune system.

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:53.370 align:middle line:10%
It brings the
entire immune system

01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:56.370 align:middle line:10%
into play in any illness,
be it a sore throat

01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:58.277 align:middle line:10%
or be it the flu or whatever.

01:04:58.277 --> 01:05:00.610 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Heat up in a hot bath,
take a quick cold shower,

01:05:00.610 --> 01:05:02.550 align:middle line:84%
heat in a hot bath,
quick cold shower.

01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:03.960 align:middle line:90%
Will a couple rounds do it?

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.126 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Two, I prefer three,
just because we go back

01:05:06.126 --> 01:05:09.380 align:middle line:84%
to three little pigs and three's
the magic number kind of thing.

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:11.384 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And that's
simple enough.

01:05:11.384 --> 01:05:13.550 align:middle line:84%
All these things you've
spoken about, we can all do.

01:05:13.550 --> 01:05:14.624 align:middle line:90%
It's all cost effective.

01:05:14.624 --> 01:05:15.790 align:middle line:90%
HUTTON: Very cost effective.

01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:17.248 align:middle line:84%
I mean, hydrotheraphy--
just water.

01:05:17.248 --> 01:05:19.370 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And then for
the exotic stuff,

01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:20.824 align:middle line:90%
well-- Doc, thank you so much.

01:05:20.824 --> 01:05:22.490 align:middle line:84%
HUTTON: Thank you for
having me, Regina.

01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:24.940 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: This has been
very, very elucidating

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:26.340 align:middle line:90%
to me and many others.

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.000 align:middle line:10%
And meanwhile, it
looks like we're

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.500 align:middle line:10%
going to have to
go to a little work

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.390 align:middle line:10%
to ferret out our
healing partners

01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:33.380 align:middle line:10%
with these technologies
as they appear

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:36.190 align:middle line:10%
to have one hand tied behind
their backs at the moment.

01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:38.000 align:middle line:84%
If you need to
connect with Doc, you

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.020 align:middle line:84%
can go to dochutton@gmail.com
for any kinds of questions

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.840 align:middle line:84%
or dialogue you might
be interested in.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

01:05:46.810 --> 01:06:05.090 align:middle line:90%
