00:00:27.906 --> 00:00:30.030 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Get
ready for a fascinating trip

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.930 align:middle line:10%
through America's occult
and spiritual history.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.730 align:middle line:84%
I think the best way
to set this story up

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.790 align:middle line:84%
is the following quote,
"Laws, it has been observed,

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.080 align:middle line:90%
are like sausages.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:84%
One should never
watch their creation.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:84%
The same could be
said of religions."

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.020 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.500 align:middle line:10%
With that, meet Mitch Horowitz,
author of "Occult America."

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:10%
Mitch, first of all,
I have to say what

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.420 align:middle line:10%
a pleasure it is to-- because
I do so much research.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.950 align:middle line:10%
I read book, after
book, after book.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And every now and then, you
see a book and say, yes,

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:90%
They really did their homework.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.830 align:middle line:90%
They did it right.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And you feel like a soul
brother because everything

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:84%
you've talked about in there,
not only is it well-researched

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:90%
and documented.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Your style of writing is
very live and beautiful.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle line:90%
And it just engaged me.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.170 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to be researching.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So I just have to compliment
you on the work you've done.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.244 align:middle line:84%
And I think that stands
out as an endorsement.

00:01:19.244 --> 00:01:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH HOROWITZ:
Well, thank you.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.460 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's great to be here.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.966 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's start with the
epigraph in the book, which

00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:27.014 align:middle line:90%
is very mysterious.

00:01:27.014 --> 00:01:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that,
and I thought, oh.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.720 align:middle line:90%
This guy knows.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:90%
He knows.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.460 align:middle line:90%
He's been studying.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And it is "O, Egypt,
Egypt, there will remain

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.410 align:middle line:90%
of thy religions only fables."

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And then it is credited
to the Hermetica.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.880 align:middle line:84%
You said you chose
that very carefully.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to
share with us why

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.569 align:middle line:84%
you chose that phrase and
the meaning behind it.

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I did choose
it very carefully.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, in the many,
many, dozens of interviews

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.930 align:middle line:84%
I've done, no one has ever once
asked me about that epigraph.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
carefully chosen.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.620 align:middle line:84%
It's from the
Hermetic manuscripts,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.430 align:middle line:84%
which were a collection of
manuscripts that were written

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:84%
down mostly in
Greek, occasionally

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.810 align:middle line:84%
in Latin, by Hellenic scribes
in the final generations

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.380 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Egypt in the
decades immediately following

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.000 align:middle line:90%
the death of Christ.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And what these scribes
were doing, primarily

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.920 align:middle line:84%
in the city of
Alexandria, is that they

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.460 align:middle line:84%
were trying to write down
the magical philosophies

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.890 align:middle line:84%
that animated ancient Egypt
for centuries upon centuries.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Very often, these
things were only

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.440 align:middle line:84%
conveyed through oral tradition,
through symbol, sometimes

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.610 align:middle line:90%
through hieroglyphs.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.930 align:middle line:84%
But the Egyptian culture wasn't
primarily a written culture.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.900 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't its tool of choice,
but writing was the tool

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.150 align:middle line:90%
of choice of the Greeks.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And so these ancient
Greek Egyptian scribes

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:84%
using the Greek
alphabet wrote down

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:84%
some of the magical,
and mystical,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and metaphysical
philosophies of ancient Egypt

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.710 align:middle line:84%
in the so-called
Hermetic manuscripts.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And they mourned the fact
that the civilization

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.020 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Egypt was
in its final decades.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And in the Hermetica, they
speak of the notion that Egypt--

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:84%
ancient, ancient Egypt--
also inherited that

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.929 align:middle line:90%
from a previous time.

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
continues going back,

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and they traced that back even
to Atlantis so, of course,

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:84%
it would have had to be
oral traditions and symbolic

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:90%
and nature.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.211 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And so what the Hermetic
manuscripts represent

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.810 align:middle line:84%
are a record or, at
least, a fragment

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle line:84%
of a record of
unthinkably old ideas.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is
something I've tried

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate in "Occult
America" is that those

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.210 align:middle line:84%
of us who are part of the
alternative spiritual culture

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:84%
today are part of
a family lineage.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.710 align:middle line:84%
However ancient, however
frayed and broken the thread

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.550 align:middle line:84%
has sometimes gotten,
there is, nonetheless,

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle line:84%
a legitimate family tree, a
thread of connection between us

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.270 align:middle line:90%
and the ancients.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And the thread, as
far as I can see--

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
go into this lineage,

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.800 align:middle line:84%
which is just
fascinating to me--

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.430 align:middle line:84%
is that we're trying
as human beings

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.680 align:middle line:84%
to come into some understanding
of the hidden occult--

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.370 align:middle line:84%
the word occult meaning
hidden, simply unseen nature

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.190 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.569 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
we're talking about all

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.730 align:middle line:84%
of the world of new thought,
of healing with mind,

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.680 align:middle line:84%
all these things we're
going to go into,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.960 align:middle line:84%
we're still trying
to contend with how

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.420 align:middle line:84%
does that all interface
consciousness,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.699 align:middle line:84%
and the human mind, and
the body, and so forth?

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's just the hidden
nature of reality, right?

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Exactly.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And occult, as you alluded,
simply means hidden, or unseen,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.000 align:middle line:84%
coming from the Latin
word occultus or occulto.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.310 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
sinister about it.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And really a working
definition of the occult

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:84%
is simply the belief in
a world of unseen forces

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.450 align:middle line:84%
whose influence can be
felt on us and through us.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.510 align:middle line:84%
That is the occult, nothing
to be afraid of and so much

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.620 align:middle line:90%
to experiment with.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.828 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, and
it's so good you said this.

00:04:59.828 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:84%
We're going to extend that
conversation a little bit later

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.230 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:84%
But because of what has
happened, this kind of fracture

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.770 align:middle line:84%
in new thought that ultimately
went over into conspiracy

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.860 align:middle line:84%
theory and beginning to
mistrust the various forces,

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get into
the genesis of mistrust

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and one of the lineages
a little later.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.060 align:middle line:84%
But what's happened is
that all of these words

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.300 align:middle line:84%
have essentially been demonized
within this community.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Many people are really quite
frightened and turned off

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.159 align:middle line:84%
if you say occult,
hidden, Illuminati.

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.890 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:31.931 align:middle line:90%
That's a wonderful point.

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And one of my commitments
actually-- and I

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.060 align:middle line:84%
try to practice this
in my work and practice

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.750 align:middle line:84%
it day-to-day-- is I do not
run away from this language.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.590 align:middle line:84%
It has historical
integrity, which

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
is why I use terms like
occult, ESP, New Age.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Many people use the term
New Age as an epithet.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.110 align:middle line:90%
I do not.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:84%
To me, it means
therapeutic spirituality.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.860 align:middle line:90%
I apply it to myself.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And I have been
able to communicate

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.222 align:middle line:84%
within the mainstream
media world

00:05:59.222 --> 00:06:01.430 align:middle line:84%
at places like the New York
Times and the Wall Street

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.830 align:middle line:90%
Journal--

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: NPR.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --and NPR as well
as more alternative places

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:84%
using these terms because they
have historical integrity.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And when I get pushback,
sort of as you were alluding,

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.090 align:middle line:84%
I very often get that
pushback from places

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.850 align:middle line:84%
within our own alternative
spiritual culture who

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.300 align:middle line:84%
are so fearful of the
associations with these words.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.110 align:middle line:90%
But, look.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.152 align:middle line:84%
You know, critics are going
to use these words anyway,

00:06:24.152 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and that's never a reason
to run away from something.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.776 align:middle line:84%
And my feeling is
that if somebody

00:06:27.776 --> 00:06:30.320 align:middle line:84%
is going to call me New
Age or make reference

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.230 align:middle line:84%
to the occult, or the
paranormal, or ESP,

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm not ashamed of
any of those words.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think we should
lose that historical lineage.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree with
you, and also this

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:84%
is where maturation and
discernment comes into play.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.700 align:middle line:84%
We can't, just like
children, believe everything

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.110 align:middle line:90%
we're fed on the Internet.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.489 align:middle line:90%
And I won't say anymore on that.

00:06:51.489 --> 00:06:52.572 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about--yeah.

00:06:52.572 --> 00:06:53.988 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: A lot
to unpack there.

00:06:53.988 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There is.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So your personal journey
started nine years old.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.270 align:middle line:90%
You're with your family.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.690 align:middle line:90%
You're at a drugstore.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.090 align:middle line:84%
You drop a coin in
a little machine.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.340 align:middle line:90%
Tell us the rest of the story.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.030 align:middle line:90%
It was so cute.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.040 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in the
borough of Queens

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.770 align:middle line:90%
in New York City in the 1970s.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.092 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually great time
to be interested in the occult

00:07:12.092 --> 00:07:14.300 align:middle line:84%
because, you know, I'd run
home from school and watch

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.720 align:middle line:84%
reruns of Dark Shadows and The
Twilight Zone on television.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And there would be Merv
Griffin interviewing

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.990 align:middle line:84%
astrologers, and the Maharishi,
and robed gurus, and so forth.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.140 align:middle line:84%
My sister was reading the
books of Carlos Castaneda.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.120 align:middle line:84%
The Arrow Book Club
at school was always

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.450 align:middle line:84%
selling us books on Big
Foot and flying saucers.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was fascinated
with all these things.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I was always taking up books
of folklore and superstition

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.950 align:middle line:90%
from the public library.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.640 align:middle line:84%
One day I brought home a book
of Pennsylvania Dutch folklore

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:84%
from the public library, and it
had this pentagram-like chart

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.550 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And it instructed you to close
your eyes, and lower a pin,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.819 align:middle line:84%
and get some sort of
personal prophecy.

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:54.110 align:middle line:90%
So I followed the instructions.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.920 align:middle line:84%
I lowered a pin, and I got
the prophecy, a letter.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Now I was nine years old, so
many letters didn't reach me

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:90%
in Bellerose, Queens.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.770 align:middle line:90%
The next day, a letter arrived.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.185 align:middle line:90%
It was from the library.

00:08:05.185 --> 00:08:07.274 align:middle line:84%
And it was an
overdue book notice.

00:08:07.274 --> 00:08:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love the
way you wrote that.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.430 align:middle line:90%
You said, OK.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:11.860 align:middle line:90%
It was an overdue book notice.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.758 align:middle line:84%
But your next sentence
was but still.

00:08:14.758 --> 00:08:15.716 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: But still--

00:08:15.716 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.012 align:middle line:90%
--it was unexpected.

00:08:18.012 --> 00:08:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you were hooked?

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: I was hooked.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I was interested in newspaper
astrology and all these things.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was asking myself I know
that however sensationalized

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.560 align:middle line:84%
things get, or however
they're sort of repackaged

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.370 align:middle line:84%
into these little,
bit-sized consumer morsels,

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.140 align:middle line:90%
there's still philosophy there.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.539 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is, even
in newspaper astrology,

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:40.159 align:middle line:84%
even the little
star scrolls that I

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.289 align:middle line:84%
could buy for a
dime at a drugstore

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.120 align:middle line:90%
when I was a kid, look.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.690 align:middle line:84%
There are ideas
there that go back

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.660 align:middle line:84%
to ancient Egypt,
ancient Babylon,

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.650 align:middle line:90%
the Hellenic civilizations.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.630 align:middle line:90%
They've gotten broken.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.756 align:middle line:90%
They've gotten interrupted.

00:08:54.756 --> 00:08:55.880 align:middle line:90%
But there's a thread there.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And it became my life's
mission to follow that thread.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you continued
that through your teenage years,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:90%
all of these studies and--

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I was
very blessed to.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This has been your
entire life's journey so far?

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Listen.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.950 align:middle line:84%
The thing I would
wish for everyone

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.860 align:middle line:84%
is that they get to
follow their childhood

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:90%
passions into adulthood.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's been a great,
great blessing for me.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to leave
these things behind.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.620 align:middle line:84%
I've continued to study them
as a historian and as a seeker

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.245 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah OK.

00:09:22.245 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:84%
We're going to launch onto
this journey, this path.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:25.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, boy.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as you can see, I have
probably at least 100 pages

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle line:84%
of your book dog-eared
and underlined in-between

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.840 align:middle line:84%
because it's so
rich with detail.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I can't quite imagine
how many years

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.500 align:middle line:84%
it took to gather
this information,

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.930 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to start at
the beginning of the book

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.290 align:middle line:84%
where you're talking
about, in 1693, there

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:49.880 align:middle line:84%
was a father philosopher named
Johannes Kelpius in Germany,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.700 align:middle line:90%
the Rhineland.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about all
the stuff he was into,

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:84%
and his merry followers
because this is the beginning.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It is.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And it really figures
into the story of America.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.740 align:middle line:84%
There was a great flowering
of interest in occult

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.540 align:middle line:90%
thought during the Renaissance.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.310 align:middle line:84%
That's where the term
occult came from.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Philosophers were
trying to find a way--

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Illuminati
came from there.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.223 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: You know,
they were trying

00:10:12.223 --> 00:10:14.930 align:middle line:84%
to find terms to talk about
this ancient spirituality.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
backlash against it.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And part of that
backlash was what

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.440 align:middle line:84%
was called the 30
Years War, which

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.460 align:middle line:84%
was a horrible conflict that
tore apart this German speaking

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.950 align:middle line:90%
region of central Europe.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And for generations after the
30 Years War ended in 1648,

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:37.120 align:middle line:84%
the area between the
Rhine valley and Bohemia

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.170 align:middle line:90%
was just decimated.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So people who had been involved
in different mystical and

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.760 align:middle line:84%
occult movements there often
felt the need to get out.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And word spread
across the Atlantic

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.340 align:middle line:84%
that the new world,
the American colonies,

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.530 align:middle line:84%
were a kind of safe
haven for people

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.020 align:middle line:90%
with radical religious ideas.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And this young man
named Johannes Kelpius

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:84%
who was a mystical monk
who practiced numerology,

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and astrology, and the
magical uses of song--

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, also like
mystical Christianity,

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.025 align:middle line:90%
like Meister Eckhart.

00:11:10.025 --> 00:11:10.332 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.332 --> 00:11:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Devout Christian.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.520 align:middle line:84%
He was on the radical edge of
the Lutheran church, actually.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.410 align:middle line:84%
He led a small band of
followers out of central Europe

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:25.390 align:middle line:84%
into London on a ship across
the Atlantic to, of all places,

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.240 align:middle line:84%
the city of Philadelphia,
the City of Brotherly

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Love, so founded by
William Penn, a Quaker who

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.900 align:middle line:84%
had experienced
discrimination at Oxford.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And his dream was
to establish a city

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:84%
where people of different
religious backgrounds

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.440 align:middle line:90%
could get along.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And this was a dream, as it
happened, that came true.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And when Kelpius and
his band of followers

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:51.070 align:middle line:84%
showed up in Philly
in June of 1694,

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.250 align:middle line:84%
there was a town of
probably about 500 houses.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.890 align:middle line:84%
But there was a degree of
religious tolerance there.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And they found a little commune
on the banks of the Wissahickon

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.320 align:middle line:90%
Creek.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.330 align:middle line:90%
People knew about it.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.470 align:middle line:90%
They visited it.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.120 align:middle line:90%
Word spread back to Europe.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And more religious
radicals made the journey

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.080 align:middle line:90%
across the Atlantic.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.560 align:middle line:84%
So we think of American
religious liberty

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.090 align:middle line:84%
as beginning with
the Constitution.

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:84%
It began generations
before the Constitution.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:84%
The American colonies,
rightly, had a reputation

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.995 align:middle line:84%
as a safe harbor for people
with radical religious ideas.

00:12:24.995 --> 00:12:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And was this what was called
the tabernacle in the forest?

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:29.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that term.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: That was
one of the terms that

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.730 align:middle line:90%
was applied to these people.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And there were other followers
of Kelpius who came to America.

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.520 align:middle line:84%
They found that,
after a certain time,

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:84%
he had died, probably
of tuberculosis.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.232 align:middle line:84%
But they went on to
form their own colonies.

00:12:44.232 --> 00:12:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And eventually a group
called the Shaking

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Quakers, or the Shakers, came
over from Manchester, England.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.240 align:middle line:84%
They founded a colony
in Albany, New York.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.070 align:middle line:84%
They began to fan out
across the country.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.220 align:middle line:84%
These little mystical colonies
were a very vital part

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.360 align:middle line:90%
of American life.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.270 align:middle line:84%
People would visit them, write
about them, and they grew.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I sure wish that his
brand of Lutheranism

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.530 align:middle line:84%
had carried on
because I was raised--

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.150 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you what squashed me--

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.960 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in the Missouri
Synod version of the Lutheran

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.330 align:middle line:84%
church, which I always
say is like Catholicism

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.993 align:middle line:90%
but without all the fun.

00:13:17.993 --> 00:13:18.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:19.730 align:middle line:90%


00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:20.620 align:middle line:90%
It's so dry.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.320 align:middle line:84%
There was no astrology,
numerology, or anything there.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Not at
that time, right?

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We weren't even
allowed to study that stuff.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.757 align:middle line:90%
And so that, I mean--

00:13:29.757 --> 00:13:32.340 align:middle line:84%
well, we're going to talk about
it when we get to Joseph Smith

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.070 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
mysticism did continue on.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.980 align:middle line:84%
We think of the strictness,
and the rules of the day,

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.850 align:middle line:84%
and such with these
various religions.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:42.760 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about Mormonism,
Seventh Day Adventist,

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Christian Science were all
spawned from this, right?

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:45.668 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:13:45.668 --> 00:13:49.430 align:middle line:84%
There's been so much adventure
inside the American religious

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:90%
movements.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when looking
at them from the outside,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:84%
they might seem dry,
or stolid, or lifeless.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.880 align:middle line:90%
But just peel the onion back.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.320 align:middle line:90%
There's so much there.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the mystical
currents within Mormonism,

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.930 align:middle line:84%
the metaphysical teachings
within Christian Science,

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:84%
the roots of Seventh Day
Adventism within divination

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.500 align:middle line:90%
and other prophetic movements--

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.110 align:middle line:84%
these were radical,
radical movements.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Look, this is what religions do.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.030 align:middle line:84%
They form four walls
around something.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And it can seem tame, and
it can seem uninteresting.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you go back to the
roots, and if you educate kids

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.970 align:middle line:84%
about the roots, the
adventure is incredible.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And the possibilities
can still be found.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:84%
The radical voices
can still be found.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:35.440 align:middle line:90%
You just need to look for them.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, as
long as dogmatism

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.340 align:middle line:84%
hasn't completely taken
over that particular faith.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Because that's
what we do as humans.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what we do.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.505 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
this part of the story

00:14:43.505 --> 00:14:47.440 align:middle line:84%
is maybe where that
quote came in, religions,

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.870 align:middle line:90%
like laws, like sausages.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.790 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't watch the
making of them, right?

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: That's
exactly right.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.306 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
these are all morphing

00:14:54.306 --> 00:14:58.477 align:middle line:84%
because one aspect of one
faith or practice caught

00:14:58.477 --> 00:15:01.060 align:middle line:84%
hold in someone's imagination,
and they took that little piece

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:01.540 align:middle line:90%
off, right?

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.581 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:15:02.581 --> 00:15:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And, look, every religion,
ancient or modern,

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.720 align:middle line:84%
begins with supernatural
experiences.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.340 align:middle line:90%
That's an absolute fact.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's Moses
parting the Red Sea

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.530 align:middle line:84%
or Christ turning
water into wine,

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:18.680 align:middle line:84%
every religion has its
inception in the miraculous.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Now sometimes there are
contemporary religious figures,

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:84%
relatively contemporary,
like Madam H.P Blavatsky

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.610 align:middle line:84%
who's called some sort of a
huckster or carnival performer.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And my challenge to
critics is show me

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.430 align:middle line:84%
a single religion that doesn't
begin with miraculous claims.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.250 align:middle line:84%
We're able to track
these things nowadays

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.130 align:middle line:84%
because we have such
a flow of information.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.530 align:middle line:84%
But going back to
antiquity, every religion

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.720 align:middle line:84%
has its heart in
the supernatural.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So we should not be closing
doors and saying yes to this

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.820 align:middle line:84%
but no to that because if you
don't accept the miraculous,

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.030 align:middle line:84%
no religion can pass
any litmus test.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.280 align:middle line:84%
You can't accept anything
in the religious world.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
very true, I mean,

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.030 align:middle line:84%
even conservative
Christianity, you

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:02.430 align:middle line:84%
can believe in the parting of
the sea and burning bushes.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:03.650 align:middle line:90%
What's the problem here?

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.170 align:middle line:84%
What's the problem
with mysticism?

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Why should
it be so far out?

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why should
it be so far out?

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I had an
experience recently

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:10.996 align:middle line:84%
where a high school
kid from Cleveland

00:16:10.996 --> 00:16:12.620 align:middle line:84%
was writing to me
because she was doing

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.410 align:middle line:84%
a report on Ouija
boards, which is

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:16.790 align:middle line:90%
a topic I'm very interested in.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to get into that.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: I'll bet.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.610 align:middle line:90%
And she sent me some questions.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.440 align:middle line:90%
I responded to her questions.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.380 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't email her
back because the school

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.240 align:middle line:84%
had some sort of a content
filter on its Internet server.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So anything that was a cult in
content couldn't get through.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.790 align:middle line:84%
But, again, how could any kid
study any religious movement

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.260 align:middle line:90%
if you apply that standard?

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No--

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It limits us.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.180 align:middle line:90%
It limits us.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
think we've become

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.660 align:middle line:84%
overly-politically
correct on so many

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.795 align:middle line:84%
fronts now that it's just
shutting down curiosity.

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It does.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:45.920 align:middle line:90%
It shuts down curiosity.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK So this one
most people will say what?

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.180 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Mary Shelley's
"Frankenstein," how

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:84%
does that start
figuring into the story,

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.360 align:middle line:90%
the story of Frankenstein?

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right, Frankenstein.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Look, I would
encourage everybody

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:84%
to go back and read
the book "Frankenstein"

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:04.099 align:middle line:84%
because even though it was
this prototype horror story,

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and even though it
has a tragic ending,

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Mary Shelley wrote
with some sympathy

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.260 align:middle line:84%
for the character of Dr.
Frankenstein who was driven--

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.890 align:middle line:84%
just driven-- to ask these
basic human questions.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:17.690 align:middle line:90%
What is life?

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:18.349 align:middle line:90%
What is death?

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.598 align:middle line:90%
What's around the next corner?

00:17:19.598 --> 00:17:21.260 align:middle line:90%
What's over the next hill?

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And his complex of questions
led to him experimenting

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.740 align:middle line:84%
with things that were beyond
the capacity of human beings

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.330 align:middle line:84%
or of a certain
type of human being.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:33.680 align:middle line:90%
And the result was tragedy.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.950 align:middle line:84%
But the questions-- the
questions were extraordinary.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:40.010 align:middle line:84%
These are the things
that make us alive.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And people don't
often realize how

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Frankenstein,
this scientist,

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.020 align:middle line:84%
this occultic explorer,
this ultimately tragic man

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.820 align:middle line:90%
was all of us.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Mary Shelley wrote about him
with a great deal of sympathy

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:90%
because he was a questioner.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And this burning
insatiable curiosity

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.300 align:middle line:84%
was a basic aspect of
human nature within him.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.450 align:middle line:90%
It made him noble.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:03.540 align:middle line:90%
It also made him tragic.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:84%
But it was inseparable
from what made him human

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:90%
and made him great.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
wonderful description of it,

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:11.570 align:middle line:84%
and I need to go
back and read it.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:84%
American occultists, in
the very early stages,

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.360 align:middle line:84%
let's about the founding
fathers, for example.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.910 align:middle line:84%
They weren't looking
at the occult

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:20.330 align:middle line:90%
as just secret handshakes.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.630 align:middle line:84%
This was to be used for
the higher public good.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:84%
As people often talk about, and
it's true, many of the founders

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.560 align:middle line:90%
were Freemasons.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.240 align:middle line:84%
This includes George Washington,
Benjamin Franklin, Paul Revere,

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.602 align:middle line:90%
John Hancock.

00:18:36.602 --> 00:18:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is not
something sinister.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
to be frightened of.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:84%
This is a wonderful thing
because modern freemasonry

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.030 align:middle line:84%
was an organization that
celebrated and continues

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:84%
to celebrate radical ecumenism,
this ideal that people

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.750 align:middle line:84%
of different
religious backgrounds

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:58.310 align:middle line:84%
can function together, and live,
and work harmoniously together

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:00.680 align:middle line:90%
within a single organization.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Masonry was the modern
prototype for that.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And America, the
American colonies,

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.230 align:middle line:84%
this very rural
settlement, this very

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:12.020 align:middle line:84%
rural agriculturally-based
country

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:16.520 align:middle line:84%
was a place where you had few
universities, and hospitals,

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.930 align:middle line:90%
and teaching institutions.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:21.290 align:middle line:84%
So people's fraternal ties
were a major influence

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:90%
on their lives.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:25.790 align:middle line:84%
So masonry was a very
substantial influence

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:30.440 align:middle line:84%
on Washington, on Franklin,
on the development of an ethic

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.820 align:middle line:90%
of religious liberty.

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Jefferson in 1800 wrote
in a very complimentary way

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:41.780 align:middle line:84%
about the Bavarian Illuminati,
founded in Bavaria in 1776.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.130 align:middle line:90%
That year is no accident.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.590 align:middle line:84%
The historic
Illuminati, they, too,

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.900 align:middle line:84%
had this kind of
radical humanitarianism

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.970 align:middle line:84%
where they believed that
your life should not

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:54.170 align:middle line:84%
be determined by the accidents
or circumstances of your birth.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:84%
They believed in a separation
of church and state.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.520 align:middle line:84%
They believed in the pursuit
of the individual spiritual

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.320 align:middle line:90%
search.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.640 align:middle line:90%
They were not sinister.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.730 align:middle line:84%
They were embodiments of
the radical principles

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.830 align:middle line:84%
that the founders
themselves had.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And Jefferson wrote admiringly
about the Illuminati

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:15.980 align:middle line:84%
because they embodied the
standards of religious liberty

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and the veneration for
the personal search

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.960 align:middle line:84%
that Jefferson had
when he created

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:84%
the original writings that led
to our own First Amendment.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.870 align:middle line:84%
We should be looking
back on these people

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:84%
with a sense of inspiration,
with a sense of pride.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.070 align:middle line:84%
None of this was ever
sinister or evil.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.930 align:middle line:84%
They were a vessel for
precious and sacred ideas

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.320 align:middle line:84%
that have improved our
lives in the 21st century.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well let's
leave America for a moment

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.010 align:middle line:90%
and pick up on that.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:84%
How were the Bavarian
Illuminati perceived

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.320 align:middle line:90%
amongst their fellow Europeans?

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, they were
a source of deep concern

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.230 align:middle line:84%
to people who were part of
the church power structure,

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:84%
to the aristocracy because
they were anti-aristocracy.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.050 align:middle line:90%
They were anti-hierarchy.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And they believed that
the state should not

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.080 align:middle line:84%
award special rights
to any one religion

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.850 align:middle line:84%
or people of any one
religious practice.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:12.890 align:middle line:84%
So, within about
eight or nine years,

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:17.270 align:middle line:84%
the Bavarian Illuminati was
legislated out of existence

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:22.520 align:middle line:84%
because the aristocracy viewed
them as a revolutionary threat.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.374 align:middle line:84%
This was not only
during the period

00:21:24.374 --> 00:21:25.790 align:middle line:84%
of the American
Revolution, but it

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:28.940 align:middle line:84%
was right on the eve of
the French Revolution.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:32.090 align:middle line:84%
European power structures
were being upended,

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:36.170 align:middle line:84%
and the Illuminati and
Freemasonry were a part of that

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:84%
because they represented a
gathering place where people

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:84%
could talk about ideas
outside of the authority

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:45.950 align:middle line:84%
of either the church
hierarchy or the aristocracy.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:48.059 align:middle line:90%
And that was threatening.

00:21:48.059 --> 00:21:49.100 align:middle line:90%
And that was threatening.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.016 align:middle line:84%
And Europe, of course,
changed over the course

00:21:51.016 --> 00:21:52.220 align:middle line:90%
of the whole century.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did any of the members
of the Bavarian Illuminati

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.750 align:middle line:90%
make their way to the US?

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well you have
people who were fleeing--

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe
influenced, also-- yeah.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Probably they
were more of an influence.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.345 align:middle line:90%
Then they made their way.

00:22:06.345 --> 00:22:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the journey
across the Atlantic

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.100 align:middle line:84%
was still very
treacherous, and people

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:84%
who were well-paid or
were in secure positions

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.900 align:middle line:90%
tended to stay in Europe.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.880 align:middle line:84%
The people who journeyed
across the Atlantic

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:84%
usually were in some
desperate economic straits.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But, after the chaos
of the reign of terror

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:23.690 align:middle line:84%
that followed the
French Revolution,

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:27.110 align:middle line:84%
you did have a small trickle
of people who came here

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:84%
because they were interested
in practicing some

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.150 align:middle line:84%
of the occult healing arts,
and mesmerism, and some

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:35.330 align:middle line:84%
of the radical philosophies
that sort of got cut

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.820 align:middle line:84%
off and interrupted
in the chaos that

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.112 align:middle line:90%
followed the French Revolution.

00:22:39.112 --> 00:22:39.911 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:39.911 --> 00:22:41.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you on that.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:41.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to get
into some characters

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that most people have
no idea ever existed.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right on.

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'd never heard of
Mother Ann and the Shakers.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh,
they were so heroic.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Mother Ann Lee was
a Quaker girl who

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.570 align:middle line:90%
lived in Manchester, England.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And she was part of a sect
called the Shaking Quakers.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.355 align:middle line:84%
They were these
fervently-religious--

00:23:02.355 --> 00:23:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Passionate.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --Quakers,
deeply passionate.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.590 align:middle line:90%
They would speak in tongues.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.960 align:middle line:84%
They would dance in
thrall of the Holy Spirit.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.170 align:middle line:90%
They would channel.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.927 align:middle line:84%
They would hold
seances, roll around.

00:23:12.927 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Some of these things
are modern terms,

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:16.190 align:middle line:84%
but this is what
they were doing.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And mother Ann would be
accused of witchcraft.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And she would say,
enigmatically,

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.430 align:middle line:90%
the only witchcraft is sin.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And so she was getting
harassed legally,

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:29.240 align:middle line:84%
and she and about 12 followers
made the very dangerous journey

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.490 align:middle line:84%
across the Atlantic, came
to New York City in 1775,

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:36.200 align:middle line:84%
worked menial jobs,
saved up enough money--

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.220 align:middle line:84%
again, in 1776, a year we're
going to keep coming back to--

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.610 align:middle line:84%
and they founded a small colony
outside Albany, New York,

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:90%
in the Hudson Valley region.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.480 align:middle line:84%
They really began the settlement
of central New York City.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was
kind of wasteland, right?

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:50.810 align:middle line:90%
This was not pleasant land.

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:51.768 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, my god.

00:23:51.768 --> 00:23:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Not only was it wasteland,
but if you go up there today,

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:57.560 align:middle line:84%
and there are still remnants
of their colony up there,

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.770 align:middle line:90%
it's this knotty, rocky soil.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:03.322 align:middle line:84%
It gets frozen over with
frost in the winter.

00:24:03.322 --> 00:24:04.280 align:middle line:90%
It's mosquito-infested.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:04.880 align:middle line:90%
It's swampy--

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it sounded awful.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: --in the summer.

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:07.570 align:middle line:90%
I've been up there.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.500 align:middle line:84%
I've made a pilgrimage
to Mother Anne's grave,

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.560 align:middle line:84%
a very simple gravestone with
just the name Mother Ann Lee

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.370 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.940 align:middle line:84%
But these people risked
so much physically

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.830 align:middle line:84%
because they believed,
and they wanted

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:20.930 align:middle line:84%
to found a little
colony where they were

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:23.570 align:middle line:90%
free to search as they wished.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And that is at the heart of so
much of America's development.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And so they founded
this small colony.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.930 align:middle line:90%
They survived the winters.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:84%
People came to
visit, got inspired

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:37.880 align:middle line:84%
by what they were doing, and
founded different colonies.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.060 align:middle line:84%
There were two men from the
town of New Lebanon, New York,

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.120 align:middle line:84%
a town in upstate New York,
that broke through a spring thaw

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.740 align:middle line:90%
to visit Mother Ann Lee.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And they saw her
and her pilgrims

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:48.290 align:middle line:90%
surviving in the woods.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:49.690 align:middle line:90%
And they said, who are you?

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And Mother Ann said
we are the people that

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.570 align:middle line:90%
turned the world upside-down.

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And, with that, these
men were so inspired

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.580 align:middle line:84%
that they founded
another Shaker village.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And these things spread as far
north as Maine, as far south

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.580 align:middle line:90%
as Kentucky.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.050 align:middle line:90%
It helped settle the country.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:08.091 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And none of us
have ever heard of that.

00:25:08.091 --> 00:25:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And this next part that
I'm going to mention

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.560 align:middle line:90%
is really interesting.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.010 align:middle line:90%
You can maybe set it up.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.725 align:middle line:84%
We just set up that area,
the Burned-over district

00:25:15.725 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:90%
and what that meant.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: The
Burned-over district

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.860 align:middle line:84%
was a swath of land in
Central New York state

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.660 align:middle line:84%
between the cities of Buffalo
in the West and Albany

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.710 align:middle line:90%
in the East.

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was a place
that was settled

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:31.690 align:middle line:84%
by many different mystical
movements, including

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:35.230 align:middle line:84%
the Shakers, including the
followers of a Rhode Island

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:37.930 align:middle line:84%
spirit channeler who called
herself the Public Universal

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Friend--

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
coming to her next.

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.123 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, yes.

00:25:40.123 --> 00:25:42.130 align:middle line:84%
It was a very fertile
region of land.

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:45.640 align:middle line:84%
It had been home to
the Iroquois nation,

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.750 align:middle line:84%
but the Iroquois made an
ill-fated military alliance

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.330 align:middle line:84%
with the British during
the War of Independence.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And after the war was over,
the colonial government, which

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:58.650 align:middle line:84%
was looking for an excuse
to push them off that land,

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:00.040 align:middle line:90%
they found their excuse.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.457 align:middle line:84%
And they pushed the Iroquois
off that land, opened it to--

00:26:02.457 --> 00:26:03.623 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As public enemies.

00:26:03.623 --> 00:26:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right, exactly.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.024 align:middle line:84%
Opened it to development,
and liberal New Englanders

00:26:08.024 --> 00:26:09.940 align:middle line:84%
and religious seekers,
and all kinds of people

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.680 align:middle line:90%
flooded into New York state.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And for about a generation
in the first half

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.610 align:middle line:84%
of the 19th century, it
became the springboard

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.560 align:middle line:84%
for every movement
you've mentioned.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Every movement you've mentioned
can trace its roots back

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:25.060 align:middle line:90%
to the Burned-over district.

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And why is it called
the Burner-over district?

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
nobody exactly knows.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.050 align:middle line:84%
But the legend is that two
ministers were talking.

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And one said to the
other he planned

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.380 align:middle line:84%
to go, and preach, and ride
the circuit through central New

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:37.180 align:middle line:90%
York.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And the other minister said,
oh, don't bother going there.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.620 align:middle line:84%
That place has
already burned over,

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.780 align:middle line:84%
by which he meant there's
nobody left there to convert.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Everybody belongs to some
church, or sect, or group,

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.050 align:middle line:90%
or has some channeler.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:51.250 align:middle line:90%
It's been burned over.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:52.792 align:middle line:84%
Everybody there
belongs to something.

00:26:52.792 --> 00:26:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Now other people interpret
that as meaning it's

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.730 align:middle line:84%
been burned over by the
fires of the spirit.

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:57.790 align:middle line:90%
Nobody really knows.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:00.310 align:middle line:84%
But the phrase came
into use in newspapers

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:02.180 align:middle line:90%
in the early 19th century.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.564 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In this area, I
mean, obviously every person

00:27:04.564 --> 00:27:05.980 align:middle line:84%
you're talking
about here would be

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:09.936 align:middle line:84%
considered in very extreme
terms as, at least, eccentric.

00:27:09.936 --> 00:27:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: At least.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At least.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: And, yet--

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --fervent eccentrics.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: These
are our ancestors.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:84%
These are our
American ancestors.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you look, the
settlement of our country--

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:20.680 align:middle line:84%
the Westward
Settlement-- it really

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.430 align:middle line:84%
began in central New York state
because you had this dirt road

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:26.800 align:middle line:84%
there, Route 20, which
is now the longest

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.540 align:middle line:90%
continuous road in America.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.440 align:middle line:90%
It's actually not Route 66.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:90%
It's Route 20.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.930 align:middle line:84%
It goes from Boston
to Eugene, Oregon.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:38.320 align:middle line:84%
That road began, at the time,
in central New York state.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.970 align:middle line:90%
And it was used--

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.610 align:middle line:84%
there was one historian who
called it a psychic highway.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:45.580 align:middle line:84%
People not only
spread down that road

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.635 align:middle line:84%
to settle America
agriculturally and commercially,

00:27:48.635 --> 00:27:50.260 align:middle line:84%
but they brought
their ideas with them.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So you found mystical ideas
dotting the countryside.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:56.872 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We go now to
Public Universal Friend.

00:27:56.872 --> 00:27:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Ah, yes,
one of my favorites.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Jemima.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Jemima
Wilkinson, she

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:04.540 align:middle line:84%
was a young woman who grew up
in a fairly-prosperous Quaker

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:06.460 align:middle line:90%
family in Rhode Island.

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:11.290 align:middle line:90%
And she took to her bed in 1775.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:12.332 align:middle line:90%
She was in her early 20s.

00:28:12.332 --> 00:28:13.998 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The same
period of time, yeah.

00:28:13.998 --> 00:28:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Exactly,
same period of time.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.260 align:middle line:84%
She was suffering
from typhus fever.

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.300 align:middle line:84%
People thought she
was going to die.

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.960 align:middle line:90%
And she was in bed.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.660 align:middle line:84%
She was slipping in
and out of a coma.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.910 align:middle line:84%
She was having
these fever dreams.

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And when her family
was absolutely

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:33.520 align:middle line:84%
sure she was all but gone
and was sitting in a death

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.490 align:middle line:84%
vigil around her bed,
she suddenly springs

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:40.330 align:middle line:84%
up all ruddy, and red-faced,
and filled with energy.

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And she says to her shocked
Quaker household, the woman

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.220 align:middle line:84%
that you knew as
Jemima is now gone, has

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.750 align:middle line:90%
traveled to the spirit world.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:51.790 align:middle line:84%
But the being
standing before you

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:55.090 align:middle line:84%
has been incarnated by an
angel and will answer only

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:58.450 align:middle line:84%
to the name Public
Universal Friend.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:00.850 align:middle line:84%
So, suddenly, Jemima,
now under the name--

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's called a
walk-in in today's parlance.

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Exactly, a walk-in.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.750 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:05.860 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And so Jemima
starts going around

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:11.800 align:middle line:84%
first the state of Rhode Island
and then other parts of New

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.830 align:middle line:84%
England speaking, giving
homilies in church yards

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:15.940 align:middle line:90%
after services.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:19.600 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time
Americans had seen

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.520 align:middle line:90%
a woman speaking in public.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:26.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's difficult for
people to understand today.

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:31.550 align:middle line:84%
But the occult
movements were running

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:34.320 align:middle line:84%
hand-in-hand with other
avant garde movements

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.350 align:middle line:84%
and, in some cases,
were creating them.

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:39.770 align:middle line:84%
The movement for
women's emancipation

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.080 align:middle line:84%
began through these
occult religious movements

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.510 align:middle line:84%
because they pried
apart tradition.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:46.460 align:middle line:90%
They pried open doors.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Jemima Wilkinson, the
Public Universal Friend

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:54.230 align:middle line:84%
was, in fact, the first female
religious figure in America.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And here she is walking
around saying I am--

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.720 align:middle line:84%
she's basically a
channeler, or a walk-in,

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:03.470 align:middle line:84%
being inhabited by some
angel or higher spirit.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And, eventually, her
followers said, well,

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:09.372 align:middle line:84%
we want to start a colony for
the Public Universal Friend,

00:30:09.372 --> 00:30:11.330 align:middle line:84%
just like the Shakers
have done, just like some

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:13.130 align:middle line:84%
of these other religious
groups have done,

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.020 align:middle line:84%
just like the Kelpius
people have done.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.250 align:middle line:90%
So where did they go?

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Into central New
York state, and they

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.910 align:middle line:90%
found a town called Jerusalem.

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:22.880 align:middle line:84%
These people weren't kidding
around, which is still there

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.720 align:middle line:90%
to this day.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And they built Jemima a
mansion, which is still there.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And they began to
settle central New York

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:33.290 align:middle line:84%
state on some very recognizable
names in American life,

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:36.560 align:middle line:84%
like Ingraham, were
originally followers

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.330 align:middle line:90%
of the Public Universal Friend.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Her movement had a lot of
wealthy and influential people,

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.087 align:middle line:84%
including judges and merchants,
who believed her story.

00:30:44.087 --> 00:30:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What as the
nature of her message?

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.336 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It's
very interesting.

00:30:47.336 --> 00:30:49.490 align:middle line:10%
The Shakers tended
to be for poor folks.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:53.060 align:middle line:10%
The Shakers were for farmers,
laborers, people who occupied

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.450 align:middle line:10%
the back pews of the church.

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:58.190 align:middle line:84%
But the Public
Universal Friend, she

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:00.830 align:middle line:84%
grew up in a prosperous
Quaker household.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So, for that reason,
she always seemed

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.990 align:middle line:84%
to attract people who were from
the upper echelons of society.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:09.420 align:middle line:84%
So, even then, there were kind
of these class differences

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.320 align:middle line:84%
where the Shakers were like
a working people's movement.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.270 align:middle line:84%
That was working
folks' mysticism.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:17.439 align:middle line:84%
And the Friend, that was more
like gentleman and ladies.

00:31:17.439 --> 00:31:19.105 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A little
more elite mysticism.

00:31:19.105 --> 00:31:20.438 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: A little more elite.

00:31:20.438 --> 00:31:23.300 align:middle line:84%
But it began to
wield an influence

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:26.270 align:middle line:84%
on both sides of the nation,
both the laboring folk

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and the people who
were calling the shots,

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:30.470 align:middle line:90%
making the decisions.

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And, again, they fanned out
across central New York state.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.030 align:middle line:90%
They moved into Philadelphia.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Other parts of the country
began to move west,

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.100 align:middle line:84%
began to move south,
settled the nation.

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what, ultimately,
besides being the first woman,

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.189 align:middle line:84%
was her legacy in terms
of the work she did

00:31:44.189 --> 00:31:45.230 align:middle line:90%
and what she left behind?

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:47.219 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: That's
a great question.

00:31:47.219 --> 00:31:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Most people, of course, haven't
heard of the Public Universal

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.899 align:middle line:90%
Friend today.

00:31:50.899 --> 00:31:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that's
going to change any time soon,

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:54.250 align:middle line:90%
despite my best efforts.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Unless
they read your book.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.258 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: But she did leave
a legacy, and it was twofold.

00:31:58.258 --> 00:32:04.700 align:middle line:84%
One was she became the nation's
first female religious figure.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And she was actually
able-- she was maybe

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:10.040 align:middle line:84%
one of the only figures in
the country at the time who

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.740 align:middle line:84%
was able to preach both to
revolutionary and British

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.540 align:middle line:90%
troops.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.005 align:middle line:90%
She would cross among lines.

00:32:16.005 --> 00:32:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she had
a universal message?

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.254 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: She did have
a universal message.

00:32:20.254 --> 00:32:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And she also inspired
in people, ignited

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:29.660 align:middle line:84%
in people the idea that these
new religious sects and groups

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:32.630 align:middle line:84%
could take root in America,
could succeed in America,

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:35.690 align:middle line:84%
could be financially,
and spiritually,

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:38.030 align:middle line:90%
and socially viable.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And so different
movements spun-off.

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Once Americans see
somebody doing something,

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.455 align:middle line:84%
the first question they
ask is how can I do that?

00:32:46.455 --> 00:32:47.880 align:middle line:90%
And how can I make it better?

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:48.860 align:middle line:90%
And how can I make it bigger?

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And how can I make
it more practical?

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.460 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be something in
the American consciousness.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And so these movements would
give birth to other movements.

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And the Friend set kind
of a tone for avant

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.270 align:middle line:84%
garde spirituality and
communicated to other men

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:07.962 align:middle line:84%
and women in the Burned-over
district, you can do this, too.

00:33:07.962 --> 00:33:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did she have
any well-known followers

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.770 align:middle line:90%
in the end?

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything that
was spawned seriously off

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:14.600 align:middle line:84%
of that or just the
seeding of this thought?

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.725 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I would say
the seeding of the thought.

00:33:16.725 --> 00:33:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I would say figures who came
later, like Joseph Smith and--

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're
going there next.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.295 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, yeah.

00:33:21.295 --> 00:33:24.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that they stood
on her shoulders to some extent

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:28.300 align:middle line:84%
because it was clear
that this could be done.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:30.510 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of like when
rock and roll got unlocked.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, everybody wanted
to be in a rock band.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can make
religion for everyone.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.961 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:33:34.961 --> 00:33:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And it also brought a kind
of do-it-yourself ethos

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.610 align:middle line:84%
to religion that ancient
prophets and seers

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:46.420 align:middle line:84%
didn't all belong to
biblical antiquity

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.650 align:middle line:84%
but could be experienced
in the here and now.

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And that was very
moving to Americans.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.498 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, indeed.

00:33:51.498 --> 00:33:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And, speaking of seers,
let's go on to Joseph Smith

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.286 align:middle line:84%
and what an interesting
character he was.

00:33:56.286 --> 00:33:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Amazing figure.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
again, look at today

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and look at how things are
perceived by the public today

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.270 align:middle line:90%
regarding Mormonism.

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:05.600 align:middle line:90%
He was the Godfather.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.340 align:middle line:90%
He was the creator of Mormonism.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we have
varying views on that.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And here, let's look at
where it all came from.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.739 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Now, Joseph
Smith is a young man

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:17.540 align:middle line:84%
who grew up in the
same neighborhood

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.179 align:middle line:84%
as Jemima Wilkinson,
central New York state.

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:22.330 align:middle line:84%
He was raised just
outside of Rochester.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Now he had a family who was very
steeped in the supernatural.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Astrology and different
remnants of the European occult

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:32.540 align:middle line:84%
were very popular
in his household.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.870 align:middle line:84%
He used to wear a
silver medallion

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:38.679 align:middle line:84%
with the astrological symbol
of Jupiter carved into it,

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:41.730 align:middle line:84%
which was considered to
be a blessed influence,

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:43.540 align:middle line:90%
a blessed planet for him.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Smith reported that he was
visited by an angel of God who

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:49.630 align:middle line:84%
led him to a new
book of scripture,

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:51.190 align:middle line:84%
which he called the
"Book of Mormon"

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and released to
the world in 1830.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And he founded one of the
fastest-growing religions

00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:58.810 align:middle line:90%
of modern life.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Smith not only came
from a household that

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.430 align:middle line:84%
was steeped in the
supernaturalism

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:06.790 align:middle line:84%
of the Burned-over district,
but he was deeply enticed

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:10.660 align:middle line:84%
with Freemasonry, and with
the rights, and rituals,

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.160 align:middle line:90%
and symbols of Freemasonry.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Smith believed
that the Freemasons

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:19.750 align:middle line:84%
had reconstructed some
of the priestly rituals

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:20.890 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient world.

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:25.630 align:middle line:84%
He believed that some of the
rituals of the Hebrew priests

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:27.790 align:middle line:90%
had been preserved--

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:32.080 align:middle line:84%
maybe not in unbroken form but,
in part, within Freemasonry.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So he used rites and
rituals from Freemasonry

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and incorporated them into
the liturgy and the practices

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:40.330 align:middle line:90%
of the Mormon church.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:42.010 align:middle line:84%
So we think of the
Mormon church today

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.530 align:middle line:84%
as being this fairly
conservative institution.

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And, politically,
that's certainly true.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.640 align:middle line:84%
But members of the Mormon
church, who I love,

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.325 align:middle line:84%
and who I have in my own family,
they're very open to the ideas

00:35:52.325 --> 00:35:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that you and I have
been talking about.

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's really a
cosmic religion when you start

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:56.830 align:middle line:90%
speaking, it's--

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely
It's a cosmic religion.

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is some of the
church fathers in Salt Lake

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:06.280 align:middle line:84%
City may not like this, but it's
an enormously well-read faith.

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And the rank and file faithful,
I've found, are very into this.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a religion founded by a
prophet in central New York

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.090 align:middle line:84%
state who was into
astrology, and Freemasonry,

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:16.890 align:middle line:90%
and who was a--

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And astronomy and
who was a cosmologist, really.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.698 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And,
as a young man, he

00:36:20.698 --> 00:36:23.140 align:middle line:84%
had a reputation as a
local clairvoyant who

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:27.250 align:middle line:84%
would use what he called seer
stones to find buried treasure

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:28.690 align:middle line:90%
and to foretell the future.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And some of the aspects
of the "Book of Mormon"

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.990 align:middle line:84%
reflect folklore
that was very popular

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:37.450 align:middle line:84%
in the Burned-over
districts, such as the idea

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:41.140 align:middle line:84%
of an ancient civilization
once occupying the area,

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.955 align:middle line:84%
older than the
oldest Indian tribe.

00:36:42.955 --> 00:36:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Now some people look at
the "Book of Mormon,"

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:46.390 align:middle line:84%
and they say, oh,
well, you know,

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:50.020 align:middle line:84%
this local kid was just
imbibing and reprocessing

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.130 align:middle line:90%
local folklore.

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I think he was doing
something much more than that,

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's in the
eye of the beholder

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.220 align:middle line:84%
whether that folklore
is reprocessed

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.320 align:middle line:84%
in the "Book of
Mormon" or validated

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.490 align:middle line:90%
by the "Book of Mormon."

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:03.520 align:middle line:84%
But what I find is that rank
and file members of the Mormon

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.541 align:middle line:84%
church, they're enormously
well-read and deeply curious.

00:37:07.541 --> 00:37:09.040 align:middle line:84%
But all the things
we're discussing,

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.040 align:middle line:90%
it is a cosmic religion.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is,
but then it gets

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:14.027 align:middle line:84%
laden down when the
practices of polygamy,

00:37:14.027 --> 00:37:15.610 align:middle line:84%
and the new world,
and states come in.

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:18.490 align:middle line:90%


00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:20.620 align:middle line:84%
How was that reconciled
into the story?

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
look, this is what

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.530 align:middle line:90%
humans do in a certain sense.

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:29.050 align:middle line:84%
We create a dogma, or somebody
has a certain practice,

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:30.790 align:middle line:84%
somebody has a
certain experience.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And we immediately want to place
fences and rules around it.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And, also, Joseph
Smith, who I think

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:38.290 align:middle line:84%
was a great man, and
a spiritual genius,

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:40.380 align:middle line:84%
and a profoundly
brave person was also

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.520 align:middle line:90%
a profoundly-flawed person.

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And he was moving west,
fleeing persecution himself,

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:48.670 align:middle line:84%
trying to hold
together what could be,

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:50.647 align:middle line:90%
at times, an unruly flock.

00:37:50.647 --> 00:37:52.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, read the "Old
Testament" if you want

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.370 align:middle line:90%
to know about an unruly flock.

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's not exactly
unprecedented

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:57.190 align:middle line:90%
in our religious history.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:59.950 align:middle line:10%
He was dealing with
threats all around him,

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:02.410 align:middle line:10%
and he dealt with
them poorly sometimes.

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there was an
autocratic nature to the man.

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I can't find an exception
to that in American History

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.060 align:middle line:90%
or in human history.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:10.960 align:middle line:90%
There were failures.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:90%
There were imperfections.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.560 align:middle line:10%
There were, at
times, brutalities.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.380 align:middle line:10%
We have to understand this,
and be mature about it,

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.550 align:middle line:10%
and acknowledge it.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:21.220 align:middle line:84%
But it also doesn't
mean that we dismiss

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.970 align:middle line:84%
the entire religious enterprise
of Smith and his followers

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:28.520 align:middle line:84%
because that's what the
making of religions look like.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.329 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
sausage is, exactly.

00:38:30.329 --> 00:38:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: We get
to watch it today.

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:33.820 align:middle line:90%
We get to experience it.

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:35.300 align:middle line:90%
That's what human history is.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.383 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
what happened with him.

00:38:37.383 --> 00:38:40.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what a
profoundly-strange ending

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:41.540 align:middle line:90%
to his life.

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.359 align:middle line:84%
I mean he was a young
man, 38 years old.

00:38:43.359 --> 00:38:44.650 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about what happened.

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: He was
he was a young man.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:50.920 align:middle line:84%
By this point, his flock
had spread to the Midwest.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.020 align:middle line:84%
There were local
municipalities who

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.520 align:middle line:90%
felt threatened by Mormonism.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.910 align:middle line:84%
He was imprisoned largely
on specious charges.

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:00.367 align:middle line:84%
There was a mob that gathered
outside the jailhouse.

00:39:00.367 --> 00:39:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now where was
he imprisoned again?

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It was in Illinois.

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Illinois, OK.

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And he
was under threat

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:12.100 align:middle line:84%
from a mob that was breaking
into the local jailhouse.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And just as the mob was
storming the jailhouse,

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.960 align:middle line:90%
he was trying to escape.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.810 align:middle line:84%
He appeared in the
window of the jailhouse

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:23.100 align:middle line:84%
from the second floor, and
he issued a Masonic distress

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:23.900 align:middle line:90%
symbol.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.260 align:middle line:84%
He crossed his hands
above his head.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Lord, have
mercy on the widow's son."

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:31.250 align:middle line:84%
He jumped from the window,
and he was shot to death

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:32.240 align:middle line:90%
in a hail of bullets.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Now Smith really did give
his life for his flock

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:39.380 align:middle line:84%
because when they were under
siege, he could have escaped.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:40.730 align:middle line:90%
He could have gotten away.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:45.050 align:middle line:84%
But he returned back to where
his flock was because they were

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:48.380 align:middle line:84%
in danger, and he didn't
feel that he should just

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.420 align:middle line:84%
run off like some
prince in the night

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and leave other people to
suffer the brunt of persecution

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.580 align:middle line:90%
and violence he suffered.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.320 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult
for people today

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.110 align:middle line:84%
to understand what life
was like back then.

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:01.850 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't that long ago.

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:03.920 align:middle line:84%
But it was a more
brutal existence,

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and it summoned from people
who they really were.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And people
didn't like other.

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: No.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:12.230 align:middle line:84%
There was tremendous suspicion,
there was tremendous dislike.

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And, again, even the people
who were pointing the fingers,

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:15.980 align:middle line:90%
they had their reasons.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.830 align:middle line:84%
It was a hand-to-mouth
existence, issues of power

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:21.020 align:middle line:84%
where sometimes life
and death issues, issues

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.570 align:middle line:84%
of water rights
and access to land

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:24.950 align:middle line:90%
were life and death issues.

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:27.080 align:middle line:84%
It was a more
brutal way of life.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.050 align:middle line:84%
But I think there was a
heroic dimension to Smith

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:31.310 align:middle line:90%
that can't be denied.

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
his body was taken,

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.695 align:middle line:84%
it still had his
medallion of Jupiter.

00:40:36.695 --> 00:40:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's correct.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.100 align:middle line:84%
It had the silver
medallion of Jupiter

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:43.460 align:middle line:84%
on it that had been
his since he was a kid.

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So you can't sweep the
occult nature of Smith

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:47.510 align:middle line:90%
under the rug either.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's no reason to
sweep it under the rug.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:53.540 align:middle line:84%
He was a son of the
supernatural traditions

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:54.710 align:middle line:90%
of the Burned-over district.

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:57.350 align:middle line:90%
And there's greatness in that.

00:40:57.350 --> 00:40:58.790 align:middle line:84%
No one should be
ashamed of that,

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:02.362 align:middle line:84%
no member of the Mormon
faith, a church that I love.

00:41:02.362 --> 00:41:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
great destiny hanging

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:04.871 align:middle line:90%
over that church.

00:41:04.871 --> 00:41:06.745 align:middle line:84%
No one should feel they
have to run from that

00:41:06.745 --> 00:41:07.730 align:middle line:90%
or hide from that.

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:10.570 align:middle line:84%
He was a son of the
Burned-over district.

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go to Seneca
tribal leader, Red Jacket.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:19.790 align:middle line:84%
This was fascinating to me
because America's other, even

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:23.530 align:middle line:84%
historical background
aside from religions,

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.140 align:middle line:84%
we can't even begin
to scratch it.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So Red Jacket, and
what he was wearing,

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.020 align:middle line:90%
and how did that get there?

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.936 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely
fascinating, Red Jacket

00:41:30.936 --> 00:41:34.570 align:middle line:84%
was a Seneca Indian leader
in the Burner-over district.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And he and his
immediate followers

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:41.050 align:middle line:84%
wore metallic insignias
on their clothes

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:43.420 align:middle line:90%
that were Freemasonic medals.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And New York state's Governor
Clinton Dewitt wrote a book

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and gave talks about
vestiges of ancient masonry

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:55.840 align:middle line:84%
among the Indian tribes
of central New York state.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.300 align:middle line:84%
Now nobody knows
how this came about,

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.660 align:middle line:84%
why the Seneca Indians were
wearing Masonic medals.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Had they been inducted
into a Masonic lodge

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:06.610 align:middle line:84%
by colonists or
by British troops?

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:07.690 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:09.340 align:middle line:90%
Or was something else going on?

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:11.500 align:middle line:84%
But it was
enormously-intriguing,

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:14.180 align:middle line:84%
and it remains a
historical mystery.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:18.370 align:middle line:84%
So, diving into
Freemasonry, what

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:21.760 align:middle line:84%
it left behind in Europe,
what it attempted to establish

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.740 align:middle line:90%
in early America, to start?

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Freemasonry
is a brotherhood

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:31.180 align:middle line:84%
that I think, preserved
in its rights and rituals

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and continues to today,
some of the ideas

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:38.650 align:middle line:84%
that were coming out of
the occult experimentation

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:39.580 align:middle line:90%
in the Renaissance.

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:43.810 align:middle line:84%
The Renaissance mind was
rediscovering ancient ideas,

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:49.420 align:middle line:84%
translating them into
accessible romance languages,

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:53.890 align:middle line:84%
viewing the philosophies,
the mystery religions,

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:55.930 align:middle line:84%
the secret rites
and rituals that

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:59.290 align:middle line:84%
remained in fragmentary
form from ancient Egypt,

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:01.180 align:middle line:90%
Rome, Greece for the first time.

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:04.300 align:middle line:10%
So there was this
explosion of realization

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:07.450 align:middle line:10%
that there was
this whole theology

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:10.900 align:middle line:10%
and spirituality that that
predated Christianity,

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:13.210 align:middle line:10%
that predated Judaism.

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And the Renaissance
mind was absolutely

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.600 align:middle line:90%
set on fire with this.

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I think what you
find in Freemasonry

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.620 align:middle line:84%
is a conglomeration,
a grouping, of seekers

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:26.680 align:middle line:84%
who wanted to preserve
some of these ideas

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.110 align:middle line:84%
after the backlash
that followed,

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:31.790 align:middle line:84%
say, the death of
Queen Elizabeth.

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:34.060 align:middle line:84%
It was a fairly
liberal monarch that

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:35.980 align:middle line:84%
followed the advent
of the 30 Years

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:39.850 align:middle line:84%
War in the early 1600s,
which really represented

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:43.390 align:middle line:84%
a backlash against some
of these philosophies.

00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Freemasons had to stay
secretive in Europe

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.970 align:middle line:84%
because they were,
in many cases,

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:52.490 align:middle line:84%
running afoul of the legal
system, the churches.

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:53.390 align:middle line:90%
They were outlawed.

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:58.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were advocating
a form of religious liberty,

00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:01.720 align:middle line:84%
separation of church
and state, acceptance

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.610 align:middle line:90%
of all monotheistic faiths.

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:07.670 align:middle line:84%
That was not only against social
mores, but against the law,

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:09.970 align:middle line:84%
and could have earned
you a jail sentence.

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:12.370 align:middle line:84%
So they had very good
reason to be secretive.

00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:15.970 align:middle line:84%
In America, they were
a little less secretive

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:19.870 align:middle line:84%
because the society, such as
it was in the colonial days,

00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:21.430 align:middle line:90%
was more open.

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:25.060 align:middle line:84%
But their influence in America--
the real Masonic influence,

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.740 align:middle line:84%
I think was found
most profoundly

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.170 align:middle line:84%
in America because
it needed kind

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:32.740 align:middle line:84%
of a rural place, a
fresh slate to take root.

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:34.210 align:middle line:90%
And it did take root.

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we can
count so many Freemasons

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.840 align:middle line:84%
among George
Washington's generals,

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.870 align:middle line:84%
among the Founding Fathers,
among many presidents,

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:46.390 align:middle line:84%
although that has petered
out, unfortunately

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:47.560 align:middle line:90%
from my perspective.

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:51.160 align:middle line:84%
The last American president who
was a full-fledged Freemason

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.280 align:middle line:90%
was the mysterious Gerald Ford.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Bill Clinton had been a member
of a Masonic youth group,

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.740 align:middle line:90%
but he never became a Mason.

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And, since then, the
influence has not

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:04.564 align:middle line:84%
been felt in that
particular way.

00:45:04.564 --> 00:45:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about what

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.050 align:middle line:84%
happened because
in America today,

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:11.980 align:middle line:84%
of course, and, again, among
conspiracy community members,

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.290 align:middle line:84%
in particular, this
is a feared word.

00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:15.160 align:middle line:90%
It's reviled.

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And this started
actually a long time ago.

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:20.320 align:middle line:84%
This isn't something
new in it's perception.

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.829 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about William Morgan.

00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:25.000 align:middle line:84%
William Morgan,
wouldn't you know,

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.470 align:middle line:84%
just happened to
be a Freemason who

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:29.240 align:middle line:84%
was living in the Burned-over
district outside of Rochester,

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.930 align:middle line:84%
New York, the sleepy little
Burned-over district.

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And, in the early 1820s,
he got into a dispute

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.950 align:middle line:84%
with some local
Freemasonic lodges

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and claimed that he was going
to prepare a manuscript that

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:45.670 align:middle line:84%
advertised some of the secret
rituals of Freemasonry.

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why was
he angry with him?

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.955 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: He wasn't being
given the membership privileges

00:45:48.955 --> 00:45:49.910 align:middle line:90%
he felt he was afforded?

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So that was it?

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It was
just a local conflict?

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's I'm
going to tell on you?

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right.

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:54.580 align:middle line:90%
It was a local conflict.

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:55.510 align:middle line:90%
And he said, fine.

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:56.552 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to tell on you.

00:45:56.552 --> 00:45:57.351 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:45:57.351 --> 00:45:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'll prepare a manuscript
that discloses your secrets.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, William Morgan
showed up dead in 1826.

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And he was rumored to have
been killed by local renegade

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Freemasons.

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:11.130 align:middle line:90%
We don't really know.

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:14.350 align:middle line:84%
But there was a mood of
populism sweeping the country

00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:15.150 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:17.880 align:middle line:84%
We were about to elect
Andrew Jackson president who,

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.640 align:middle line:84%
by the way, was a
Freemason himself.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And people were concerned
about privileges

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:28.710 align:middle line:84%
being granted to the
wealthy, about corruption

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:30.000 align:middle line:90%
within the legal system.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.186 align:middle line:90%
These were popula--

00:46:31.186 --> 00:46:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Undue influence--

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Undue influence.

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --over the
elite or among the elite.

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's it, exactly.

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And people were
fearful and angry

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:44.100 align:middle line:84%
that the elite, the financial
and political elite of society

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.850 align:middle line:84%
were rigging the deck
against the ordinary person,

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:49.410 align:middle line:90%
ordinary household.

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Now because of the timing
of William Morgan's death,

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:56.400 align:middle line:84%
all of this kind of got
bound up with Freemasonry.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And people began to
fear that masonry

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.490 align:middle line:84%
was this kind of secretive
gathering place where

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:06.390 align:middle line:84%
the elite was planning, and
plotting, and handing out

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:07.860 align:middle line:90%
favors, and so forth.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And, already, some
of this thought

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:12.660 align:middle line:84%
was stirring in Europe because
the French Revolution, when

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:16.080 align:middle line:84%
it occurred, seemed
to happen so suddenly

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and seemed to up-end
French life so completely

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.590 align:middle line:84%
that some theorists
thought there

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:25.200 align:middle line:84%
must have been some hidden
hand behind all this.

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Something must have been at
work here behind the scenes.

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:31.770 align:middle line:84%
The same thing was said
100 years later at the time

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:33.240 align:middle line:90%
of the Russian Revolution.

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look, to people who
weren't paying attention

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.750 align:middle line:84%
and who hadn't paid attention
to the social fissures and all

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:41.730 align:middle line:84%
the problems that
were brewing up

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:44.290 align:middle line:84%
just below the
surface of society,

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:46.500 align:middle line:84%
these things could
seem very sudden.

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.290 align:middle line:84%
So the French Revolution
seemed sudden.

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:53.730 align:middle line:84%
People in America were angry
about the perceived privileges

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:55.230 align:middle line:90%
being given to elites.

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:59.400 align:middle line:84%
They elected Andrew Jackson who
was supposed to clean house.

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.420 align:middle line:90%
Again, never mind.

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:02.340 align:middle line:90%
He was a Freemason himself.

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And so people began, in America,
to have sinister associations

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.360 align:middle line:90%
with Freemasonry.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, around this
time, Joseph Smith

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.970 align:middle line:84%
is putting together his
religion of Mormonism.

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:21.060 align:middle line:84%
He marries the widow of
William Morgan, moves

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.020 align:middle line:90%
out west with her.

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.750 align:middle line:84%
She becomes one of his
several brides at the time,

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:27.510 align:middle line:84%
further solidifying
Joseph Smith's connection

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:29.010 align:middle line:90%
to Freemasonry.

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And, as he moves out west, all
these anti-masonic newspapers

00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:35.390 align:middle line:84%
and political parties
begin to dot the US.

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:36.890 align:middle line:84%
There were literally
dozens of them.

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you said in your
book that 52 anti-masonic

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:39.790 align:middle line:90%
newspapers--

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:41.165 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Can
you believe that?

00:48:41.165 --> 00:48:43.112 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --popped up,
dedicated to suspicion

00:48:43.112 --> 00:48:44.070 align:middle line:90%
surrounding this group.

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:45.111 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:48:45.111 --> 00:48:46.770 align:middle line:84%
There were 52
anti-masonic newspapers.

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:48.930 align:middle line:84%
That were anti-masonic
political parties.

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, eventually, the
fervor died down,

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and the country moved
on to other concerns.

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:57.420 align:middle line:84%
By the 1840s, Americans were
involved with other things

00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:02.330 align:middle line:84%
and had other issues facing
them, including abolitionism.

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:06.420 align:middle line:84%
But that probably marked
the steady decline

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:09.090 align:middle line:84%
of Masonic influence over
our political system.

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And I would say to people who
are involved in conspiracy

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:14.370 align:middle line:84%
theories and feel that
masonry and the Illuminati

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:16.560 align:middle line:84%
had some sinister
hand in our affairs,

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:17.760 align:middle line:90%
just look back at them.

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Look back at the history
of their principles,

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.620 align:middle line:84%
the quest for religious
liberty, the quest

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:28.560 align:middle line:84%
to break free of
the aristocracy,

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:32.010 align:middle line:84%
the quest to separate
political power, and rank,

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and privilege from
the accident of birth.

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Those were the
animating passions

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:39.566 align:middle line:84%
of the Freemasons
and the Illuminati.

00:49:39.566 --> 00:49:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Those are things we
should be proud of.

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:46.530 align:middle line:84%
We should look at these figures
as ancestors in the quest

00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:51.120 align:middle line:84%
to preserve the freedom of
individual spiritual search.

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And the individual search
for meaning, I think,

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:57.240 align:middle line:84%
is the greatest principle on
which America was founded.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.450 align:middle line:84%
That's the principle that
figures like Washington and Ben

00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Franklin took from
masonry, the protection

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:05.050 align:middle line:84%
of the individual
search for meaning.

00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:06.345 align:middle line:90%
That's a legacy of masonry.

00:50:06.345 --> 00:50:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Those were the seeds.

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Those were the seeds.

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.070 align:middle line:84%
However, like all
things, certainly there

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:15.010 align:middle line:84%
is evolution and devolution of
all things, so it can morph.

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:17.710 align:middle line:84%
It can become bastardized along
the way, like any movement,

00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:17.930 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah,
like any movement.

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I think you sometimes found that
more in Europe than in the US.

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:27.000 align:middle line:84%
I think, in Europe,
Freemasonry, in some instances,

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.440 align:middle line:84%
has devolved into a kind
of an old boys club.

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.000 align:middle line:84%
You find that in
Italy, for example,

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.170 align:middle line:90%
and you find exceptions.

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:35.310 align:middle line:90%
And you find exceptions.

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:38.390 align:middle line:84%
In America, I think Freemasonry
has retained its ideals.

00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:40.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not politically
influential today,

00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:42.750 align:middle line:84%
but it is a charitable
and civic organization.

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And there are young
people in Freemasonry

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:48.099 align:middle line:84%
who are successfully reviving
the esoteric tradition.

00:50:48.099 --> 00:50:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
to watch because we're

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:52.230 align:middle line:84%
going to see that revival
in our generation.

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I think so.

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:54.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.870 align:middle line:84%
I have to say we have 10
or 15 minutes left to chat.

00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Do you know we're bout
15% through this book?

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:01.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.342 align:middle line:90%


00:51:01.342 --> 00:51:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I'll come
back as much as you like.

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:04.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm enjoying it.

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:04.440 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
have you back for part two.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.394 align:middle line:84%
But I've been thinking
part three, part four.

00:51:07.394 --> 00:51:10.770 align:middle line:84%
We'll just go on because
each aspect of the story

00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:12.990 align:middle line:84%
is just so delectable
that I don't really

00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:13.966 align:middle line:90%
want to leave them out.

00:51:13.966 --> 00:51:14.766 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:51:14.766 --> 00:51:15.566 align:middle line:90%
I hear you.

00:51:15.566 --> 00:51:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's go ahead and
talk about the "Poughkeepsie

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:18.920 align:middle line:90%
Seer."

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, one of
my favorite characters.

00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Now the Poughkeepsie
Seer was a young man

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.710 align:middle line:84%
named Andrew Jackson
Davis who grew up

00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:27.960 align:middle line:84%
in the industrial town
of Poughkeepsie, which

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.090 align:middle line:84%
was in New York's
Hudson Valley, just

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:31.800 align:middle line:84%
adjacent to the
Burned-over district.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.710 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, it's
the Eastern border

00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:37.140 align:middle line:90%
of the Burned-over district.

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Davis was the son of a local
ne'er-do-well sharecropper.

00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:46.530 align:middle line:84%
He was apprenticed
out to a cobbler.

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And, in the early
1840s, he began

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:53.280 align:middle line:84%
to experiment with
mesmerism or what we today

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.540 align:middle line:90%
would call hypnotism.

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:56.137 align:middle line:84%
It was an occult
healing philosophy--

00:51:56.137 --> 00:51:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of Europe.

00:51:56.970 --> 00:51:58.428 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --that
began in Europe,

00:51:58.428 --> 00:52:01.510 align:middle line:84%
crossed the Atlantic
to the Americas.

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And Davis found that he
could go into these very

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.360 align:middle line:84%
deep mesmeric trances
or what we today

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.430 align:middle line:90%
would call hypnotic trances.

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And he would experience
these astral travels

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:18.120 align:middle line:84%
and out-of-body experiences
while he was in trance states.

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And he said he would travel to
other planets, and dimensions,

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:22.774 align:middle line:90%
and visit with angels--

00:52:22.774 --> 00:52:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Heaven, all of it.

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.670 align:middle line:90%
--journey to the heavens.

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And he would come
back, and he would

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:32.040 align:middle line:84%
give these metaphysical
lectures and treatises

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.820 align:middle line:84%
based on what he had experienced
when he was in a trance state.

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And he began to
grow in popularity.

00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:42.450 align:middle line:84%
He moved to New
York City in 1845.

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And newspapers began
jokingly referring to him

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:48.840 align:middle line:84%
as the "Poughkeepsie Seer,"
but he embraced the nickname,

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.460 align:middle line:90%
and he would freely use it.

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And Davis, for a period of
time, was a very, very popular

00:52:54.010 --> 00:52:54.810 align:middle line:90%
figure.

00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:56.670 align:middle line:84%
He attracted the
interest of Edgar Allan

00:52:56.670 --> 00:53:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Poe, with whom he was, I believe
the word today is frenemies.

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:02.200 align:middle line:84%
They sort of
detested one another

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.320 align:middle line:84%
but also spent a lot
of time together.

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:08.100 align:middle line:84%
He also attracted the interest
of a Reverend George Bush

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:11.280 align:middle line:84%
who was an ancestor to the
Bush presidential family.

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And he was a big
defender of Davis.

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:16.590 align:middle line:84%
He died in 1859,
and he wrote a book

00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:19.410 align:middle line:84%
about mesmerism and
Andrew Jackson Davis,

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:23.010 align:middle line:84%
defending Davis as an
authentic spirit channeler.

00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:26.850 align:middle line:84%
The notable thing about Davis
who is not read much today

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and is not heard of
today is that he further

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:34.770 align:middle line:84%
imbued Americans with this idea
that any ordinary person could

00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:36.930 align:middle line:84%
pierce the veil to
the divine, could

00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:38.090 align:middle line:90%
play the part of prophet--

00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't
need an intermediary--

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: No intermediary.

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And that was very American,
and it tapped American ideals.

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:47.460 align:middle line:84%
The fact that Davis was
a cobbler's apprentice,

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:52.740 align:middle line:84%
was somebody who the newspapers
made fun of as a local yokel

00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:56.760 align:middle line:84%
from up the Hudson River, made
him endearing to Americans

00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.130 align:middle line:84%
because he was also playing
the part of prophet.

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And it said to Americans--
it tapped into a very deep

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:03.310 align:middle line:90%
American ideal--

00:54:03.310 --> 00:54:07.830 align:middle line:84%
which was that miracles,
prophecy, messages from God

00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:10.650 align:middle line:84%
weren't just restricted
to biblical antiquity,

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:14.010 align:middle line:84%
but we could re-encounter them,
in Poughkeepsie, New York.

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And he ended up
writing this tome,

00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:20.460 align:middle line:84%
"The Principles of Nature,"
800 pages from his just

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:21.870 align:middle line:90%
channeled works, right?

00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And It is torturously-long,
very difficult to get through.

00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:30.450 align:middle line:84%
But it was a very
popular book in its day

00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:34.380 align:middle line:84%
because people felt so excited
that this local kid could

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:38.940 align:middle line:84%
possibly be a kind of
receptor for divine energies.

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And other Americans
began to ask, why not me?

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.360 align:middle line:90%
Why not me?

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and one of
the people who witnessed him

00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and his work was-- he
was doing, apparently,

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.950 align:middle line:84%
a medical diagnosis at
the time, if I recall--

00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:51.600 align:middle line:90%
Henry Olcott Steel.

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:54.505 align:middle line:84%
And now we're getting into
just a really juicy story--

00:54:54.505 --> 00:54:56.255 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: This is
where it all happens--

00:54:56.255 --> 00:54:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --where he
and his relationship

00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:02.065 align:middle line:84%
with the wild
Russian woman begin.

00:55:02.065 --> 00:55:03.690 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about this
for a little bit.

00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:05.356 align:middle line:84%
We might have to pick
it up again later,

00:55:05.356 --> 00:55:09.310 align:middle line:84%
but let's talk about who Henry
Olcott Steel was at the time.

00:55:09.310 --> 00:55:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:15.570 align:middle line:84%
This really opens the door to
the modern alternative virtual

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:16.740 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Henry Steel Olcott was
a civil war Colonel

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:23.040 align:middle line:84%
who retired after
the war and thought

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:26.370 align:middle line:84%
he was going to spend
his life toiling away

00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:28.620 align:middle line:90%
in a legal practice.

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And, instead, he
developed an interest

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:33.210 align:middle line:84%
in what was then
called spiritualism

00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:35.010 align:middle line:90%
or talking to the dead.

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And this grew out of the
work of Andrew Jackson Davis,

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:38.960 align:middle line:90%
as you were alluding.

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He has witnessed
him doing a medical reading

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:40.680 align:middle line:90%
on someone.

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:43.055 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: He had witnessed
him doing a medical reading,

00:55:43.055 --> 00:55:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and Davis also
imported from Europe

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and reworked the term seance, or
sitting, and encouraged people

00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:53.700 align:middle line:84%
that if they wanted to
communicate with spirits

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:55.230 align:middle line:84%
from the hidden
world, they should

00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:56.790 align:middle line:90%
form into seance circles.

00:55:56.790 --> 00:55:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And he gave very
precise instructions

00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:00.160 align:middle line:90%
as to how this could be done.

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And also, again, in the
Burned-over district,

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.800 align:middle line:84%
there were two young women
named the Fox sisters who

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:06.510 align:middle line:84%
told their Methodist
parents that they

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:10.040 align:middle line:84%
were channeling spirits from
the hidden world and so forth.

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:14.720 align:middle line:84%
All this was unfolding in
the late 1840s, early 1850s.

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:18.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, historians used to
call the 1840s the mad 40s.

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:21.590 align:middle line:84%
We don't look back on it as
this particularly avant garde

00:56:21.590 --> 00:56:25.160 align:middle line:84%
era in American
life, but the 1840s

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.770 align:middle line:84%
was a period of time when
America was at peace,

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:31.190 align:middle line:84%
was prosperous, was expanding,
and people were experimenting.

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So you have this
movement of spiritualism

00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:35.750 align:middle line:84%
where people are claiming
to talk to the dead

00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:37.640 align:middle line:84%
and receive spirit
transmissions.

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Women are becoming
mediums, again,

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.940 align:middle line:84%
filling a religious void,
filling a religious role.

00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And Henry Steel Olcott who
was working as a lawyer,

00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:51.230 align:middle line:84%
as a journalist, as a
retired officer became very

00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:53.060 align:middle line:84%
interested in this,
began to write articles

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:54.350 align:middle line:90%
about this movement.

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And he, in the early
1870s, is up in Vermont

00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:00.980 align:middle line:90%
visiting a haunted farmhouse.

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And who does he
happen to meet but

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:07.550 align:middle line:84%
this mysterious world-traveled
Russian noble woman named

00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Madame H.P. Blavatsky
who tells him

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:13.520 align:middle line:84%
that she journeyed to
America because America

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.770 align:middle line:84%
is the cradle of
spiritualism and is

00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:18.200 align:middle line:84%
going to be the
birthplace of a revolution

00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:19.940 align:middle line:90%
in modern spirituality.

00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And the two get
together, and they start

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:24.230 align:middle line:90%
writing and experimenting.

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And they form a little society
first called The Miracle Club.

00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And then later, in
1875, they reform it

00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:34.640 align:middle line:84%
into a more formal group called
the Theosophical Society.

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And Madame Blavatsky, his
partner and his co-explorer,

00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:43.010 align:middle line:84%
taught that all religions derive
from this ancient occult belief

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:46.760 align:middle line:84%
system that we've lost sight
of, but that we can rediscover.

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the birth
of the alternative spiritual

00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:51.400 align:middle line:90%
revolution.

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot more to
say about Helena Blavatsky.

00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:58.310 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a really good
breaking point, which you just

00:57:58.310 --> 00:57:59.130 align:middle line:90%
said.

00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:01.880 align:middle line:10%
And so we're going to
pick it up with Blavatsky,

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:04.850 align:middle line:10%
their influence on society,
whatever happened to them,

00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:08.640 align:middle line:10%
and then the rest of the
next 75% of the book.

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.070 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: To be continued.

00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:12.230 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Mitch, it's
absolutely fascinating.

00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:13.490 align:middle line:10%
I enjoy every second of it.

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:14.930 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much.

00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:16.910 align:middle line:10%
We'd barely begun,
as we just stated,

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:19.560 align:middle line:10%
meaning we will be back with
Mitch for a fascinating second,

00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:21.050 align:middle line:10%
maybe even a third part.

00:58:21.050 --> 00:58:23.930 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
