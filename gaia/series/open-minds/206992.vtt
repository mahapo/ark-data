>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
I just asked THEO.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.023 align:middle line:90%
I said, what's next?

00:00:11.023 --> 00:00:12.777 align:middle line:84%
And they just said,
relationships.

00:00:12.777 --> 00:00:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: So do you
feel comfortable with going

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.260 align:middle line:90%
THEO now?

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: Absolutely.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.470 align:middle line:90%
It is the beginning, is it not?

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : It is.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: The new
paradigm of relationships

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.940 align:middle line:90%
is preferential, not needy.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.075 align:middle line:90%
And it's a dramatic change.

00:00:26.075 --> 00:00:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : It's as though
humanity is trying to burst off

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.790 align:middle line:84%
the chains of
restrictions of the past.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Most would
say they wish to be happy.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:84%
What they want is being
comfortable in their skin.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.980 align:middle line:90%
We speak of it as soul-centered.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.330 align:middle line:84%
You hold your boundaries,
and it's not with anger.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's
speaking the truth.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Truth is always accepted,
but it may not be liked.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a work in
progress, isn't it?

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: But what you're
going to find out is--

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.058 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : After more than
a year of stress and trauma,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.170 align:middle line:84%
the one area of life that may
be suffering more than any other

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.060 align:middle line:90%
are personal relationships.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Counselors are booked
up well in advance.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Divorce attorneys say, take
a ticket and stand in line,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:90%
as do the courts.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.210 align:middle line:10%
With this in mind, Sheila
and Marcus Gillette

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.580 align:middle line:10%
are here with us
today along with THEO

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.310 align:middle line:10%
to talk about
soulful relationships

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.243 align:middle line:10%
in a time of turmoil.

00:01:21.243 --> 00:01:22.160 align:middle line:10%
Because you know what?

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.640 align:middle line:10%
We like to say, OK, a lot of
that whole infectious thing has

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:10%
past humanity at the moment.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.770 align:middle line:90%
We're moving on.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.830 align:middle line:84%
But the repercussions
of that are not,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.130 align:middle line:90%
where our world is different.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.410 align:middle line:90%
It has changed.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Our levels of
stress have changed.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Our levels of understanding,
sometimes higher, sometimes

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.590 align:middle line:90%
lower, have changed.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.280 align:middle line:90%
Our relationships have changed.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:90%
So welcome.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.672 align:middle line:84%
It's good to see both of
your shiny faces once again.

00:01:47.672 --> 00:01:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Oh, it's good
to be with you again.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's great
to be here, Regina.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : So let's
talk about this now.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.090 align:middle line:84%
You were told a few
years ago about this.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.100 align:middle line:90%
And you thought, huh?

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And now it could not have
arrived at a more perfect time.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how
this book came about

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.320 align:middle line:90%
and what THEO told you all.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.183 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well,
Marcus, about--

00:02:07.183 --> 00:02:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's been
about three years.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --three years.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.477 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And I
just asked THEO.

00:02:11.477 --> 00:02:12.480 align:middle line:90%
I said, what's next?

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.230 align:middle line:10%
What do we need to
share of your teachings

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:10%
that can have the greatest
impact on humanity?

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.982 align:middle line:84%
And they just said,
relationships.

00:02:17.982 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Full stop, period.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.107 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Full stop.

00:02:20.107 --> 00:02:21.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no question.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : And you said, hmm--

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I said, hmm, it
seems a little mundane, right?

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Not feeling it.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: But
we really got it.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:84%
As we started to flesh it out
with them, we really got it.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.375 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : Once you
started digging in.

00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:32.380 align:middle line:84%
But at first, it's like,
OK, thought it might

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.090 align:middle line:90%
be sexier or something, right?

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:84%
But here it is, and
this is the one thing.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I see it
everywhere, more people

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.220 align:middle line:84%
choosing to live
alone now after this

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and just saying, I can't
deal with humanity anymore,

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.850 align:middle line:84%
relationships where people
are intimately involved really

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:90%
taking a hit.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.683 align:middle line:90%
Domestic violence is up.

00:02:51.683 --> 00:02:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, the
thing about living

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.010 align:middle line:84%
alone is you get to
be right all the time.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : That's right.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Right?

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : You do.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's
what we hear THEO say.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.736 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:58.736 --> 00:03:01.102 align:middle line:84%
You have nobody to
tell you you're wrong.

00:03:01.102 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : I get
to be wrong a lot.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.623 align:middle line:90%
Don't you guys?

00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a
relationship, of course

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.373 align:middle line:90%
you get to be wrong a lot.

00:03:06.373 --> 00:03:08.350 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: If
you're alone, there's

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.750 align:middle line:10%
no reflection back to
you of another opinion.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.550 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA : Right.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.170 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: And that's
how we grow the most.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.970 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA : Right.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: Really.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.170 align:middle line:10%
To have that reflection
of another opinion

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.910 align:middle line:10%
is so important to our
expansion and growth.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : It is.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we seem to
spend our lives trying

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.410 align:middle line:84%
to find relationships and
partners that serve as mirrors,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.360 align:middle line:84%
where we just get to
see more of each other

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.763 align:middle line:90%
but in a different set of eyes.

00:03:34.763 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Well, and also--

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:36.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:84%
--and also hoping that you'll
feel the woundedness in me,

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.200 align:middle line:84%
and I'll feel the
woundedness in you--

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Exactly.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.497 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --which
is the old paradigm.

00:03:42.497 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : And so when
THEO chimes in on this,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:90%
what do they say about that?

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: About that--

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : About the notion
we're just looking for mirrors

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.405 align:middle line:84%
because we don't want
to be confronted.

00:03:51.405 --> 00:03:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, that's the
old ways of relationship.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Because as Marcus said,
the woundedness in myself

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.970 align:middle line:84%
will attract the woundedness
in somebody else.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And if I take care of you,
you'll take care of me.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.500 align:middle line:90%
And that just never works out.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : No.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.680 align:middle line:84%
We still are thinking
that way, right?

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Mm-hmm.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : The movies are still
kind of sharing that story,

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:90%
and romance novels.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's not working
out too well right now.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's not, because
it's an inside-out job.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.079 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Right.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We have to take
care of those inner things

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.880 align:middle line:84%
in us, these patterns
of beliefs about us

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:90%
that are simply untrue.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.520 align:middle line:84%
The unlovability,
the unacceptability,

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:90%
the unworthiness--

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.180 align:middle line:84%
all those things are things that
have been developed over time

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.760 align:middle line:84%
that we've adopted
from our environment,

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.760 align:middle line:84%
from other people telling us
something about ourselves.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're saying, oh,
yeah, OK, that's true.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.870 align:middle line:84%
That, going in and
rewriting that script

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.490 align:middle line:90%
is what is necessary.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And loving the self is
the utmost relationship

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:90%
that we should have.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't do
that, we can't really

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:84%
attract that type
of love in our life,

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.775 align:middle line:84%
that unconditional loving
relationship that we all want.

00:05:10.775 --> 00:05:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : Because we haven't
created a resonance for it.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: No, no.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : It makes total sense.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Or the knowing
of that for ourselves

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.300 align:middle line:90%
as ourselves.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Exactly.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So what
their premise is,

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:84%
is that any thought
that we have that

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.920 align:middle line:84%
is anything other than
unconditionally loving thoughts

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and beliefs about the
self is simply untrue,

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.620 align:middle line:84%
and that we're becoming this
unconditional state of being

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle line:90%
of unconditional love.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.680 align:middle line:84%
The state of being
of unconditional

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.540 align:middle line:84%
love-- it's not a
feeling or an emotion.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a vibration.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's an actual
waking, walking way

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.070 align:middle line:90%
of being in the world.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Indeed.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.040 align:middle line:90%
But here's the problem.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.810 align:middle line:90%
We've got subconscious minds.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.720 align:middle line:84%
We have all these
aspects of mind.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.528 align:middle line:84%
And the one that
dogs us is the one

00:05:51.528 --> 00:05:53.320 align:middle line:84%
that is the collective
of everything that's

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.750 align:middle line:84%
ever been, and ever
happened, and every emotion

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.050 align:middle line:90%
we've ever experienced.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, from that
comes the reactivity,

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.260 align:middle line:84%
when you're face to
face with someone

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.850 align:middle line:84%
else who presents something
different or challenging.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And then you're feeling judged
and less than because it brings

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:90%
up those voices from the past.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I'm going to have
a conversation with THEO

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:84%
But from your boots on
the ground view of it,

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.360 align:middle line:84%
how do we begin
bypassing those--

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.200 align:middle line:90%
not bypassing.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.710 align:middle line:84%
How do we begin transforming
those reactions,

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.770 align:middle line:84%
that reactivity that
just pops up instantly?

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, THEO
developed a program

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.630 align:middle line:84%
that they've been teaching
for several decades now called

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Soul Integration,
and it's exactly what

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:90%
you're asking about.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.200 align:middle line:84%
It's getting in touch, as
they say, to the fragmented

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.770 align:middle line:84%
aspects of ourselves,
our souls, that

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
have developed those beliefs
or adopted them, created them

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.900 align:middle line:84%
in those moments or
events that happened,

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.810 align:middle line:84%
that they get frozen
in that period of time

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:90%
where the reactivity begins.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes a
repetitive experience

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.340 align:middle line:84%
because the triggers happen in
similar vibrational experiences

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.350 align:middle line:84%
to reaffirm those
beliefs over time.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.710 align:middle line:84%
So we have the patterns
keep repeating.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : We keep inviting
people in that keep triggering

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.250 align:middle line:90%
the exact same things--

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Exactly.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : --because it's still
looking to be acknowledged,

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.285 align:middle line:90%
to be healed, to be transformed.

00:07:18.285 --> 00:07:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Right.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's a
multidimensional process.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.830 align:middle line:84%
So the understanding of
the core circumstance--

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.907 align:middle line:90%
where did that belief occur?

00:07:24.907 --> 00:07:25.740 align:middle line:90%
When was it adopted?

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Right.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: What happened--

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Right.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --either
earlier in this lifetime

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.300 align:middle line:90%
or in another incarnation?

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Exactly.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Where the emotional
patterning carries over

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:90%
to this--

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : This
carries over, yeah.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And when
you have the awareness

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.380 align:middle line:84%
of the circumstance that created
the belief in the first place,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.630 align:middle line:84%
you can have that moment of
awareness, where you have,

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.100 align:middle line:84%
wait a minute, I get
it, I understand now.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.577 align:middle line:84%
So now you move from
reactivity to response

00:07:44.577 --> 00:07:46.410 align:middle line:84%
because you understand
the circumstance that

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:84%
created the belief that led
to the emotional reactivity.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It's awareness.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.312 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : It is awareness,
and that doesn't come easily.

00:07:53.312 --> 00:07:55.395 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, it's hard
for people to actually--

00:07:55.395 --> 00:07:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It's a process.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : --get a literal
understanding of what happened,

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:01.080 align:middle line:90%
or a picture, or a remembrance.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times,
that's not available.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.910 align:middle line:90%
Their mind isn't accepting that.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:09.542 align:middle line:84%
But this can come through
without knowing the exact date,

00:08:09.542 --> 00:08:10.500 align:middle line:90%
time, and circumstance.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It can.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yeah.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.627 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Or they'll know.

00:08:13.627 --> 00:08:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : Or they'll
suddenly see it.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And it's not
going into the rabbit

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.570 align:middle line:90%
hole of the emotions.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a revelation.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.750 align:middle line:90%
It's that "aha" moment.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Ah, now I know where it began.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.340 align:middle line:90%
And then you can reframe it.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.669 align:middle line:84%
THEO says, look at the
gifts and blessings

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:36.630 align:middle line:84%
of that experience that has made
you the person you are today,

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.620 align:middle line:84%
the strong, viable
person that you are.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Because in everything
that we go through,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.100 align:middle line:90%
there are gifts and blessings.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And the events don't
change, because that's history.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.070 align:middle line:84%
But how we perceive
it can change.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.130 align:middle line:84%
The lenses from which
we see the event

00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.570 align:middle line:84%
through can change with the
wisdom we've gotten today

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.190 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't have then.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Absolutely true.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things
THEO's been talking about

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.640 align:middle line:84%
is a new paradigm of
relationship coming in.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.370 align:middle line:84%
One thing humans beings
are generally so fond of

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.260 align:middle line:90%
is change at core levels.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:90%
We all do OK with that.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Everybody loves to say,
this is not working anymore,

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
to do it differently.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
take a little courage.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's going to take a
little sacrifice at times even.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So that part of
the story-- we're

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.760 align:middle line:90%
going to turn that over to THEO.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.672 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That's great.

00:09:31.672 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : Let's talk about
this new paradigm in romantic

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:38.340 align:middle line:84%
relationships and about what's
happening to us as a species

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.280 align:middle line:84%
that we're just wanting to
bust out from the chains

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.105 align:middle line:84%
of the restrictive past and all
of the challenges that brings.

00:09:45.105 --> 00:09:45.905 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:09:45.905 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, and that's
what this time is about.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : It is.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They talk about
this tremendous consciousness

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:84%
shift that's happening
now, and we've all

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:90%
volunteered to be here for it.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:90%
So it's a new adventure.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a new time.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a new place, and it's
all about changing our minds.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : It is.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're carrying
all the old with us.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : The old gets to meet
this new demand of us, really.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Mm-hmm.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.373 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : So do you feel
comfortable with going to THEO

00:10:14.373 --> 00:10:15.173 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:10:15.173 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Absolutely.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.600 align:middle line:90%
It is the beginning, is it not?

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : It is, THEO.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining us.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We are
appreciative of the opportunity

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:90%
to be of service unto you.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:90%
You may ask.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:84%
We have reserved the part
of the conversation that

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.790 align:middle line:84%
requires new thinking
and challenge

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.230 align:middle line:90%
to speak with you about.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
area where you talk

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:84%
about a new paradigm
of relationships

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.770 align:middle line:84%
that is attempting to be
born, that is being born

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.340 align:middle line:84%
into the world, especially
of intimate and romantic

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.810 align:middle line:90%
relationships.

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Can you just start by telling
us what this new paradigm is?

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: The new paradigm
of relationships now

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.460 align:middle line:90%
is preferential, not needy.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:84%
For, in the past,
in historical past,

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.760 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of
generational patterns

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:84%
that have been passed
along for centuries,

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:15.590 align:middle line:84%
there has been this greater
need to be together.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And that neediness has been
an external process, not

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:24.620 align:middle line:84%
an internal process,
to some degree for life

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.010 align:middle line:84%
itself and sustainability
and survival.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:34.970 align:middle line:84%
There's also, the other part
is the woundedness in one being

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:38.990 align:middle line:84%
attracting the woundedness
in another subconsciously

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.950 align:middle line:84%
in the belief or expectation,
if I take care of you,

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.380 align:middle line:84%
you will take care
of me emotionally.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:90%
And that does not work.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:54.840 align:middle line:84%
In actuality, it never has,
because each individual

00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:00.330 align:middle line:84%
must come into their own
wholeness, their own awareness

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.240 align:middle line:90%
of that love of self.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And in doing such,
attracting unto itself

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:11.600 align:middle line:84%
its likeness, which is
a preference, not need.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And so what is happening
now is a realization

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:22.270 align:middle line:84%
of how those patterns have been
passed along and changing them.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And they're held in belief
systems that have been,

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:33.860 align:middle line:84%
as we said, generationally
and societally passed along.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
is changing now,

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and it's a dramatic change
because individuals now

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.300 align:middle line:90%
are self-sustainable.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:48.030 align:middle line:84%
They can provide for
themselves everything.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And they need to provide
love for themselves

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.940 align:middle line:84%
as well to have that
in the external,

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.650 align:middle line:84%
in reality of a primary
relationship coming

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:02.820 align:middle line:84%
into the unconditional
loving vibration.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Thank you for that.

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And as you're saying
that, I'm looking

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.270 align:middle line:84%
at this, the other aspect of
that, because this is all new,

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.620 align:middle line:90%
and the clash of paradigms.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going
to get into some

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.570 align:middle line:84%
of what this will
entail that we'll

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:20.980 align:middle line:84%
need to mature along the way
to be able to accomplish.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.630 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that
pops up right away

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.590 align:middle line:84%
is, when we move into
preferential relationships

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.810 align:middle line:84%
rather than
relationships of need--

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and you just spoke about the
pitfalls of relationships

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.520 align:middle line:90%
of need for survival and all.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.420 align:middle line:84%
But one thing you had
to do is whether you

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.795 align:middle line:84%
liked it or not, you got to
have to learn to work it out,

00:13:37.795 --> 00:13:39.070 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:44.290 align:middle line:84%
In the area of preferential
relationships, you can say,

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to work
that out with you.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.160 align:middle line:84%
I just want to do
what I want to do.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.530 align:middle line:84%
I want to feel how
I want to feel.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Is there another part of
it could demotivate people

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:56.590 align:middle line:84%
from having the commitment
to working through something

00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.617 align:middle line:84%
if you really just-- you
don't need each other?

00:14:00.617 --> 00:14:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: But that's still
living in the old paradigm.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : Yes, it is,
[CHUCKLING] very much.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.095 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So
the new paradigm--

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:10.240 align:middle line:84%
there's a realization that
out of a preferential desire

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:15.200 align:middle line:84%
to be together, there's
a commonality of respect

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and that then there is a
desire within that respectful

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:23.210 align:middle line:84%
relationship to have a dialogue
communication on a deeper

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.600 align:middle line:90%
level in truth and authenticity.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:84%
There are no withholds,
and so you know each other

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.030 align:middle line:90%
at a greater depth.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And in this, one of the
things that's happening

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.860 align:middle line:84%
is, when it comes
to self-identity,

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.160 align:middle line:84%
even our own self-sexual
identity and relationships,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.050 align:middle line:84%
is it's as though
humanity is trying

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:50.340 align:middle line:84%
to burst off the chains of
restrictions of the past.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.697 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
this a little bit.

00:14:53.697 --> 00:14:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's what
we're talking about,

00:14:55.530 --> 00:15:01.240 align:middle line:84%
is generational and
societal experiences,

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.542 align:middle line:84%
relational experiences that
have been passed along.

00:15:04.542 --> 00:15:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : And they're in us.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're born with them.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : And that they're
reinculcated into us

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:11.110 align:middle line:90%
and the world around us.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.735 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: There
have been many things

00:15:12.735 --> 00:15:16.220 align:middle line:84%
spoken about the sins of the
fathers visited upon the sons.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: But it's the
sins of all humanity visited

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.330 align:middle line:90%
upon the future generations.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We do not
like the word "sins,"

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.250 align:middle line:84%
but we're just using
that as a metaphor,

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.560 align:middle line:84%
for that is what has
been passed along.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.350 align:middle line:90%
This is how you do it.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And as many know,
women are taught

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:42.270 align:middle line:84%
to be acting out in a certain
way to be desirable to men.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And men are there to
be powerful and to have

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:84%
the money and all the
things that are of import

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:55.500 align:middle line:90%
for life and survival.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's had
different iterations

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.850 align:middle line:84%
of that throughout
the centuries,

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:05.070 align:middle line:90%
of course, what that meant.

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:84%
But now each individual
has the ability

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.985 align:middle line:84%
to provide for themselves
in those specific needs.

00:16:11.985 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So in
the preferential need

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.430 align:middle line:84%
is a desire for heart
being fulfilled,

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:23.760 align:middle line:84%
that sense of camaraderie,
the sense of friendship,

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:84%
trust, all of the
things that are abiding

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:32.510 align:middle line:84%
in unconditional love,
which is ultimately

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:90%
respect for one another.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : Indeed, and this
comes to a word that is bandied

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.740 align:middle line:90%
about quite a lot.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And the word is
"sovereignty--" finding one's

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:48.450 align:middle line:84%
own autonomy and sovereignty
as a being and not

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.670 align:middle line:84%
what we call giving
one's power away.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is a really
big one, and I

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:57.210 align:middle line:84%
would like you to comment
on it in general and then

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:01.600 align:middle line:84%
through the feminine lens
because women often just open

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.400 align:middle line:90%
the field.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.567 align:middle line:84%
And their energy's flowing
to whoever else is there.

00:17:04.567 --> 00:17:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And doesn't matter
if it's a woman who

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:11.849 align:middle line:84%
has a beautiful career and can
totally take care of herself.

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:15.060 align:middle line:84%
A man enters the picture-- pff--
the energy offloads to the man.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.880 align:middle line:84%
What is it about
this flow of energy

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.900 align:middle line:84%
that's so difficult
to artfully bring back

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.079 align:middle line:90%
into our personal sovereignty?

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So that's what
we're talking about, knowing

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:29.660 align:middle line:90%
that you're worthy.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:34.250 align:middle line:84%
That's self-love, not from
conceit or narcissism,

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:38.720 align:middle line:84%
but in the truth of
honoring and loving the self

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:84%
and feeling comfortable
in your skin.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.100 align:middle line:84%
If you ask people,
what do you want,

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.410 align:middle line:84%
most would say they
wish to be happy.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, happiness is relative.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.092 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:17:48.092 --> 00:17:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: What
they want is being

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:50.840 align:middle line:90%
comfortable in their skin.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Feeling at peace, no matter what
is happening in their world,

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.930 align:middle line:90%
is a challenge for growth.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:84%
They're desiring just
to be centered in self.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.590 align:middle line:90%
We speak of it as soul-centered.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And in that soul-centered
place, one can speak the truth.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.390 align:middle line:84%
What you're talking about
is giving one's power away

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.940 align:middle line:84%
for acceptance
sake, and that has

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.430 align:middle line:84%
to do with survival
and abandonment.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : And this is a very,
very deep program and wound

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:23.460 align:middle line:84%
in females, people who have
dominantly been incarnating

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.720 align:middle line:90%
as feminine.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yes,
because, societally, it's

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.970 align:middle line:90%
been proven so.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Women had no power and relied
upon the man for survival.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : What about the other
notion in terms of energy flow

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.450 align:middle line:90%
and awareness of--

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.790 align:middle line:84%
forget the male part
of it, forget the man--

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
the woman in her own
family, her own children,

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.180 align:middle line:90%
the people around her?

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.750 align:middle line:84%
This, I'm asking from
this level as well,

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.110 align:middle line:84%
seems to be something
almost endemic to most women

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.940 align:middle line:84%
as their energy
is always flowing

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.520 align:middle line:90%
to whoever is in the room.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- it's
unconscious, and not

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:03.990 align:middle line:84%
necessarily for acceptance or
for love, but an unconscious

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:05.558 align:middle line:90%
thing that we tend to do.

00:19:05.558 --> 00:19:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: The nurturer.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's
the female energy.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And males have that
dominant, protective energy.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: But understand this.

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time to recognize
both those sides of self,

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.420 align:middle line:90%
the masculine and the feminine.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Each male and female
has that within them,

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.800 align:middle line:90%
and that should be celebrated.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : And yet, we still
need to move into this new

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.120 align:middle line:84%
paradigm of awareness
that either one can't keep

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.190 align:middle line:84%
perpetuating exclusively
the same thing anymore.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:46.500 align:middle line:84%
We do have to learn to
recognize this and consciously,

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.590 align:middle line:84%
would you say,
withhold-- not withhold,

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.982 align:middle line:84%
but maintain, hold our
own energy for ourself.

00:19:52.982 --> 00:19:53.940 align:middle line:90%
What would you call it?

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I know
personally I'm horrible.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.950 align:middle line:84%
My energy leaks out to whoever
is in any room anywhere.

00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:59.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I don't even--

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So what you do
that you hold your boundaries,

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.880 align:middle line:90%
and it's not with anger.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.110 align:middle line:84%
It's speaking the
truth, communication.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : How do you
hold your energy in?

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: For an
example, it's very simple.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.200 align:middle line:90%
We'll give you a simple example.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:23.540 align:middle line:84%
If someone would say to
you, let's go have a meal,

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.770 align:middle line:84%
and they suggest
Italian food, and you

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:32.740 align:middle line:84%
don't like Italian food,
however, you say, yes,

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.350 align:middle line:84%
I would love to do
this, because you

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.660 align:middle line:90%
don't want to hurt feelings.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.240 align:middle line:90%
You want to spend time together.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of
saying, that wouldn't

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.200 align:middle line:84%
be my first preference--
could we choose something

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.300 align:middle line:84%
that we both would
enjoy, because I would

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.580 align:middle line:90%
love to spend time with you?

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : What a
perfect solution.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] It's so simple.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:21:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: But so many
times, it becomes angry.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't like that.

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:04.690 align:middle line:90%
Why can't we do something else?

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:05.955 align:middle line:90%
You always choose the Italian.

00:21:05.955 --> 00:21:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : Or
passive aggressive,

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:11.050 align:middle line:84%
where you just feel drained
and say, OK, I'll do it.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And you don't enjoy
your experience.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And that's
what we're talking about.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.020 align:middle line:84%
It's much better to say,
that's not my first choice.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It can
be done kindly.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : And what you say
is applicable to all aspects

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.620 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.485 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : It's not just
about having a meal.

00:21:29.485 --> 00:21:31.810 align:middle line:84%
It's about how you're raising
your children together,

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.160 align:middle line:90%
various topics that come up.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:38.800 align:middle line:84%
It really sounds like
that is the perfect entree

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:84%
to respectfully go into
communion on points

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:42.790 align:middle line:90%
of difference.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And its
communication always,

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:49.370 align:middle line:90%
but it's truth.

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.100 align:middle line:90%
Truth is always accepted--

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.220 align:middle line:90%
always accepted.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.560 align:middle line:84%
It may not be liked
at the moment.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.300 align:middle line:84%
But if someone knows
they're told the truth,

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:90%
they'll accept it.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's a great
honoring within that.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:07.830 align:middle line:84%
For if one tells
the truth, you don't

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:middle line:84%
have to remember what
you say, because you

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.200 align:middle line:84%
would say the same thing
over and over again, yes?

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So there's no
agitation within that.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:20.522 align:middle line:90%
But it's also, trust is built.

00:22:20.522 --> 00:22:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : This is
definitely true.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.600 align:middle line:84%
I think there are moments
when people know empirical,

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.480 align:middle line:90%
historically embraced truths.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.420 align:middle line:84%
There are also times
when people are

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.610 align:middle line:90%
putting forth something they--

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:34.990 align:middle line:84%
calling it truth
when it's simply

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:39.180 align:middle line:84%
a belief, when it's not
maybe empirically true,

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.140 align:middle line:90%
and then get stuck.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, the truth of
the situation is this.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:43.890 align:middle line:90%
It's my truth.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And so how do you approach
the subject of truth?

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:54.100 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: Truth-- everyone
has a truth barometer in them.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:58.030 align:middle line:10%
You feel it viscerally,
physically in your body.

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:03.050 align:middle line:84%
When you speak the truth to
someone or it's spoken to you,

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:06.380 align:middle line:84%
pay attention to
that truth barometer.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Other things are just
opinions, aren't they?

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you hear truth, real
truth, time-honored truth,

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.130 align:middle line:90%
there is a peace.

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't like it,
there is a quietude and peace

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.273 align:middle line:90%
that accompanies it.

00:23:21.273 --> 00:23:22.815 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yes,
because you feel it.

00:23:22.815 --> 00:23:23.615 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:23:23.615 --> 00:23:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And that peace
you feel is the trust.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You can
trust who spoke to you.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Thank you for that.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:35.390 align:middle line:84%
I think that's critical for
us to understand that feeling

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:37.730 align:middle line:90%
again because much of society--

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.700 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about this
before-- has become disconnected

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.120 align:middle line:90%
with any empirical truth.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.550 align:middle line:90%
It's all opinions out there--

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.823 align:middle line:84%
opinions, opinions
swirling everywhere.

00:23:45.823 --> 00:23:47.240 align:middle line:84%
You can't go
anywhere and get away

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.210 align:middle line:84%
from opinions and
points of view.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And to recognize that
stillness of truth--

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.340 align:middle line:84%
I thank you-- is
absolutely critical.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Most opinions aren't
the truth of the individual

00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:59.600 align:middle line:90%
speaking them either.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yeah, indeed, indeed.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.600 align:middle line:90%
So here I have this phrase.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.250 align:middle line:90%
It's called "soulfully aligned."

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.890 align:middle line:84%
You have to be soulfully
aligned in order

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:14.813 align:middle line:84%
to have a spiritual experience
or spiritual experiences,

00:24:14.813 --> 00:24:16.730 align:middle line:84%
which is really kind of
critical before you're

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.260 align:middle line:84%
going to join with
another person

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.140 align:middle line:84%
in an intimate
personal relationship.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.403 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that a bit?

00:24:22.403 --> 00:24:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's a work
in progress, isn't it?

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE:
Everything's spiritual.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:32.480 align:middle line:84%
You don't leave your soul in
the closet when you go to work

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.000 align:middle line:90%
or you go out and about.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Everything you do is
spiritual because you're

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.950 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual being in
a human experience.

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.500 align:middle line:84%
You're a soul having
a human experience.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.820 align:middle line:90%
Your soul is eternal.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And so everything that
is being experienced

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.930 align:middle line:84%
has a spiritual bend to
it because it's soulfully

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.935 align:middle line:84%
aligned to what the soul
desires to learn from.

00:24:57.935 --> 00:24:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So whether you're
aware of your soul's desire

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:11.020 align:middle line:84%
or not, it's still
a motivational part

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:16.920 align:middle line:84%
of the energy of the vibration
of you doing what you do.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : And taking the time
to be quiet enough to hear that

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.960 align:middle line:84%
soul voice, to listen, to feel
when it's whispering to us

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.720 align:middle line:84%
or screaming at us
is really important.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And life is moving
around us so fast

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.070 align:middle line:84%
that oftentimes, most of
the time, people don't stop

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.030 align:middle line:84%
and actually listen to
that that's speaking.

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's why
you had a global pause.

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:39.330 align:middle line:84%
The world needed to be
on pause, didn't it?

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: To recognize
that you're a global species.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.220 align:middle line:84%
You're all interconnected,
matters not the color

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.710 align:middle line:84%
of your skin, the
language that you speak,

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.310 align:middle line:90%
the place that you live.

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:55.840 align:middle line:84%
You are one species
on this planet.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And the changes
that are coming now

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.850 align:middle line:84%
are of great import
for the entire species

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.590 align:middle line:90%
and all other species.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : Would you
care to elaborate?

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: These
consciousness shifts--

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Oh, I see--

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --that
are happening--

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --and
structures from this planet.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.260 align:middle line:84%
New businesses, new innovations
are coming forth out

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.370 align:middle line:90%
of this pause.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : And old
models are crumbling.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Necessarily so.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes, indeed.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: They work anymore.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : They don't work.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And
so it's evolving,

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.130 align:middle line:84%
and we've been speaking about
this for several decades.

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes, you have been.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And
now it's at hand.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : It is.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And now we go from our
intimate relationships

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.920 align:middle line:84%
with something
else you talk about

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and are in the teachings that
you've shared through Sheila

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and Marcus with
others, and that has

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:50.340 align:middle line:84%
to do with having a better
understanding of our soul

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.580 align:middle line:84%
contracts with each
other and with family.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Of course, most of us have no
idea we have a soul contract.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.760 align:middle line:84%
We're like, what, that
hurts my feelings.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.400 align:middle line:84%
We react to each other
without understanding

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.010 align:middle line:90%
we have these soul contracts.

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:07.410 align:middle line:84%
So talk about soul
contracts to us,

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:11.160 align:middle line:84%
where they're made, in which
dimension they're made,

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.460 align:middle line:84%
how they come through, how
we can start recognizing them

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.090 align:middle line:84%
when they're available to
us, and working with them.

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So soul contracts
happen soul to soul,

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.310 align:middle line:90%
as you would imagine.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.810 align:middle line:90%
Souls are eternal.

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Groups incarnate together to
support each other's growth,

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:32.120 align:middle line:90%
and so that's a contract.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:36.260 align:middle line:84%
I'll go if you go,
typically, yes?

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And you're
supporting each other,

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:40.660 align:middle line:90%
and that grows.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And you meet each
other along the path--

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : In the human flesh.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --in the human body.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, think in terms of how many
people you meet in a lifetime.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Tens of thousands.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.310 align:middle line:90%
You pass them on the street.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:58.940 align:middle line:84%
You're in a vehicle,
an airplane, a train,

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:02.920 align:middle line:84%
an automobile, the marketplace,
wherever it might be.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.630 align:middle line:90%
You pass people.

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:05.560 align:middle line:90%
You interact.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.640 align:middle line:90%
You see them.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:10.340 align:middle line:84%
How many people are
you truly attracted to

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.410 align:middle line:90%
in those thousands of people?

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Very narrow band.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.710 align:middle line:84%
You can be assured
those you notice,

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:23.090 align:middle line:84%
those you interact with,
whether positive or negative,

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:26.640 align:middle line:90%
you've known before.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : So let's talk about
how it comes into our everyday

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:84%
function and
awareness in a family.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:37.440 align:middle line:84%
You're choosing-- it seems
to me that oftentimes when

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.950 align:middle line:84%
a soul is incarnating, we think,
oh, they came to these parents.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:44.130 align:middle line:84%
But often, in my
observation, we often

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:45.390 align:middle line:90%
will come through more for--

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.210 align:middle line:84%
through or for connection
more so to one parent

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.820 align:middle line:90%
than the other.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And so with your siblings,
for example, perhaps

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.450 align:middle line:84%
you came in with a soul
contract that's more in relation

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:58.890 align:middle line:90%
to past life with Father.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.590 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps your siblings
come in with past life

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:03.870 align:middle line:84%
with Mother, two totally
different dynamics,

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:05.680 align:middle line:90%
sets of lessons, and so forth.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So talk about this a
little bit and how we work

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.540 align:middle line:90%
with this in family dynamics.

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That's true.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.200 align:middle line:84%
How many times have
you heard someone

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.130 align:middle line:84%
say, I don't know how
I got in this family?

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Right.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Right?

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : Or I don't relate
to that one at all, my mother,

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.860 align:middle line:90%
or father, or my sister.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes, yes.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And that is true
by what you said.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.810 align:middle line:84%
The vibrational
frequency and dynamic--

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.480 align:middle line:84%
a soul chooses the
father, the mother.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.460 align:middle line:90%
They may choose them both.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.660 align:middle line:84%
It's all
individualistic, you see.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: But maybe
none of the siblings,

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.790 align:middle line:90%
or maybe all of them--

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:43.290 align:middle line:84%
maybe the entire nuclear
family in that grouping

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:46.830 align:middle line:84%
is soul family and
soulfully connected.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:47.910 align:middle line:90%
That does happen.

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:50.250 align:middle line:90%
But most often, it doesn't.

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : What does
it normally look like?

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.490 align:middle line:90%
Take your average family.

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We would
say that it's possible

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:00.840 align:middle line:84%
that both parents were involved,
but one's more prominent

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.260 align:middle line:84%
energetically for the
learning than the other.

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:09.240 align:middle line:84%
But the siblings could be
either connected or not

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:13.400 align:middle line:84%
because they're more connected
to their choice of the parents,

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.290 align:middle line:90%
whichever one it is.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Right.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So how you
can tell is ask yourself,

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:22.100 align:middle line:84%
if I met this person
on the street,

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.830 align:middle line:84%
if we were not
genetically connected,

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.302 align:middle line:90%
would I even know them?

00:30:26.302 --> 00:30:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Notice them.

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:27.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Notice them--

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yeah.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --have
conversation with them.

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:34.690 align:middle line:90%
Or would you even cross paths?

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : That's
very good points.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:38.578 align:middle line:84%
So now, we look
around our family.

00:30:38.578 --> 00:30:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Say there are three
or four siblings.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:44.210 align:middle line:84%
You say, I feel a strong
connection to my mother,

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:45.010 align:middle line:90%
my brother.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't get who these
other people are.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't really feel
much for them at all.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean you
really spend your time--

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.300 align:middle line:84%
would you say as
a practical matter

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:59.260 align:middle line:84%
that you really focus on the
relationships of those maybe

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:02.830 align:middle line:84%
you've had relationships
with to further balance it?

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Or out of curiosity,
do you reach out

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and try exploring something
totally new with souls

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.100 align:middle line:84%
you've never met
before vis-a-vis

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.110 align:middle line:90%
the other siblings or parent?

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Not really.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : It seems to me it's
more efficient to deal with

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:15.980 align:middle line:90%
the ones you came for.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It is.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yeah.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Nor do they
want to deal with you.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Exactly.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.395 align:middle line:84%
This is a good
practical conversation.

00:31:22.395 --> 00:31:23.195 align:middle line:90%
I love it, THEO.

00:31:23.195 --> 00:31:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So what it is
that you can care for them.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:31.290 align:middle line:84%
You do have this interaction
together in a family unit,

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:35.130 align:middle line:84%
but not to be obsessed if
one doesn't speak to you,

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:38.160 align:middle line:84%
or something isn't right,
or you don't agree,

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:42.670 align:middle line:84%
because it's possible you will
never agree because you're not

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:43.792 align:middle line:90%
on the same wavelength.

00:31:43.792 --> 00:31:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : That's true.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And so how does this impact
a family when the child comes

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:51.640 align:middle line:84%
through the parent, and
the parent's like, oh, god,

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.010 align:middle line:84%
I know you, I feel
such a bond with you.

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:57.370 align:middle line:84%
The next one comes through,
and it's like, who are you?

00:31:57.370 --> 00:32:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Because this comes out
looking like favoritism,

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.540 align:middle line:84%
comes out looking like a
lot of different things.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.680 align:middle line:84%
So explain this in the
most gracious, healing

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.910 align:middle line:90%
possible sense.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's been part
of this whole series about

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:17.340 align:middle line:84%
beliefs, about self, being
lovable, and where it begins--

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes.

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --and how one
can address the love of self

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:26.130 align:middle line:84%
when they've not had that
expectation given them

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:29.790 align:middle line:84%
from a mother or a
father or either one.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : So you're saying it's
very important to understand

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:33.210 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Depersonalize that you may
have never known this person.

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:37.950 align:middle line:90%
There may not be a connection.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:39.313 align:middle line:90%
Don't take it personally.

00:32:39.313 --> 00:32:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's easy
to say, difficult to do.

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : Very easy
to say, exactly.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Because
most relationships,

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.820 align:middle line:84%
primary relationships
in adults are still

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:54.700 align:middle line:84%
acting out the expectations
unmet as a child.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is a perplexing
issue on Earth.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: But it's changing.

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:02.772 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : Tell us
how it's changing.

00:33:02.772 --> 00:33:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: As beings are
realizing how to love the self,

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:11.430 align:middle line:84%
how to truly love that
soul, recognize who it is,

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:15.030 align:middle line:90%
rewrite the script of the past.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.340 align:middle line:84%
The beliefs-- beliefs
can be changed.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Events won't be.

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And the beliefs in looking for
the blessings and the gifts

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:27.630 align:middle line:84%
of those experiences and even
those expectations that have

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:31.450 align:middle line:84%
brought you to the point
of this understanding--

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:35.650 align:middle line:84%
that can change and
bring in that solid state

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:39.240 align:middle line:90%
of unconditional love of self.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : This obviously
makes perfect sense.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Because once you do
learn this and you

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.610 align:middle line:84%
do master this sense
of self-respect,

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:53.680 align:middle line:84%
self-love, self-care,
this goes forward with you

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.677 align:middle line:90%
into other incarnations as well.

00:33:55.677 --> 00:33:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It will.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:59.093 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : And so then, when you
incarnate into a family where

00:33:59.093 --> 00:34:01.540 align:middle line:84%
maybe only one parent
acknowledges you, or knows you,

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:05.000 align:middle line:84%
or cares about you, you
already have this intact.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.860 align:middle line:84%
So you can help have a
more healthy experience

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.050 align:middle line:84%
for your own growth and
what you can contribute

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:12.503 align:middle line:90%
to the others in the family.

00:34:12.503 --> 00:34:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's a
consciousness shift

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:15.219 align:middle line:90%
we've been speaking about.

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Critical.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : Can you imagine
if everyone had-- well,

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:20.949 align:middle line:90%
of course you can.

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:22.100 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're
talking about it.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:22.600 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.969 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine if everybody
was soul integrated,

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:27.963 align:middle line:90%
and that's what this is about?

00:34:27.963 --> 00:34:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Absolutely.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.949 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You would
have peace on your planet.

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:32.241 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : We would have peace.

00:34:32.241 --> 00:34:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Peace within
and peace without.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : OK, yes, indeed.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And I really appreciate this
part of our conversation

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.400 align:middle line:84%
is so practical, so
practically important for us

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and clears up confusion about,
my mother didn't love me,

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:48.110 align:middle line:90%
or my father didn't love me.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's less
personal than that.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:51.199 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's good.

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:53.060 align:middle line:90%
Can be personal.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Can have brought some of
these karmic patterns forward.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.650 align:middle line:84%
But it can also be
totally non-personal.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
clearing that up for us.

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go
into the big one

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.220 align:middle line:84%
as human beings, the
one that has probably

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.720 align:middle line:84%
caused more trauma with
relationships than anything

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and all of its layers
subtle to in the face.

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And that is a subject
of betrayal, dishonesty

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:20.890 align:middle line:84%
and betrayal between each
other, especially on really

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:22.360 align:middle line:90%
intimate levels.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Please talk about
what this does.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Goes back
to communication.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Goes back to the
integration process.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Because when betrayal
happens, it's

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:34.503 align:middle line:84%
not about the other
person, actually.

00:35:34.503 --> 00:35:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes, that's true.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.212 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's
about the individual

00:35:37.212 --> 00:35:39.810 align:middle line:90%
that is the betrayer.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:43.020 align:middle line:84%
But everyone, throughout
different incarnations,

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:47.060 align:middle line:84%
has been either the
betrayed or the betrayer.

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And what is happening now
is the realization of that.

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And it all stems from
that lack of self-love,

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:59.800 align:middle line:84%
seeking love externally
rather than internally.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And when one feels betrayed,
it's not just outside the self.

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:13.850 align:middle line:84%
There has been a dynamic that
is drawn that into one's life--

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --for a
reason, for growth,

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:25.030 align:middle line:84%
for an understanding of who
has a belief on unlovability,

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:29.910 align:middle line:84%
because it's truly not about
the other person at all.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : That is true.

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And so perhaps the
most challenging part

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:38.170 align:middle line:84%
is when that happens,
it's a continuance

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:41.350 align:middle line:84%
of a lesson, where one has
already felt left behind,

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:43.390 align:middle line:84%
unloved, or betrayed
elsewhere that

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:44.770 align:middle line:90%
has yet to be met and healed.

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's a
repeated pattern.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : It's a
repeated pattern,

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:48.430 align:middle line:90%
and that's good to know.

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And as the betrayer,
that's it for the betrayed.

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And the one who is doing the
betrayal-- their continued

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.223 align:middle line:90%
lesson has its own corollary.

00:36:57.223 --> 00:36:58.390 align:middle line:90%
And please speak about that.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's a
betrayal as well.

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: They both are.

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Being betrayed and betraying
someone has the same energy

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:15.490 align:middle line:84%
to each individual because the
one who's betraying another

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:21.750 align:middle line:84%
is betraying themselves as well,
their truth, their honesty,

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:27.510 align:middle line:90%
their authenticity.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes, absolutely.

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Their truth--

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : That
piece isn't there.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: No.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And so what do
they get for that?

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:37.795 align:middle line:90%
A feeling of not being worthy.

00:37:37.795 --> 00:37:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:39.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes?

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:43.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:47.440 align:middle line:84%
I want to-- before we come
back to Sheila and Marcus,

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.200 align:middle line:84%
a couple more things I'd like
to talk to you about if you'll

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.520 align:middle line:84%
stay with us-- and that is the
notion of reframing our birth

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.050 align:middle line:90%
family history.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.810 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean
by reframing it?

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And what role does this
play in the context of what

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:05.020 align:middle line:90%
we've just been talking about?

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: The reframing
is the beliefs about it

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:11.970 align:middle line:84%
or about yourself within
that structure, as we've

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.560 align:middle line:84%
been speaking about
the father didn't love

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.640 align:middle line:84%
or the mother didn't
love, those expectations

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:21.600 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional
love being unmet.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And so what is recognized
now is that has

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:30.360 align:middle line:84%
to come from the inside of you,
that love of self, honoring

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:35.700 align:middle line:84%
of self, knowing that you are
a worthy, divine, magnificent

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.890 align:middle line:84%
being that is chosen
this human existence.

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's not from conceit,
arrogance, or narcissism.

00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:45.320 align:middle line:90%
It's from soul-centeredness.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And in that, there's humility,
a feeling of peace within.

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
this is all about.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : Then one loses the
need to have to constantly

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:00.800 align:middle line:84%
prove themselves to
and against the world.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.430 align:middle line:90%
What are they trying to prove?

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:06.930 align:middle line:90%
Their worthiness.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:12.352 align:middle line:84%
If one feels worthy, it
doesn't have to be proven.

00:39:12.352 --> 00:39:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : And once
nothing needs to be proven,

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:18.340 align:middle line:84%
look what happens to the
world's institutions.

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:23.070 align:middle line:84%
But the expansion
that can come--

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes.

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --and
the collaboration.

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : The creativity.

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : And so I'm going to
talk to Sheila and Marcus about

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.080 align:middle line:84%
the notion of when
the time has come,

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.050 align:middle line:84%
as has happened right now
at this period of time,

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:44.430 align:middle line:84%
with the Great Awakening,
the great isolation,

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:48.210 align:middle line:84%
where it comes time for
people to acknowledge that

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:50.020 align:middle line:84%
their relationship has
served its purpose.

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.210 align:middle line:84%
I will talk to them
about that in a minute.

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:56.160 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to ask you
before you and I conclude

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.830 align:middle line:84%
this part of the conversation,
is there anything else?

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:01.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know there
are years worth.

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:02.790 align:middle line:84%
But is there any
other single point

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:06.950 align:middle line:84%
that you think is critical to
share with us at this time?

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So what
you're going to find out

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:14.040 align:middle line:84%
is as this evolves in
each and every one of you,

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.540 align:middle line:90%
there's harmony.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's a realization
of the beauty and uniqueness

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:26.365 align:middle line:84%
of every single one of you
and in honoring of that.

00:40:26.365 --> 00:40:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : That
is the new world.

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:31.280 align:middle line:84%
That is utopia, just
that in and of itself.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.812 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:40:32.812 --> 00:40:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : For that, I
thank you so much, THEO.

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:36.400 align:middle line:84%
This has been a
wonderful conversation.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.400 align:middle line:84%
It's so good to be
with you once again.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We are
appreciative of the opportunity

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:41.993 align:middle line:90%
to serve you.

00:40:41.993 --> 00:40:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : And I have to
say thank you again for all

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.200 align:middle line:84%
the other things you've told us
in the past because they have

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.130 align:middle line:90%
come to pass.

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:49.260 align:middle line:84%
This period of time
in and of itself

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.100 align:middle line:84%
you've been speaking
about for decades.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, we're
center stage now.

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:54.970 align:middle line:90%
And we need your help.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:57.395 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And it is
given in the asking.

00:40:57.395 --> 00:40:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Thank you.

00:40:58.270 --> 00:40:59.965 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: God's love unto you.

00:40:59.965 --> 00:41:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Thank you, THEO.

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:01.965 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Good day.

00:41:01.965 --> 00:41:06.040 align:middle line:90%


00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Hello.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.975 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:07.975 --> 00:41:08.775 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:41:08.775 --> 00:41:09.733 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: She's back.

00:41:09.733 --> 00:41:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : --that had a lot
loaded into it that is very

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:17.700 align:middle line:84%
useful by way of reframing our
understanding of who we are,

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.300 align:middle line:84%
what we were birthed into, what
that might have actually been

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:24.030 align:middle line:84%
versus what we started
believing it to be.

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And right down through
the notion of betrayal--

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:30.450 align:middle line:84%
very, very powerful
useful information.

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And now before we say goodbye,
let's talk about what THEO says

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.450 align:middle line:90%
and how you help guide people.

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:39.390 align:middle line:84%
We've come to the time
where many people are now

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:42.610 align:middle line:84%
pulling away from one another
and ending relationships.

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's a way to do this
that has grace and respect.

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:47.880 align:middle line:84%
What is the word
you use for it here?

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.680 align:middle line:90%
It is, ah, honorable separation.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Mm-hmm.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : So let's talk
about honorable separation.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, you know, the
old way of ending relationship

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:03.058 align:middle line:84%
has been, you have to get
angry and blame each other.

00:42:03.058 --> 00:42:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : Get your
lawyers on board.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And mostly, you have to
rev up a reason to leave.

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And it
feels more comfortable

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and like you're not being the
bad guy if you're the one that

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:20.880 align:middle line:90%
is saying it's time.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.620 align:middle line:90%
If you can--

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : Trump up something
or create a reason--

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --create a blame.

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : A blame, yeah.

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Because
of this, I have to go.

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe it's just you've
completed this contract

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:39.480 align:middle line:84%
that you've had with
the other, and you've

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.700 align:middle line:90%
given blessings to each other.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.130 align:middle line:90%
You've learned together.

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the expectations that
we brought into relationship

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:53.190 align:middle line:84%
weren't met in this relationship
the way we wanted them,

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:55.530 align:middle line:90%
but many other things have been.

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:58.410 align:middle line:90%
But there's always been love.

00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So as THEO is teaching us
is just remember the love.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you can separate
honorably without anger,

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:12.000 align:middle line:84%
and blame, and making
the other person wrong.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.140 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to do.

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a
new way of thinking.

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : It is.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: But it can be done.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes, it can.

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's just like
telling the truth again.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:29.690 align:middle line:84%
It's just, we've come
together for this time.

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And now we have this
other growth to do.

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.520 align:middle line:90%
And these are the blessings.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.170 align:middle line:84%
If you can remember the
blessings, you can do it.

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes.

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you can go
away from it and what

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:41.330 align:middle line:84%
actually persists is the
love and the blessings,

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:43.250 align:middle line:90%
you know you've done it--

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.532 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : --instead of the
anger, and hurt, and blame.

00:43:46.532 --> 00:43:48.560 align:middle line:84%
If you're having that
months and years later,

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.750 align:middle line:84%
you know it's like, you
might want to revisit that.

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Or it's
going to carry right

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:52.790 align:middle line:90%
into the next relationship.

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:53.780 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA : Yeah,
will carry right in.

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:54.860 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: That same
energy is going to go right

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:55.902 align:middle line:10%
in the next relationship.

00:43:55.902 --> 00:44:00.980 align:middle line:10%
We're seeing people aspiring
now to amazing relationships

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.560 align:middle line:10%
instead of just, OK.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.310 align:middle line:84%
On the other side of
that coin is just OK.

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:04.710 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yeah.

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:06.783 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: You can tolerate it.

00:44:06.783 --> 00:44:08.000 align:middle line:90%
It's good, sometimes, maybe.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : This is where a huge
percentage of humanity lives.

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:10.700 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: But
what is tolerance?

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Right.

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You
know, it's endurance.

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.340 align:middle line:90%
It's energy.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:13.760 align:middle line:90%
It's ugh.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Right.

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Instead of being
just full-hearted, and joyous--

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yes.

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:20.872 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --and having--
we share in the book

00:44:20.872 --> 00:44:22.580 align:middle line:84%
several stories that
we've had, and we've

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:25.925 align:middle line:84%
shared with you
privately about miracles

00:44:25.925 --> 00:44:27.800 align:middle line:84%
and multidimensional
experiences that couples

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.690 align:middle line:84%
can have together with
intention and belief, right?

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yeah.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So it's
just a different way

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:33.290 align:middle line:84%
of being in relationship
with each other,

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and not to let whatever it was
that we left that relationship

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:40.500 align:middle line:84%
come in and taint and stain
the next relationship,

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.300 align:middle line:90%
because it will.

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:45.310 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: You know, Marcus,
that word that you said,

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:46.270 align:middle line:10%
endurance--

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:47.195 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA : Yes.

00:44:47.195 --> 00:44:48.820 align:middle line:84%
It's an endurance
race for most people.

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It's endurance--

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yeah.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --instead
of a choice.

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I want
to credit Michael.

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:54.040 align:middle line:84%
We were having dinner
with Michael Fishman.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.360 align:middle line:10%
I want to credit Michael for--

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.060 align:middle line:10%
we were talking about
tolerance, a friend of ours.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.310 align:middle line:10%
And he said, underneath
tolerance is endurance.

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Yeah.

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And
endurance has this energy

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.790 align:middle line:90%
of, ugh, effort and work.

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Ugh.

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And we don't want
to work on our relationship.

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:08.605 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : And restriction.

00:45:08.605 --> 00:45:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And
restriction, right?

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : So once we
come to this point,

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:15.670 align:middle line:84%
when that happens in our lives,
where we need to say goodbye,

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:17.950 align:middle line:84%
that is the most salient
advice that can be given.

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Instead of looking
for blame, looking

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:23.240 align:middle line:84%
to honor the love and the
good that came from it.

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And recognize, this is
the contract complete.

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:27.870 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Mm-hmm.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA : Thank you
so much, both of you,

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.050 align:middle line:90%
for being here again.

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And it couldn't have come at
a better time than right now.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.750 align:middle line:90%
So I'm glad the book's here now.

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:38.518 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I really appreciate it.

00:45:38.518 --> 00:45:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Oh,
thanks for having us.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Great to be here.

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Good to see you.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we'll be
back together again probably

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:44.600 align:middle line:90%
next year.

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We'll
look forward to it.

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I hope so.

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Very good.

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:47.588 align:middle line:90%
Thank you both so much.

00:45:47.588 --> 00:45:49.170 align:middle line:90%
