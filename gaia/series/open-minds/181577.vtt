00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.570 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Barbara Hand Clow

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.720 align:middle line:10%
is one of the most highly
respected researchers

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.350 align:middle line:10%
and writers in the field of
cosmology and consciousness.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.900 align:middle line:10%
Her famed books, "The
Pleiadian Agenda,"

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.200 align:middle line:10%
"Alchemy of Nine Dimensions,"
and "Mind Chronicle Trilogy"

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.600 align:middle line:10%
gave humanity a new way
to view our connection

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.790 align:middle line:10%
with unseen dimensions
and entities

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.530 align:middle line:10%
from other realms and planets.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to look
at the bigger picture of how

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.920 align:middle line:90%
all of this ties together.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And the promise that a true
disclosure holds for humanity.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:90%
Barbara, welcome.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And you did the
astrology on it, right?

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And you said this day
at this point in time

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.870 align:middle line:84%
is the most perfect time to
have a really deep discussion

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.190 align:middle line:84%
about disclosure, which you,
Steven Greer, and others feel

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.980 align:middle line:90%
is actually now approaching.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Because many of us have
thought, yada, yada,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.800 align:middle line:84%
was it Steven's original
disclosure, which was amazing,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.860 align:middle line:90%
amazing.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And then other events have
taken place over the years.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.140 align:middle line:90%
But nothing comes of it.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:90%
Nothing comes of it.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.330 align:middle line:84%
But you're feeling-- and
there's something cosmologically

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.000 align:middle line:84%
showing you-- that there
is something on the rise.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And so before we get to
that part of the story,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.950 align:middle line:84%
let's get back into
your own connection

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.780 align:middle line:84%
with beings from
other dimensions

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and when you first started
channeling the Pleiadians OK?

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.972 align:middle line:90%
So this is what, 1995.

00:01:38.972 --> 00:01:41.180 align:middle line:84%
That's when you first
channeled the body of work that

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.490 align:middle line:90%
became The Pleiadian Agenda.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.910 align:middle line:84%
What was the backdrop of your
life like at that time that

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.980 align:middle line:90%
allowed this to even happen?

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BARBARA HAND CLOW: I
don't think there was.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.130 align:middle line:10%
I was working for Bear &
Company publishing and raising

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:10%
four children and living my life
and writing a book every two

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.940 align:middle line:10%
years.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And I got hit by
a bomb of energy.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.457 align:middle line:84%
And I had no choice but to
receive it and to take it in

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:84%
and to channel it the only
way that I could bring it in.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.060 align:middle line:84%
It was so intense, it was
obviously very scientific

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.535 align:middle line:90%
and very multi-dimensional.

00:02:12.535 --> 00:02:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And so the only way
I could bring it in

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:84%
was to channel it,
whereas normally,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.380 align:middle line:84%
I work very much like
a left brain researcher

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.860 align:middle line:84%
or research a topic
and write about it.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I
mean, did you-- were

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.450 align:middle line:90%
you open and intuitive anyway?

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Was that just one
of your capacities

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.526 align:middle line:90%
that was there normally?

00:02:29.526 --> 00:02:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And plus, you have a
great brain for science.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.024 align:middle line:84%
So you were just a likely
candidate for this.

00:02:34.024 --> 00:02:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Plus, you're in the
publishing industry.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.064 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was it
just that you were

00:02:37.064 --> 00:02:38.949 align:middle line:84%
sort of the perfect
entity in a sense?

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, the interesting
thing about that, Regina,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.790 align:middle line:84%
is that I also was
working as a publisher.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And the year after
I brought the book

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.190 align:middle line:84%
in while it was an
editorial, I received

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.370 align:middle line:84%
four very serious queries
for the same databank

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.080 align:middle line:90%
from other authors.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And this databank is
extremely complicated.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:90%
This wasn't just love and light.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:84%
This was basically
multidimensional consciousness

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:84%
based on string
theory in relationship

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.540 align:middle line:84%
to various star systems
in the universe.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.479 align:middle line:84%
And so I know that at least four
people queried Bear & Company.

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine how many
people must have been querying

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.720 align:middle line:90%
publishers all over the place?

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So I very quickly
came to the conclusion

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.210 align:middle line:84%
that I had picked up
on a download that

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.950 align:middle line:90%
was affecting our planet.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And I then found out that
Edward Witten, the mathematician

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.080 align:middle line:84%
and physicist who invented
superstring theory,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.230 align:middle line:84%
he brought in his calculations
for superstring theory

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.630 align:middle line:84%
during the exact five
month period when I

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:90%
channeled The Pleiadian Agenda.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And also, Michael
Newton, the author

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:84%
of the wonderful
Journey of Souls,

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.080 align:middle line:84%
brought in the Journey of
Souls databank at that point.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to
go right down into the drill

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.710 align:middle line:84%
down into that because
that's the important part.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.020 align:middle line:90%
God is in the details, right?

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in
this case, you were

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:84%
shown that this was an amazing
cosmological universe of 11

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.870 align:middle line:90%
different dimensions.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And so when you were
originally shown

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.310 align:middle line:84%
this, what were the
first implications that

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.720 align:middle line:84%
were really stark and struck
you about this new reality?

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.209 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: For me, since I
didn't understand physics,

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't
understand mathematics,

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.850 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't imagine how I could
ever communicate this material.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.760 align:middle line:84%
So fortunately, we taped
all the channelings

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.530 align:middle line:84%
because we knew
it was important.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So I took all the channelings
and made a book out

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.120 align:middle line:90%
of the information.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And I did not change one
single thing in that databank.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And this was very
difficult for me

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.920 align:middle line:84%
because I am somewhat
knowledgeable in some

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.590 align:middle line:84%
of the fields that are
in this book, especially

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:84%
telluric realm, 2nd
dimensional information,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:84%
or geometrical information
in the sixth dimension.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And many things came
through in this databank

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.920 align:middle line:84%
that contradicted the current
level of human knowledge.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And so it was very hard for me
to keep it exactly the same.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.890 align:middle line:84%
But at this point, I'm
so grateful that I did.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Because as it turned
out, each piece of that

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:90%
was very important.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's disconcerting
when these

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.900 align:middle line:84%
are models that you
don't have any knowledge

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
of on a conscious level in
terms of making that decision.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.100 align:middle line:90%
How do you put it out there?

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.470 align:middle line:84%
If you've never
heard of it, then you

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.053 align:middle line:84%
know no one else has
ever heard of it.

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Do you start tinkering with it?

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Do you dumb it
down a little bit?

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.350 align:middle line:90%
Do you change the language?

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's takes a lot
of courage, I think,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.530 align:middle line:84%
to put it out as is when you
don't even understand what

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.875 align:middle line:90%
you're putting out in part.

00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: It was very
difficult. And then

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.041 align:middle line:84%
of course, right after that, I
needed to go out and teach it.

00:05:37.041 --> 00:05:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Because whenever I
write a book, I always

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.742 align:middle line:84%
go out for a couple of years
and teach the material.

00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And so when the book was
all finished, and of course,

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.860 align:middle line:84%
it was easy for me to
make it into a book

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.680 align:middle line:84%
because my job at Bear & Company
was as a structural editor.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.160 align:middle line:84%
I can take anybody material,
turn it into a book.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So I turned it into a very
enticing, fascinating book.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.692 align:middle line:84%
But I only understood half
the material in my own book.

00:05:58.692 --> 00:05:59.491 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:05:59.491 --> 00:06:01.320 align:middle line:84%
I was gonna say,
how did you teach it

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.100 align:middle line:90%
if you didn't understand it?

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: So then I had to
go and teach it, yeah.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of years
have intervened.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.590 align:middle line:84%
You've had a lot of
downloads, a lot of contact

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.750 align:middle line:90%
with these beings.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Over time, did you
begin to understand

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.830 align:middle line:84%
the qualities and nature of
these various dimensions?

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, you wrote
The Alchemy of Nine Dimensions.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.350 align:middle line:84%
So you got a lot more
downloads as time went on.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:84%
But how did that process
happen where you became aware

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.460 align:middle line:84%
of the qualities and the
functions of these dimensions?

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, by going
out and teaching it

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and not understanding
what I was doing.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.590 align:middle line:84%
First of all, lots of scientists
and lots of physicists

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.220 align:middle line:84%
showed up in the early workshops
and lots of spiritual seekers

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.810 align:middle line:90%
from many different dimensions.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, my
students taught me

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.890 align:middle line:84%
a lot about the dimensions
that I didn't understand,

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.440 align:middle line:84%
which was a wonderful
process for all of us.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And then also while
I was teaching,

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.270 align:middle line:84%
I was researching
furiously because what

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.880 align:middle line:84%
was I going to say if somebody
said, but wait a minute.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.800 align:middle line:90%
This scientist says this.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.510 align:middle line:90%
Or that scientist says that.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So after 10 years of
doing serious research

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.080 align:middle line:84%
while I was also teaching, I
realized I'd come to the point

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.670 align:middle line:84%
where the science that was
in the Pleiadian information

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.310 align:middle line:84%
had come around to dominate
the science that had been--

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.000 align:middle line:84%
in other words, science out
there in the real world started

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.470 align:middle line:84%
coming around to the positions
that the Pleiadians took.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.070 align:middle line:84%
So by the time they came
up to like 2003, 2004,

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and a scientist came
through with a proof

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:84%
for the seventh dimension and
what the Pleiadians said, then

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.710 align:middle line:84%
I said to my husband, we
have to write a book together

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.690 align:middle line:90%
because it's a huge databank.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And so Gerry Clow, my husband,
started working with me on it

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.160 align:middle line:84%
just because it had to
be a two person job.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.990 align:middle line:90%
It was such an undertaking.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:90%
So that came out in 2004.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, I kept on
researching and researching.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.670 align:middle line:90%
And more information came in.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And by 2009, 2010, the
databank was complete.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And all nine dimensions
had been fleshed out.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.510 align:middle line:90%
And so at that point.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.560 align:middle line:84%
I revised The Alchemy
of Nine Dimensions.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So anybody who ever
gets interested in this

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
should get the 2010 edition
because the major revision

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.000 align:middle line:90%
was in the fourth dimension.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.926 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth dimension rules
control of our human realm

00:08:10.926 --> 00:08:14.800 align:middle line:84%
and the Archons and the Anunnaki
and all that kind of stuff.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And it took me 30 years to
get that stuff straight.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.170 align:middle line:84%
So finally, I got
that stuff straight.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the 2010
edition really is

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.217 align:middle line:84%
crystal clear on the meaning
of the fourth dimension.

00:08:24.217 --> 00:08:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know what,
Barbara, when we did this-- you

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and I did a two part
interview on the alchemy

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.950 align:middle line:90%
of nine dimensions.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.289 align:middle line:84%
We did that up at your
place in Vancouver.

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.110 align:middle line:90%
But a weird thing happened.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know this or realize

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.909 align:middle line:90%
it or we debriefed about it.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:45.330 align:middle line:84%
But something happened
where we almost skipped

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.190 align:middle line:90%
over the fourth dimension.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.240 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.156 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: I do remember.

00:08:49.156 --> 00:08:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I thought how--
what happened in that room

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.496 align:middle line:84%
because that is not something
that normally happens.

00:08:53.496 --> 00:08:56.550 align:middle line:84%
How did we skip over the
most important dimension

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.710 align:middle line:90%
and its effect on Earth?

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And we skipped-- we
barely even introduced it,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.310 align:middle line:84%
went into the next
show, and it just--

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.290 align:middle line:90%
it's almost a missing piece.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:90%
What is it we missed in there?

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about
that because it's so

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:84%
affecting what's going
to happen on this planet.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.300 align:middle line:84%
It's affecting the whole
subject of disclosure.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.100 align:middle line:84%
So before we continue
this conversation,

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.160 align:middle line:84%
let's just pick up what
we didn't do last time.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, I think
it was me, Regina.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing I've ever
done when I've worked with you

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.760 align:middle line:84%
is hold back because I'm
there to express myself,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:84%
but the Anunnaki
situation is so tricky.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And I've dealt with it for
so many years in my own work

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.850 align:middle line:84%
that what I was still dealing
with was a Sitchin hold back.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many
millions of people out there

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.890 align:middle line:84%
who really believe that
Zecharia Sitchin has really

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.820 align:middle line:84%
figured out the real truth
about the Sumerian literature

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:90%
and about the Anunnaki.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And yet in my case, I
know that he did not

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.330 align:middle line:90%
translate things correctly.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And his description of the
Nibiru ruins and the Anunnaki

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.750 align:middle line:90%
is not correct.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.400 align:middle line:90%
Elements of it are correct.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've studied
the Enuma Elish,

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.840 align:middle line:84%
which is the sacred scriptures
from which this comes from.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.820 align:middle line:90%
And so I knew that he was wrong.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.820 align:middle line:84%
But there were still a
lot of problems out there

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.555 align:middle line:84%
in the field with saying what
you really think about Sitchin.

00:10:14.555 --> 00:10:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you think that
you were subconsciously

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.220 align:middle line:90%
holding back?

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And we just blew through
it and didn't get to it.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: No, I was
consciously holding back.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well,
let's talk about it.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Because in my
case as a publisher,

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of the people who
publish Zecharia Sitchin.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to say that I
totally value this man's work.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.685 align:middle line:84%
And I have great
respect for him.

00:10:30.685 --> 00:10:33.520 align:middle line:84%
It's just that in this
critical area of what's

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.680 align:middle line:84%
really going on with
a fourth dimension,

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.300 align:middle line:90%
he exaggerated things.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And basically, he
created a situation

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:43.840 align:middle line:84%
of misplaced concreteness, which
means that these beings are

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.820 align:middle line:90%
real in the fourth dimension.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.360 align:middle line:84%
They do affect us emotionally
and in the collective mind.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a matter of them
having a 3,600 year orbit that

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:84%
goes wherever the hell it
goes and that they actually

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.900 align:middle line:84%
land on Earth and
affect people on Earth.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Now that may be
true on occasion.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:84%
But he made it way, way
too airtight and way too

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.110 align:middle line:90%
much misplaced concreteness.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So then all of his
fans are sitting

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.030 align:middle line:84%
around waiting for
the Nibiruans to land.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:17.162 align:middle line:84%
And they've created another form
of what I call catastrophobia,

00:11:17.162 --> 00:11:18.370 align:middle line:90%
which is the fear of the end.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I
agree with that.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.450 align:middle line:84%
What about going back
to the original story,

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:26.314 align:middle line:84%
the anchor points of Enki and
Enlil and the original players.

00:11:26.314 --> 00:11:27.730 align:middle line:10%
Did you believes
that those beings

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.710 align:middle line:10%
did manifest in this
dimension, but not

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.347 align:middle line:10%
necessarily have continued on?

00:11:32.347 --> 00:11:34.930 align:middle line:10%
>>CLOW: Well, it's just like now
and whether somebody actually

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:10%
manifests physically or whether
they're actually influencing

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.680 align:middle line:10%
things in a spiritual way.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And so certainly, we
can be sure that back

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.950 align:middle line:84%
in the Sumerian times around
3,000, 4,000 years ago

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.970 align:middle line:84%
that these beings are
part of the pantheon.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:84%
After all, they
match the pantheon

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.110 align:middle line:84%
of other sacred
cultures on the planet.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And this was the period
basically 5,000 years ago

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.330 align:middle line:84%
when the gods were created
in the human psyche.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And probably, they also
actually do exist in some way.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But they came in as part of
the development of civilization

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:84%
and part of the
development of cultures

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.450 align:middle line:84%
that need to be
controlled according

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.810 align:middle line:90%
to human needs at the time.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.330 align:middle line:90%
I think it's changing now.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And so they were made into
gods so that people would

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.120 align:middle line:90%
worship them and would obey.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.419 align:middle line:84%
And that's the point
I've often made

00:12:20.419 --> 00:12:23.050 align:middle line:84%
when I do my own
lectures is we're still

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:26.080 align:middle line:84%
living under the detrimental
effects of that what was done

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
in that day now when it's
no longer appropriate, when

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.080 align:middle line:84%
our psyche is trying to
break free into something

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.780 align:middle line:84%
more multi-dimensional,
higher, and with more

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.406 align:middle line:90%
personal sovereignty, right?

00:12:36.406 --> 00:12:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yes, exactly.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this is an issue
that's coming to a head now.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Now I've come to the point only
about two or three months ago

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.380 align:middle line:84%
where I felt that I could
speak absolutely clearly

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.840 align:middle line:84%
about the relationship of
extraterrestrials and beings

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and other dimensions
in this dimension.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And something has
changed in our reality.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.390 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just the
millions of people out there

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.180 align:middle line:84%
who have faithfully
continued to think clearly

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.850 align:middle line:84%
regardless of the fear
that's been building up,

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.710 align:middle line:90%
regardless of the propaganda.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Because really, a
lot of what goes on

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.096 align:middle line:84%
in governments and religion is
basically Anunnaki propaganda.

00:13:12.096 --> 00:13:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.640 align:middle line:90%
It continues to this day.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: And the Archons.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Then what happens
when the Archons get in?

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.840 align:middle line:84%
The Archons are
just simply beings

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.000 align:middle line:84%
who are feeding
off of human fear.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:84%
But we need to be
courageous now.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.522 align:middle line:90%
And we need to go beyond fear.

00:13:25.522 --> 00:13:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
really at an edge

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.600 align:middle line:90%
at this point in that regard.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:90%
OK, now that was a--

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.010 align:middle line:90%
thank you so much.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad we took
that little side trip

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.800 align:middle line:90%
back to what we didn't do then.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought, how did
I drop the ball on that?

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.140 align:middle line:90%
I usually don't but.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.480 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for that.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.855 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: You dropped the ball
because every time you tried

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:44.165 align:middle line:90%
to question me, I blocked you.

00:13:44.165 --> 00:13:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, there you go.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.538 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Because it wasn't
time to say anything.

00:13:46.538 --> 00:13:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And Sitchin's group have
sued a lot of people.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And we were threatened
with lawsuits.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.750 align:middle line:84%
These people are
really, really insisting

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.450 align:middle line:90%
to have the right way.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:56.920 align:middle line:90%
And nobody has the right way.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.100 align:middle line:90%
We all have a piece of this.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We all have a piece.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So going-- so we've gone from
Edward Witten, Edward Witten

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and his discovery
of string theory

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.150 align:middle line:84%
and the existence
of 11 dimensions.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:12.310 align:middle line:84%
First of all, before
we go to the year 2012,

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:17.020 align:middle line:84%
how did his work and the work
that you were downloaded cross

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.970 align:middle line:90%
validate each other?

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, in my
case, as you know

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:24.490 align:middle line:84%
from Alchemy of Nine Dimensions,
I work with nine dimensions.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.950 align:middle line:84%
But that's simply because
the Pleiadians said--

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.330 align:middle line:90%
and I stuck with it--

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:84%
they said that humans
will have the ability

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.430 align:middle line:84%
to comprehend nine
dimensions of consciousness

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.611 align:middle line:90%
in 2012 and not '11.

00:14:35.611 --> 00:14:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
interesting because it's

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.130 align:middle line:84%
leaving out two of the
dimensions of string theory.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.620 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't actually do that.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.690 align:middle line:84%
The 10th dimension
is the vertical axis

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.330 align:middle line:90%
that ties all nine together.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And then the 11th dimension is
the all encompassing dimension,

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.690 align:middle line:90%
basically the universe.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:53.170 align:middle line:84%
But the Pleiadians
said work with nine

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:54.770 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
people can access.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's-- there's a
differential there because this

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.260 align:middle line:90%
becomes critically important.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Because now, the string
theory has been validated.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:04.690 align:middle line:84%
At the end of
2012, string theory

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:84%
was validated in the particle
accelerator in Zurich.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.760 align:middle line:10%
And so now, it's a
valid scientific theory.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And what's so
interesting about that

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.530 align:middle line:84%
is that string theory,
superstring theory,

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:22.230 align:middle line:84%
has implications as critically
important as quantum

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.400 align:middle line:90%
mechanics did.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And so as we sit here right
now, much of our technology

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.410 align:middle line:84%
is based on quantum
mechanics, which were

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.720 align:middle line:90%
discovered only 100 years ago.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, where is the discoveries
coming from superstring theory?

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Because superstring
theory should

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:41.650 align:middle line:84%
enable us to create a technology
in nine or 10 or 11 dimensions.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:43.860 align:middle line:10%
And so then, the
next big discovery

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.550 align:middle line:10%
in 2015 coming from
the Blue Brain Project

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.340 align:middle line:10%
is the discovery that
our brain actually

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:10%
does process reality in
11 distinct dimensions.

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.580 align:middle line:10%
So now we know we
think that way.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Now we know that the universe
is constructed that way

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.770 align:middle line:90%
based on superstring theory.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.050 align:middle line:90%
And so we're up--

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.250 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the reasons
we're up against an edge

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:84%
with disclosure of
extraterrestrial influence

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.772 align:middle line:90%
is that I really do believe--

00:16:10.772 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to
go into this databank

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.560 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not an
expert in this area--

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.670 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think there's any
doubt that extraterrestrials

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.710 align:middle line:84%
have offered
information to Earth

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.920 align:middle line:84%
through various governments
and through various systems.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And this information was
taken and has been the source

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.055 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of technology.

00:16:27.055 --> 00:16:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.429 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: But
unfortunately, what they

00:16:29.429 --> 00:16:33.270 align:middle line:84%
did with the discoveries was
they'd hidden it from us.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:36.030 align:middle line:84%
So there's all kinds of things
that should be available to us

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.090 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the reason we have not

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.870 align:middle line:84%
gotten much information
about technologies

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.940 align:middle line:90%
based on superstring theory.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I've been lately reading
a really good book

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:53.070 align:middle line:84%
on DNA analysis and
travel, cultures

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.570 align:middle line:90%
traveling all over the planet.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Ooh,
that's interesting.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Yeah, it's
a very good one.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
we always wonder about

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.500 align:middle line:90%
is junk DNA, right?

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: OK.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.890 align:middle line:84%
So in my universe,
junk DNA is obviously

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.557 align:middle line:84%
all the other dimensions
in our brains--

00:17:06.557 --> 00:17:07.431 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:17:07.431 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: --and in our
bodies, except for

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.540 align:middle line:90%
the third and fourth dimension.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.020 align:middle line:84%
So what the geneticists
do is they only

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:84%
work with things
that can actually

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.264 align:middle line:84%
be detected by means of physical
process, a disease or whatever,

00:17:19.264 --> 00:17:20.180 align:middle line:90%
or emotional conflict.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.589 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Material
scientific measures, yeah.

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:23.589 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Yeah, in the third
and fourth dimension.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:27.839 align:middle line:84%
But then the other 85%,
the junk DNA, at this point

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:28.960 align:middle line:90%
is lighting up.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And so to give you a
really good example

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.639 align:middle line:90%
of where this could go fast.

00:17:32.639 --> 00:17:35.055 align:middle line:84%
And I love being able to say
this so that some people will

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:36.160 align:middle line:90%
hear about this.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Why don't they hook up the Blue
Brain computers that detect 11

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.160 align:middle line:84%
dimensions-- and they not only
detect it, they've mapped it--

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.570 align:middle line:84%
why not hook that up with
DNA and see what happens?

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:45.945 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:17:45.945 --> 00:17:46.745 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:17:46.745 --> 00:17:49.505 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Because the other 85%
is suddenly going to be visible.

00:17:49.505 --> 00:17:51.005 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's
so fascinating.

00:17:51.005 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Isn't it true?

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.208 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And this, by the way,
speaking of why I'm here now,

00:17:55.208 --> 00:17:58.080 align:middle line:84%
I've only figured this out
in the last couple of weeks.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Everything for us is going
so fast at this point.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So many things are coalescing
for people at this point,

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:90%
aren't they?

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, now as you were able
to put these qualities

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.130 align:middle line:84%
and these functions
to the dimensions,

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.180 align:middle line:84%
now we bring the story
in of the 11 dimensions

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.220 align:middle line:84%
that were discovered
via string theory.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.160 align:middle line:90%
Have they been able to--

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to use the word map
like they did in Blue Brain--

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.410 align:middle line:84%
but have they been
able to detect

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.400 align:middle line:84%
any kind of qualities or
functions of these dimensions?

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.169 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: No, because
there are still

00:18:31.169 --> 00:18:33.460 align:middle line:84%
looking at everything from
a third and fourth dimension

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:90%
point of view.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Through
scientific materialism.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Right.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where I feel
that my work is so important

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.740 align:middle line:84%
because I feel that the
Pleiadian agenda and Alchemy

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:44.040 align:middle line:84%
of Nine Dimensions is giving
us a lot of information

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.910 align:middle line:84%
not only about the qualities
of at least nine dimensions.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.910 align:middle line:84%
But it's also, the
best part about alchemy

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.210 align:middle line:84%
of nine dimensions is it
has a Pleiadian agenda.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:59.280 align:middle line:84%
It has given us a data bank
on what human beings have

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.670 align:middle line:84%
been doing with
all nine dimensions

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:84%
since, as far as I can tell,
about 12,000 years ago.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think, before
12,000 years ago,

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:13.260 align:middle line:84%
before we had a series of
cataclysms on the planet,

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.630 align:middle line:84%
I actually believe that
humans that were here

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.000 align:middle line:84%
were basically very
multi-dimensional.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%
But the cataclysms
shut their minds down.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, they ferociously--
back 8,000, 7,000, 6,000 BC--

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:29.790 align:middle line:84%
attempted to create
things on the planet that

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.730 align:middle line:84%
kept us in a position to
access these dimensions.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:36.230 align:middle line:84%
For example, megolithic
creations, and Stonehenge,

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.460 align:middle line:84%
and the great pyramid
and things like that.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.070 align:middle line:84%
So alchemy and the
Pleiadian agenda

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.320 align:middle line:84%
actually give us
the databank of what

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.890 align:middle line:84%
humans have done with
multi-dimensional information

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.300 align:middle line:90%
until this moment in time.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.950 align:middle line:84%
It includes crop
circles because that's

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.670 align:middle line:84%
been a major
multi-dimensional input for us

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:58.316 align:middle line:84%
on this planet since the 1980s,
1970s, something like that.

00:19:58.316 --> 00:19:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that is
just popping into my mind

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.350 align:middle line:84%
as we're speaking about
this multi-dimensionality

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.110 align:middle line:84%
and the understanding of
this in the ancient, ancient,

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:11.574 align:middle line:90%
ancient times happened--

00:20:11.574 --> 00:20:12.990 align:middle line:84%
I had read something
in a document

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:14.520 align:middle line:90%
that I found fascinating.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And the document said, if
you have a chance, go and put

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:19.380 align:middle line:90%
your hands on the ancient--

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.430 align:middle line:90%
and I'm sorry.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.770 align:middle line:90%
It's in the British Museum.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.960 align:middle line:84%
I cannot remember
the name of him.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.010 align:middle line:84%
But it is a male-looking piece
of statuary from Easter Island.

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Easter Island is considered
to be the remnant of Lemuria.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And put your hands on
this entity, so to speak,

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.520 align:middle line:90%
and see what happens.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't touch anything
in the British Museum.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:43.590 align:middle line:90%
There are guards everywhere.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So I waited till
he turned his back.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And I went ahead, closed
my eyes, touched it.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And I just told my
being, tap in as fast

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.290 align:middle line:84%
as you can as much as
you can, and was given

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:53.920 align:middle line:90%
a download that was very rapid.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.040 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
is it was showing

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.670 align:middle line:84%
the multi-dimensionality of
the consciousness projected

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.240 align:middle line:84%
into this, quote,
statue in that day

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and how it was a receiver and
broadcaster even in that time

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:10.290 align:middle line:84%
as, quote, an inanimate object
working in different dimensions

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:90%
and signaling.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And this would have been
in the very earliest

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.075 align:middle line:90%
times of humanity's existence.

00:21:16.075 --> 00:21:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:17.783 align:middle line:90%
Well, we don't know.

00:21:17.783 --> 00:21:18.852 align:middle line:90%
This is a Maori.

00:21:18.852 --> 00:21:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
they're called.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Maori--

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:22.140 align:middle line:90%
That might be it.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.430 align:middle line:90%
I've just forgotten the name.

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:25.020 align:middle line:90%
He's a very blocky, big guy.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.311 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: My left brain isn't
that strong here right now.

00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:29.790 align:middle line:84%
But here's the
interesting thing.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:33.146 align:middle line:84%
The archaeologists have
tried to date these statues--

00:21:33.146 --> 00:21:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They can't.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: --back.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, they've tried
to say they're

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.290 align:middle line:84%
no more than 2,000 years
old, 2,500 years old.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no, no.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: I know, I know.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.350 align:middle line:90%
So here's the interesting thing.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.420 align:middle line:10%
Then, we go back
to Gobekli Tepe,

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.990 align:middle line:10%
which is a site basically
in Turkey of today.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:52.060 align:middle line:10%
And it has been carbon dated to
11,600 BC, or 11,600 years ago.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.390 align:middle line:90%
So right, yeah, 9,600 BC.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And so finally, meanwhile
on Easter Island, somebody

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.020 align:middle line:84%
decided, you know, all we've
got here is a head sticking up.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.454 align:middle line:90%
Why not dig down--

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To the
rest of the body.

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Dig down 40 feet down
to the bottom of the statue.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And the hand configurations
and the bodies

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:14.180 align:middle line:84%
of the Maori on Easter
Island are exactly the same

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.347 align:middle line:90%
as the ones at Gobekli Tepe.

00:22:15.347 --> 00:22:16.263 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:22:16.263 --> 00:22:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: So there's no
reason not to date that back

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.909 align:middle line:90%
to 11,600, at least that far.

00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At least, yeah.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: This is really important
because these different statues

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.230 align:middle line:84%
and different columns
are definitely

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:32.660 align:middle line:84%
infused with data because
they had a way of loading data

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:33.460 align:middle line:90%
into things.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
I'm constantly studying.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To be
able to load data

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:42.940 align:middle line:84%
into kind of the crystal matrix,
the silicone or whatever,

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.470 align:middle line:84%
the composition in those given
stones is just like a crystal.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:50.030 align:middle line:84%
They can hold information
for vast expanses of time.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: So then, I also
have written a trilogy

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.550 align:middle line:84%
that goes back 100,000 years
called The Mind Chronicles

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.860 align:middle line:84%
trilogy where I surveyed human
consciousness for 100,000

00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.670 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And in that survey,
I did it mostly

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:02.890 align:middle line:90%
by means of my past lives.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.350 align:middle line:84%
But I also could time
travel into anything.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a
piece of information

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.740 align:middle line:84%
that comes from a past life
where I was brought down

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.900 align:middle line:84%
from a higher
dimension and I was

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:17.610 align:middle line:84%
put into a statue
in an Olmec culture.

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is described in
The Mind Chronicles trilogy.

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.320 align:middle line:90%
And so what they did was--

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.720 align:middle line:90%
I was from some star system.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm really not sure which one.

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And they imprinted my
full stellar star codes

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.580 align:middle line:90%
into the statue.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, later on-- because
when you do past life

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:37.840 align:middle line:84%
regressions you
progress through time.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.870 align:middle line:84%
So then, later on,
they dug me up.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a
real direct pick-up

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.020 align:middle line:84%
on how this whole
thing actually works.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And since we're
having fun, years ago,

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.210 align:middle line:84%
I was regressed back
to a very ancient time.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:56.400 align:middle line:90%
And it was as a younger person.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.102 align:middle line:84%
And it was in a
classroom-like environment.

00:23:59.102 --> 00:24:00.810 align:middle line:84%
But we were obviously
being taught things

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:02.340 align:middle line:90%
that weren't ordinarily taught.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And one of them
was exactly that.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:06.930 align:middle line:84%
We were taught how to
take our consciousness

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and completely inject
itself into and occupy

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.400 align:middle line:90%
inanimate objects.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And we used to do
that with stones.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And that was part
of our practice

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:16.770 align:middle line:90%
for whatever it was we were--

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.600 align:middle line:90%
the role we were growing into.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.856 align:middle line:84%
And it was a common
practice at that time.

00:24:20.856 --> 00:24:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So again, just a
little more cross-validation

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:24.740 align:middle line:90%
of--

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And see, I think
this is post-cataclysmic,

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.810 align:middle line:84%
which means after
11,000, 12,000 years ago.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Where, as far as
I can tell, what

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:84%
happened on our planet was,
we basically were just--

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:38.580 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness was just blown
to smithereens, devastated.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Because our whole planet
was almost destroyed.

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And so it was critically
important to store data

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:84%
all over the planet at sacred
sites and in sacred object,

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:48.910 align:middle line:90%
critically important.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why these things
are so important to us.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:51.545 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:24:51.545 --> 00:24:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: So like in the
trilogy I'm writing,

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.970 align:middle line:84%
we have a Jungian
analyst, Lorenzo Giannini,

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:59.070 align:middle line:84%
who is using objects
like this in order

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:01.380 align:middle line:84%
to work with clients in
order bring data forth.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what I was going to say

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.290 align:middle line:84%
is because until
you have the means

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:06.810 align:middle line:84%
to be able to glean
what information

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:11.400 align:middle line:84%
is being held within them,
they're just artifacts.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they're inert.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.960 align:middle line:84%
So now, that gets us to this
other question of Michael

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Newton's work, Lives
Between Lives, this study

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.230 align:middle line:90%
of the lives between lives.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:27.840 align:middle line:10%
And you say that a lot of the
information that bubbled up

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:10%
through the psyche
of his clients really

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.850 align:middle line:10%
cross-validated
what you were seeing

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:37.230 align:middle line:10%
in these lives between lives--
and these previous lives

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:39.810 align:middle line:10%
over this 100,000
year span of time.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Give us an idea of
what that was like,

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:43.170 align:middle line:90%
some of the crossovers and such.

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, Michael Newton
had 700 case histories

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.840 align:middle line:84%
of traveling with
people between lives.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And this was a real
eye opener for me

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:53.340 align:middle line:84%
because I'd already done,
like, 100 past life regression

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.140 align:middle line:90%
sessions.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'd already written The
Mind Chronicles trilogy.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And when I was doing sessions
for the Mind Chronicles

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Trilogy, sometimes I
traveled between lives.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I did
travel between lives,

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I went into all kinds
of cosmic realms

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.860 align:middle line:84%
and other star systems,
other planets, and all

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.610 align:middle line:90%
this really amazing stuff.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I just reread
Michael Newton

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:16.230 align:middle line:84%
recently because of a client
that I was concerned about.

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered--
I found something

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.710 align:middle line:84%
in Michael Newton's book
that I hadn't noticed before.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Which was some of his
clients had reported--

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:27.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, they're having an
incarnation on Earth.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.190 align:middle line:90%
And they're his client.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And they also
reported that they're

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:34.770 align:middle line:84%
having a simultaneous
incarnation on the Pleiades

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:37.170 align:middle line:90%
or some star system.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, this was
mind-blowing to me.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Because as a child,
being part Cherokee,

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I was taught that I
was from the Pleiades.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, many cultures
believe that.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:46.870 align:middle line:90%
The Balinese believe that.

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:49.080 align:middle line:84%
A lot of Native
Americans believe that.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.940 align:middle line:84%
But that's a different
thing than saying

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.830 align:middle line:84%
that, while I'm
alive on this Earth,

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:56.467 align:middle line:84%
I'm also having a simultaneous
incarnation on the Pleiades.

00:26:56.467 --> 00:26:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
now that I've found

00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:59.820 align:middle line:84%
that validation
in Michael Newton,

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.190 align:middle line:84%
I've been reluctant to
talk about it very much.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.480 align:middle line:84%
But now, I'm totally
willing to talk about it.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And as we come to a point
of disclosure and truth

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.110 align:middle line:84%
about extraterrestrial
influence here,

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.940 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a big
part of the issue.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Steven Greer also talks
about his beings that surround

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:20.280 align:middle line:90%
him, which you can see.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.122 align:middle line:84%
If you have eyes to
see, you can see them

00:27:22.122 --> 00:27:24.330 align:middle line:84%
when he's doing a public
talk or whatever-- at least,

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I could back in the day
when I was in the same room.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about them openly,
the Pleiades, Pleiadians.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is why
the ufology community gets

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.580 align:middle line:84%
into these really
heated debates is

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:42.270 align:middle line:84%
because his perception
of extraterrestrials

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:43.200 align:middle line:90%
is through his lens.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Which is the Pleiadians, which
have come and have been here

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:52.110 align:middle line:84%
all along for their own purposes
and continue to influence

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:53.670 align:middle line:90%
today, including through you.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And he sees this as a
benevolent source, obviously,

00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:59.580 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Where others may come in from
another place, from Draco

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.190 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, and people
are perceiving a very

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.260 align:middle line:90%
deleterious effect on humanity.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think the conflict
occurs because he

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:13.950 align:middle line:84%
might be taking a very unnuanced
view that all of these beings

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:17.130 align:middle line:84%
are these wonderful beings who
have come to assist humanity.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Where someone else has
had some experience.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.907 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they've had an abduction
experience or something

00:28:21.907 --> 00:28:23.490 align:middle line:84%
in their psyche,
where they're saying,

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:84%
no, that's not what
happened to me.

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's no
different than the disparity

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:33.660 align:middle line:84%
between the different psychology
of the people on this planet.

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Every kind of ET has always
been here influencing us.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
disclosure takes on,

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.210 align:middle line:84%
I think, a different kind
of importance for you

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.500 align:middle line:90%
and me than it might for some.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not a scary event
at all once this occurs.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.250 align:middle line:84%
But we have to understand that
there are a lot of influences

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:50.050 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:53.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
Pleiadian influence,

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.590 align:middle line:84%
when that influence
began on this planet--

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:58.170 align:middle line:84%
before we get into some
of your own experience--

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:01.770 align:middle line:84%
what the general tenor of
it has been in the past

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and what it continues
to be today.

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: OK.

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:08.280 align:middle line:10%
So let's go to the issue
of a simultaneous lifetime.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm living out a
lifetime on Alcyone,

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.200 align:middle line:84%
which is the central
star of the Pleiades.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And on Alcyone I
live in a temple.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of like a
channel in a temple.

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And what I understand from
that experience and things

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:23.790 align:middle line:84%
that I've learned
being there, what I

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:27.445 align:middle line:84%
understand about that is that
the Earth in our solar system--

00:29:27.445 --> 00:29:30.470 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiades, of course, is
a star system at a distance.

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And on the Earth,
we are now going

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:36.450 align:middle line:84%
through an evolutionary
cycle that is basically

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.190 align:middle line:90%
the last 100,000 years.

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
Paleolithic cycle.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Or if you get into Calleman's
databank, Carl Johan Calleman's

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:46.160 align:middle line:84%
databank, this is
the fifth wave.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And in his system,
the fifth wave

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:51.820 align:middle line:84%
is a unitized very high
state of consciousness.

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And so according to
the temple on Alcyone,

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:58.860 align:middle line:84%
we have been involved in
this 100,000-year cycle with

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.469 align:middle line:90%
the Pleiadians influencing us.

00:30:00.469 --> 00:30:02.010 align:middle line:84%
They may have
influenced them before.

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:02.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:04.750 align:middle line:84%
But that's where I
know the influence.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's so interesting that
The Mind Chronicles trilogy

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.240 align:middle line:90%
covered that time period.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't
know about that.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So what the
Pleiadians are saying

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.514 align:middle line:84%
from Alcyone is that
we have now come

00:30:16.514 --> 00:30:18.930 align:middle line:84%
to the completion of this
cycle, that the end of the Mayan

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.860 align:middle line:84%
calendar and the period
of time that we're into--

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.580 align:middle line:84%
we're also, by procession,
entering the Age of Aquarius--

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and that this is the fulfillment
and completion of this

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.330 align:middle line:90%
100,000-year cycle.

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And so they have been
assisting us and aiding us.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.380 align:middle line:84%
They're very loving beings,
and they're great guides.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And they say we're coming
to this fruition point now.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think
disclosure is part of it.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that disclosure
has to be a factor--

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.350 align:middle line:90%
it has to happen--

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:50.750 align:middle line:84%
is that, because of
the secrecy and because

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.020 align:middle line:84%
of government and
military control,

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.310 align:middle line:84%
there has been a concerted
effort on this planet

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:57.860 align:middle line:90%
for the last 5,125 years.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
Anunnaki influence.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is the Sumerian
influence, religion.

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:06.050 align:middle line:84%
There's been a concerted
effort to reduce humans

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:07.751 align:middle line:84%
to the third and
fourth dimension.

00:31:07.751 --> 00:31:10.250 align:middle line:84%
So we're supposed to live here
in the third dimension, which

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.900 align:middle line:90%
is linear space and time.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, we're supposed
to be mind-controlled

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.510 align:middle line:84%
by the dark and the light from
the fourth dimension, which

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:19.790 align:middle line:84%
is controlled by the world
religions and the world

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.000 align:middle line:90%
governments.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the disclosure
has to come

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.890 align:middle line:84%
because the
disclosure will allow

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:27.050 align:middle line:84%
us to be in touch with all
those other dimensions,

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:29.610 align:middle line:90%
such as the Pleiadian dimension.

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the reason I'm
willing to be forthcoming now.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.045 align:middle line:90%
I live there and I live here.

00:31:34.045 --> 00:31:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I think
the obvious question

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:38.120 align:middle line:84%
in most people's
minds at this time

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.510 align:middle line:84%
is, OK, please tell us
about that experience living

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:46.700 align:middle line:84%
in this other place, this
other physical planet.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.650 align:middle line:84%
What does the quality
of that life feel like?

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And I know that, like
you say, you mostly

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:51.460 align:middle line:90%
feel cloistered in the temple.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.650 align:middle line:84%
You're not aware a lot
of outside experience.

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Which, even in going
back in lifetimes,

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:59.917 align:middle line:84%
I've found to where one was
in that situation, cloistered,

00:31:59.917 --> 00:32:02.000 align:middle line:84%
you really don't have a
lot of knowledge of what's

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.440 align:middle line:90%
going on on the outside.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.700 align:middle line:84%
But let's just talk about
the feeling in the body.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
way the body functions.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Is it more harmonious
and healthful?

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Technology, age spans,
life spans and all of that.

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about what you know
from this parallel existence.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, see, what you are
completing-- talk to you

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.000 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth-- you are
completing a cycle that we

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.450 align:middle line:90%
already completed.

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So once we got all the
way through that cycle,

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:32.300 align:middle line:84%
then what we did was we changed
a lot of things, especially,

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware, from the
temple, we changed

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.140 align:middle line:90%
the way we use technology.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.240 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
on the Pleiades--

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Alcyone in particular--
we have master computers

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:43.850 align:middle line:84%
in order to run
systems and in order

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:46.040 align:middle line:84%
to run all kinds of
things because computers

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.150 align:middle line:90%
are wonderful.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But people are not as
caught up and obsessed

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.940 align:middle line:84%
with using computers
as they are right now,

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.805 align:middle line:84%
especially all kinds of handheld
devices and stuff like that.

00:32:55.805 --> 00:32:57.305 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
was once the case?

00:32:57.305 --> 00:32:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:58.930 align:middle line:84%
This is a phase that
we went through.

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:00.013 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the Pleiades?

00:33:00.013 --> 00:33:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: This is a phase
that you go through

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:03.740 align:middle line:90%
in the evolutionary cycle.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
talking about here

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.120 align:middle line:84%
is a cycle that
enables our planet

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.540 align:middle line:84%
to be completely connected with
all of the different elements

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.870 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And so we go through
this computer cycle.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And we go through this
data merging cycle.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did it have the same
almost crazy-making corruptive

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:24.290 align:middle line:84%
type of influence on the
brains of the people?

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:25.998 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, whenever
you go through one

00:33:25.998 --> 00:33:28.400 align:middle line:84%
of these evolutionary stages,
it's always like that.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.670 align:middle line:90%
It's always very stressful.

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:32.270 align:middle line:84%
It's always very difficult.
Certain aspects of it

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.100 align:middle line:90%
are positive.

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.200 align:middle line:84%
But what I would like
to say is, one question

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.940 align:middle line:84%
would be, how do the
Pleiadians reach most of us?

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.700 align:middle line:84%
In my case, I happen
to have this kind

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.240 align:middle line:90%
of special experience.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.810 align:middle line:84%
But as far as I can see from
what I find on the Earth,

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:47.810 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of people are all
connected with the Pleiades.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.844 align:middle line:84%
And the way they reach
us is through the orbs.

00:33:50.844 --> 00:33:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Through the orbs--

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Through the orbs, right.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell
us about the orbs.

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, the orbs, as
you know, as soon as people

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.040 align:middle line:84%
started taking
digital photographs,

00:33:59.040 --> 00:33:59.930 align:middle line:90%
then they showed up.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:02.672 align:middle line:84%
There's something about
digital photography

00:34:02.672 --> 00:34:04.130 align:middle line:84%
that makes it
possible to see them.

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:05.546 align:middle line:84%
But there's certainly
every reason

00:34:05.546 --> 00:34:07.530 align:middle line:84%
to think that they
were there before.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:09.394 align:middle line:84%
And so when the orbs
are all over the place,

00:34:09.394 --> 00:34:13.609 align:middle line:84%
it's because the Pleiadians are
influencing our consciousness.

00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But did
they ever tell you

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:19.639 align:middle line:84%
the nature of those
little plasma fields, how

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:21.639 align:middle line:90%
it works as they're projected?

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:23.159 align:middle line:84%
Are there projected
thought forms,

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:25.460 align:middle line:84%
for example, that come in
through those little balls

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:25.894 align:middle line:90%
of plasma?

00:34:25.894 --> 00:34:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Yeah,
through the plasma.

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:29.353 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then, that is
absorbed in through the aura

00:34:29.353 --> 00:34:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately filters into the
brain to conscious awareness.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:33.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:35.378 align:middle line:84%
And plasma, of course, is
all throughout the universe

00:34:35.378 --> 00:34:39.739 align:middle line:84%
so that the orbs are also
awakening us to our connections

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:40.655 align:middle line:90%
all over the universe.

00:34:40.655 --> 00:34:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:43.699 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is the
state of health?

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:46.639 align:middle line:84%
And what are the
food groups, shall

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:49.820 align:middle line:84%
we say, the nutrient sources
of the people on the Pleiades?

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, first of
all, on the Pleiades

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:55.250 align:middle line:84%
we really believe and
experience that whatever we're

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.200 align:middle line:90%
thinking about creates reality.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.820 align:middle line:84%
So whether we eat
something or not,

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.810 align:middle line:84%
the most important thing is,
are we supposed to eat that?

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And we've learned
to tune ourselves

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:06.920 align:middle line:84%
into anything we
touch or anything

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:11.150 align:middle line:84%
we eat as to whether it's
efficacious for us or not.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, what was
your other question?

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
kind of food groups

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:16.550 align:middle line:84%
are those that are
still available?

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:18.650 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to know.

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, see, we have
a limited point of view here

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:24.740 align:middle line:84%
because of the way we've
manipulated reality.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And for example, the
Pleiadians are known

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:90%
to be the people of the cows.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and so for example, I can't go
buy a burger at Burger King.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't go in and eat there.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.580 align:middle line:84%
But remember when they used
to sell Whoppertunities?

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, whenever I used to
go by and see that sign,

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:43.170 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiadians would
jump up and down.

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.080 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
that they necessarily

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:49.650 align:middle line:84%
have limitations based on belief
systems as far as I can tell.

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:51.890 align:middle line:84%
It's more, are you
pure of heart and what

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:53.180 align:middle line:90%
are you thinking about?

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.490 align:middle line:84%
As you know, in many
indigenous native traditions

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:57.560 align:middle line:84%
there is no problem
eating an animal

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.090 align:middle line:90%
as long as you eat correctly.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:00.989 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
still eat animals--

00:36:00.989 --> 00:36:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: As far as I know.

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And but they do
many other things as well?

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Oh, yeah.

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.013 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cupcakes, do
they eat frivolously?

00:36:07.013 --> 00:36:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Lots-- lots of plants.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Sugar isn't really
very good for us.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's not.

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:12.460 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Better to eat berries.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I bring that up
because so many people say,

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.960 align:middle line:90%
see, I knew that.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the consciousness
that you put into

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:22.940 align:middle line:90%
and the belief around the food.

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:24.825 align:middle line:90%
This cupcake is making me whole.

00:36:24.825 --> 00:36:27.200 align:middle line:84%
When in reality, of course,
sugar can be pretty damaging.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.908 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And I just
remembered the thought

00:36:28.908 --> 00:36:31.080 align:middle line:84%
that I almost
slipped up on, which

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.080 align:middle line:84%
is the other fundamental
teaching that I think

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.510 align:middle line:90%
is really relevant to us today.

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Is that you are the only person
who can work with your health.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And so again, attuning
your consciousness

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:45.260 align:middle line:90%
to what you need to do.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.830 align:middle line:90%
So how do you do that?

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you become
multi-dimensional,

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.010 align:middle line:84%
you learn to slow your
consciousness down and get

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:53.900 align:middle line:84%
in touch with the
second dimension.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, the second dimension is
the telluric elemental world

00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.250 align:middle line:90%
below the crust of the Earth.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And the second dimension
creates the third dimension.

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And the second
dimension is filled

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:07.700 align:middle line:84%
with microbial intelligence
and military intelligence.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean, excuse me, not military.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.278 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not military?

00:37:10.278 --> 00:37:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: No, no, microbial
and mineral-- excuse me--

00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:14.820 align:middle line:90%
mineral intelligence.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you can learn the
technique of slowing down

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:21.640 align:middle line:84%
to the second dimension, you
will know exactly what to do.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And nobody else can
figure that out for you.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, tell
them how to slow down.

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:27.140 align:middle line:90%
How do you slow this down?

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: It's a
learned technique.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.880 align:middle line:84%
That's what I've written about
and taught for so many years.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Once somebody figures out how
to do it, once you get it,

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:36.590 align:middle line:84%
it's like a light
switch going on.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:38.000 align:middle line:90%
You go, hey, it's easier.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Like, I can walk
through Whole Foods

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:42.410 align:middle line:84%
and look at a bunch
of supplements

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:44.979 align:middle line:84%
and just walk by them
I can tell what to do.

00:37:44.979 --> 00:37:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Because you pick up eventually.

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, you
pick up the energy.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah, that's right.

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And their favorite
medical technique,

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.440 align:middle line:84%
if a person had
gotten really sick

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and is not able to
attune themselves,

00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:59.980 align:middle line:90%
is to use homeopathy.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.270 align:middle line:10%
Now homeopathy will
be-- and as you know,

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:04.124 align:middle line:10%
there's a huge
struggle on the earth

00:38:04.124 --> 00:38:05.540 align:middle line:10%
right now to shut
homeopathy down.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:06.540 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, there is.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:10.010 align:middle line:10%
>>CLOW: And homeopathy is
the most effective healing

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:13.460 align:middle line:10%
technique for humans
in the third dimension,

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.755 align:middle line:10%
or Pleiadians on
the third dimension.

00:38:15.755 --> 00:38:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very, very powerful.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.640 align:middle line:90%
What kind of age spans do--

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.405 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if it's even
relevant-- do they live to?

00:38:22.405 --> 00:38:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: I don't know.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.904 align:middle line:84%
There's one of the
things I don't know.

00:38:24.904 --> 00:38:27.080 align:middle line:84%
It always feels
very eternal to me.

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I do know one thing
though, Regina.

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:31.330 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability
to just check out

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:32.930 align:middle line:90%
when we're ready to check out.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to become
another fundamental battle

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:36.070 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Because right now,
older people are

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:40.670 align:middle line:84%
being trapped in institutions
and trapped in their bodies.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And everybody on
the planet Earth

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.050 align:middle line:84%
should have the right to
leave when they want to.

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:47.990 align:middle line:84%
There should be no restriction
on people needing to leave.

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:50.210 align:middle line:84%
That is just something
our generation especially

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:52.670 align:middle line:84%
is fighting for, now that
we've seen what happened

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:53.990 align:middle line:90%
to our parents' generation.

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Because the technology made
it possible to entrap people

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.170 align:middle line:84%
in these bodies that are
no longer really fighting

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:01.700 align:middle line:90%
on their own to live anymore.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.410 align:middle line:90%
The will isn't there anymore.

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:05.907 align:middle line:84%
It's just a heartbeat
that's kept going.

00:39:05.907 --> 00:39:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: So the sense
I get of it would

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:08.750 align:middle line:84%
be that people
just check out when

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:09.875 align:middle line:90%
they're ready to check out.

00:39:09.875 --> 00:39:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the relationships
between the people,

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:15.740 align:middle line:90%
the means of communication.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Would you say it just has,
what, more heart centered,

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:90%
more authentic?

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Or what would you call the
quality of the communications

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.680 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, first of all,
we're completely telepathic.

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting thing
about being telepathic

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.506 align:middle line:84%
is people think they
want to be telepathic.

00:39:29.506 --> 00:39:30.630 align:middle line:90%
And they think it'd be fun.

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:31.730 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:34.940 align:middle line:84%
But you can only
be 100% telepathic

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.470 align:middle line:90%
if you're 100% honest.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:38.920 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, what a nightmare.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine
that on this planet

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:43.280 align:middle line:84%
if it were all, if it
were switched on today?

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.312 align:middle line:90%
Yikes.

00:39:44.312 --> 00:39:45.520 align:middle line:90%
We'd probably have more wars.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:47.510 align:middle line:84%
That's why things
are going slowly.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:49.676 align:middle line:84%
They have to go slowly
because it takes a long time.

00:39:49.676 --> 00:39:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Because these are skills
that can be learned

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.870 align:middle line:90%
by any being in the universe.

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, so anything else you'd
like to share that people might

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.360 align:middle line:84%
be curious about from
life in the Pleiades,

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:06.830 align:middle line:84%
which simply sounds
like it is a generation

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:10.040 align:middle line:84%
or two in terms of evolutionary
cycles ahead of where we are?

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.284 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: It's more
than a generation.

00:40:12.284 --> 00:40:13.200 align:middle line:90%
Because first of all--

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean that
in a very long sense.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:18.814 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they got
beyond the war cycle.

00:40:18.814 --> 00:40:20.230 align:middle line:84%
What finally
happens-- and this is

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:21.646 align:middle line:84%
what we're going
through right now

00:40:21.646 --> 00:40:24.670 align:middle line:84%
is finding a way to get
beyond the war cycle, which

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.540 align:middle line:90%
has been the last 4,000 years.

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:27.650 align:middle line:90%
So they're beyond that.

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And for example, nobody has more
children than they should have.

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:34.570 align:middle line:84%
There's no problem with
population explosion and all

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:35.370 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:38.756 align:middle line:84%
Because there is no control over
forcing people to have babies.

00:40:38.756 --> 00:40:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, once you force
them to have babies,

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:43.180 align:middle line:84%
then you can take them away
at the border, for example.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.850 align:middle line:84%
So the most important
thing on the Pleiades

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:48.850 align:middle line:84%
is the children are
really cherished.

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:52.630 align:middle line:84%
The understanding of children
at this level of evolution

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:54.170 align:middle line:90%
is they're the next stage.

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:57.222 align:middle line:84%
And when a child is born on the
Pleiades and also on the Earth,

00:40:57.222 --> 00:40:58.930 align:middle line:84%
they already know more
than their parents

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:01.960 align:middle line:84%
do because they're the
next stage of time.

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.265 align:middle line:84%
So the children really are
the guides and the teachers.

00:41:05.265 --> 00:41:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And is that a matter of
reincarnation there as well?

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:14.250 align:middle line:84%
After they leave one earth
cycle, do they come back again?

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: All those
reincarnational cycles

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:18.020 align:middle line:84%
work the same all
over the universe.

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's where people
will discover, finally,

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:22.940 align:middle line:90%
that they can travel anywhere.

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:24.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the interesting
thing about

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:26.200 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial
issue is it isn't

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:31.930 align:middle line:84%
necessary to have spaceships
and things like that.

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:32.800 align:middle line:90%
They exist.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: But it's necessary.

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't need them.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.694 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Yeah, we
don't need them.

00:41:36.694 --> 00:41:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's take the information.

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.180 align:middle line:84%
You brought through so many
years of information now.

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And as you say,
this was happening

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:49.150 align:middle line:84%
in a mass download for those
who could, right, at that time?

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Back in '95 and
continues to this day.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And you say many people were
tapping into this download

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:55.780 align:middle line:90%
as it happened.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Scientists were perceiving
it in their own way.

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Another one, like
Barbara Marciniak

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:03.580 align:middle line:84%
is also well known
in this field.

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Did you find over the
years that your information

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.900 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of
cross-validation in it?

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Oh, yeah.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was Barbara's publisher
in the early stages.

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And we were picking up on the
same thing at the same time.

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:17.830 align:middle line:84%
So we're from a
really similar source.

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:20.651 align:middle line:84%
And there are all kinds of
different kinds of Pleiadians

00:42:20.651 --> 00:42:22.900 align:middle line:84%
who come from different parts
of the Pleiades and all.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.800 align:middle line:90%
That is very varied.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:25.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So all right.

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:29.140 align:middle line:90%
The downloads have occurred.

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:32.140 align:middle line:84%
You're now coming very
public with all of this.

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And now, we need to segue
over into the subject

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.580 align:middle line:84%
to disclosure-- as I talked
about at the very top

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:37.570 align:middle line:90%
of the show--

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:40.990 align:middle line:90%
and talk about it in some depth.

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Because first of all,
what have the Pleiadians

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.890 align:middle line:84%
told you the biggest
hang-up to disclosure

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:50.420 align:middle line:84%
has been up to
this point in time?

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.576 align:middle line:84%
And then, also,
why do you feel--

00:42:52.576 --> 00:42:54.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why Steven
Greer feels it's impending.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.449 align:middle line:84%
He probably has totally
different reasons,

00:42:56.449 --> 00:42:58.390 align:middle line:84%
other than perhaps
his Pleiadian guides

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:00.010 align:middle line:90%
are telling him the same thing.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:03.550 align:middle line:84%
But with you, what do
you feel has essentially

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:05.710 align:middle line:84%
switched on that
is going to make

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:07.630 align:middle line:90%
this possible in a good way?

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, first of all,
we're having a tremendous

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:13.000 align:middle line:84%
shifting of power going
on in this planet,

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.160 align:middle line:84%
and world leaders meeting
privately in order--

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:22.510 align:middle line:84%
for example, one of the things
that we've gotten from the UFO

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:25.960 align:middle line:84%
community is that there have
been many situations of some

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.550 align:middle line:84%
of the whistleblowers,
say, where

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:31.180 align:middle line:84%
humans tried to
blow up atomic bombs

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:32.870 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrial stopped it.

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:33.964 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, right.

00:43:33.964 --> 00:43:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: So there's lots of--

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:37.420 align:middle line:84%
all I'm trying to say is
there's lots of movement

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:39.130 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think
can actually be

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:40.340 align:middle line:90%
interpreted in any other way.

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Like, a lot of people
are really confused

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:44.490 align:middle line:84%
about what world
leaders are doing.

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when you start to look
at it from the point of view

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:50.244 align:middle line:84%
of disclosure, a whole lot of
things start to make sense.

00:43:50.244 --> 00:43:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I would suggest
that people might

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:53.429 align:middle line:90%
want to consider doing that.

00:43:53.429 --> 00:43:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't know
about you, but I

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:56.804 align:middle line:84%
hate not being able to
make sense of things.

00:43:56.804 --> 00:43:57.603 align:middle line:90%
I hate it.

00:43:57.603 --> 00:43:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:43:58.990 --> 00:43:59.790 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:02.470 align:middle line:84%
There has to be
something coherent

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:04.240 align:middle line:90%
to the story that's emerging.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And right now, the story
feels very incoherent.

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:08.990 align:middle line:90%
People are struggling.

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:12.230 align:middle line:84%
People that I love
and am close to

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.980 align:middle line:84%
are even just
struggling in crazy ways

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:18.620 align:middle line:84%
that I've never seen happen
en mass like this before.

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:20.920 align:middle line:90%
And what is your perception?

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:24.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they say the darkest
hour is before dawn, right?

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you take that
axiom and work with it,

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:29.680 align:middle line:84%
what is it that we're
seeing right now?

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, we're seeing
the early and deep entry

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.180 align:middle line:90%
into Aquarius.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:37.330 align:middle line:84%
We go into a new precessional
sign over a period

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:39.490 align:middle line:90%
of about 200 or 300 years.

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:45.700 align:middle line:84%
But it always comes to a vortex
point, a critical leap point.

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And so back in 2011 I
thought about, well,

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:51.040 align:middle line:90%
what am I going to do now?

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Because I finished my Pleiadian
agenda and alchemy material.

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided that
period from 2011 to 2020

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:01.487 align:middle line:90%
would be the key turning point.

00:45:01.487 --> 00:45:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
reason why I decided

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:04.920 align:middle line:84%
to write The
Revelations trilogy,

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:08.170 align:middle line:84%
because I decided to
track human history

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and human movement
on the planet as we

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:13.180 align:middle line:90%
move into the Age of Aquarius.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
things I wanted to show

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.550 align:middle line:84%
is how difficult it is to
let go of the previous age.

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Like, right now, we're letting
go of the age of Pisces.

00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And the age of Pisces is
the age of organized warfare

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:28.130 align:middle line:84%
and organized religion,
especially religion.

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Like the age of Aries
4,000 years ago to 0 AD,

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:35.040 align:middle line:90%
that was the age of warfare.

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And then, from 0
AD to 2000 AD, we

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:42.560 align:middle line:84%
have wars for God, which
is what's been going on.

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.220 align:middle line:90%
And we can't do it anymore.

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Everybody on the planet
knows we can't do it anymore.

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:50.360 align:middle line:84%
So we're in the middle of
letting go of all those belief

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:54.870 align:middle line:84%
systems, including the Anunnaki
control belief systems that

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:56.510 align:middle line:90%
are controlled by the Archons.

00:45:56.510 --> 00:46:01.670 align:middle line:84%
We're letting go of some really,
really heavy, difficult energy.

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a push
right now on the planet

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.620 align:middle line:84%
to even push it
further, like things

00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:09.630 align:middle line:84%
like taking children away
from their parents at borders.

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:13.310 align:middle line:84%
This is so retrograde
and backwards

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:14.990 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what
we should be doing

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:16.800 align:middle line:90%
on the planet at this time.

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very difficult
period to live through

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.530 align:middle line:84%
because, as we let
things go, we also

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:23.330 align:middle line:90%
have attachments to things.

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, as the new
energy comes in--

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.750 align:middle line:90%
since we're not used to it--

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.220 align:middle line:90%
it's difficult too.

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And so Aquarius rules
computer technology.

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we're having a tremendous
struggle with people getting

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:37.490 align:middle line:84%
used to using
computer technology,

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:38.590 align:middle line:90%
the Age of Aquarius.

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
also having a struggle

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.339 align:middle line:84%
in the opposite where
it's taken over our lives.

00:46:42.339 --> 00:46:43.339 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:46:43.339 --> 00:46:44.630 align:middle line:90%
That's what I mean by struggle.

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:48.060 align:middle line:84%
To me, anything that takes
over is the struggle.

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:52.970 align:middle line:84%
We're having a big struggle
with computer technology and DNA

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:55.040 align:middle line:90%
and medical issues and stuff.

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.990 align:middle line:90%
These are huge, huge issues.

00:46:56.990 --> 00:47:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm tracking
it in the trilogy

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:03.380 align:middle line:84%
through a series of really
intelligent characters,

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:07.110 align:middle line:84%
because I want a databank
on this turning point.

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
it back in 2011.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And boy, has it turned
out to be prophetic.

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And we are really, really
in it at this point.

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But meanwhile,
during this period of time,

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:18.110 align:middle line:90%
there is a sense of craziness.

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:22.730 align:middle line:84%
There's this kind of this deep
struggle for self identity

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:26.625 align:middle line:84%
that people are having that they
don't know what's up and down.

00:47:26.625 --> 00:47:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They are
being manipulated

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.570 align:middle line:84%
by these outside Archonic
forces, as you say.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:35.120 align:middle line:84%
The media and the
world of technology

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.440 align:middle line:84%
are the greatest
probably propagators

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.680 align:middle line:90%
of the manipulation, right?

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.570 align:middle line:90%
As well as useful tools, right?

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And so it leaves everyone
with the perception

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.850 align:middle line:84%
that time is speeding up
and that everything is

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:48.170 align:middle line:90%
going to hell in a hand basket.

00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:49.790 align:middle line:84%
That's what
everyone's left with.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Plus, it's just
anxiety and fear.

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:55.025 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to go
right to disclosure.

00:47:55.025 --> 00:47:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:56.956 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Let's say I'm right.

00:47:56.956 --> 00:47:58.650 align:middle line:90%
Let's say Steven Greer is right.

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:00.320 align:middle line:90%
And let's say it's coming.

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, what are you going to do?

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Because we've been
manipulated to be

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:07.200 align:middle line:84%
stuck in the third
and fourth dimension.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.079 align:middle line:84%
We've been manipulated to think
that little green men from Mars

00:48:10.079 --> 00:48:11.870 align:middle line:84%
are going to land and
take over the planet.

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And probe us.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:16.182 align:middle line:84%
And so when disclosure
comes, with military being

00:48:16.182 --> 00:48:18.140 align:middle line:84%
as it is and the governments
being as they are,

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:20.450 align:middle line:84%
they're going to try
to shock the human race

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:24.650 align:middle line:84%
into a state of fear so
that, when it happens,

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:27.200 align:middle line:84%
that they can
control the dynamic.

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the amazing
thing about being human

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.690 align:middle line:84%
is we have access
to nine dimensions.

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:34.846 align:middle line:84%
We're not stuck in the
third and fourth dimension.

00:48:34.846 --> 00:48:35.646 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:48:35.646 --> 00:48:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And if ever it was
important for people to tune

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:40.850 align:middle line:84%
into these other
dimensions-- for example,

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:45.050 align:middle line:84%
the fifth dimension is the
dimension of unconditional love

00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:46.430 align:middle line:90%
and the open heart.

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you hear
about a disclosure

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:51.410 align:middle line:84%
and if you hear some crazy
thing or some holographic image,

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:53.450 align:middle line:84%
somebody is floating
in a cloud or whatever

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:56.750 align:middle line:84%
they're going to do,
go into your heart.

00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Go right into your heart.

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And deeply go inside
and ask yourself,

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:07.035 align:middle line:84%
are you afraid of the
military or extraterrestrials?

00:49:07.035 --> 00:49:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: What are you afraid of?

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:11.182 align:middle line:90%
Like, I'm afraid of doctors.

00:49:11.182 --> 00:49:12.515 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Me too, I'm terrified.

00:49:12.515 --> 00:49:12.842 align:middle line:90%
I never go.

00:49:12.842 --> 00:49:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: I won't go
anywhere near doctors.

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:14.815 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Me neither.

00:49:14.815 --> 00:49:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: So tune in deeply
to how I feel in my heart.

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you tune into
your heart, expand your heart.

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Expand the knowledge
that you have within.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to go right
into the sixth dimension.

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And the sixth dimension
is the dimension

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.930 align:middle line:84%
that gives us a really
good take on the real truth

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:35.630 align:middle line:84%
about what's actually
happening on this planet.

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:38.997 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I think if people
study my definitions of this

00:49:38.997 --> 00:49:40.080 align:middle line:90%
it would get them further.

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.290 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Alchemy of Nine
Dimensions, absolutely.

00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:43.530 align:middle line:10%
And they can watch
our interviews too.

00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:44.090 align:middle line:10%
>>CLOW: Right, yeah.

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:45.280 align:middle line:10%
They can watch the interviews.

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.130 align:middle line:10%
It's true.

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:48.770 align:middle line:10%
But for instance,
the eighth dimension

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:51.440 align:middle line:10%
is the dimension of divine
knowledge and divine

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.640 align:middle line:10%
consciousness.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.980 align:middle line:84%
If you hear something
that scares you

00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:58.700 align:middle line:84%
about extraterrestrial
interference on this planet,

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.620 align:middle line:84%
tune into what you
know about God.

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't work
with God very much.

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:06.290 align:middle line:84%
I work with divine universal
intelligence, which is fine.

00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:09.020 align:middle line:84%
But tune in, and you'll
find you'll immediately

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.160 align:middle line:90%
get a message right back.

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.750 align:middle line:84%
If you can just
avoid all the noise

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:middle line:84%
of the third and
fourth dimension,

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.710 align:middle line:84%
you'll immediately get
the information there's

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:17.840 align:middle line:90%
nothing to fear, nothing.

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, absolutely.

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think the thing is
that we have been programmed,

00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:27.820 align:middle line:84%
obviously, for the last 50
years through the media,

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:30.820 align:middle line:84%
for the most part, to fear
any kind of connection

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:32.260 align:middle line:90%
with other beings.

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Again, to keep us in
that state of fear

00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:37.302 align:middle line:84%
keeps us easy to
manipulate and control.

00:50:37.302 --> 00:50:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Every now and then, you'll see
something of more benevolent

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.770 align:middle line:90%
nature that comes through.

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you'll even see kind
of nuanced information come

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.220 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:47.110 align:middle line:84%
But the vast majority of
it has been fear-driven.

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:47.984 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:50:47.984 --> 00:50:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I think for
people to simply understand,

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:53.680 align:middle line:90%
don't go into fear over this.

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And this whole UFO
community, they're

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:58.070 align:middle line:84%
always at each other's
throats on this one.

00:50:58.070 --> 00:50:58.870 align:middle line:90%
Are they good?

00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:59.560 align:middle line:90%
Are they bad?

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:00.310 align:middle line:90%
Are they evil?

00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:01.476 align:middle line:90%
Are they here to control us?

00:51:01.476 --> 00:51:03.090 align:middle line:90%
Are they here to help us?

00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, that's not
even the right question anymore.

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:11.470 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me there's
something much larger

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:12.350 align:middle line:90%
than that happening.

00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell
my point of view,

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:15.730 align:middle line:84%
but I want you to tell us
your point of view instead.

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, whenever you're
in the fourth dimension,

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.730 align:middle line:84%
you're being reduced to,
is it good, is it bad?

00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:22.055 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:51:22.055 --> 00:51:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: When, in fact,
that's a stupid question.

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:25.799 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
is good and bad.

00:51:25.799 --> 00:51:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Because it
depends upon what

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:29.950 align:middle line:90%
you're going to do with it.

00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually think people
should be preparing themselves

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:36.610 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly what
would happen, isn't it,

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:40.860 align:middle line:90%
at this point?

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At a cross-over time
when one age is dying and a new

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:43.600 align:middle line:90%
one is--

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, let's go
back to the Pleiadians.

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Pleiadians said in
1995 that all nine dimensions

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:52.510 align:middle line:90%
would blast open in 2012.

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly in 2012,
according to the Pleiadians,

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:57.310 align:middle line:90%
we are all nine dimensional.

00:51:57.310 --> 00:52:00.040 align:middle line:84%
So they're saying-- speaking
of the Blue Brain Project,

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and speaking of the way our
brains process information--

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.090 align:middle line:84%
they're saying that all of a
sudden it's like our brains

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:09.770 align:middle line:84%
have just flipped
open, wide open.

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
reason things feel

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.480 align:middle line:90%
so chaotic and so confused.

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.216 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:52:15.216 --> 00:52:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk to you
about this notion of dimensions

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:20.410 align:middle line:84%
because this, again, is
a very confusing topic

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:21.410 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people.

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:23.560 align:middle line:84%
There is the ascension
sect of people

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:27.430 align:middle line:84%
that feel that they're going
to shed the physical, become

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:30.280 align:middle line:84%
shimmering light, and
that's their next iteration,

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.441 align:middle line:84%
and it's immediate--
that, boom, it's going

00:52:32.441 --> 00:52:33.565 align:middle line:90%
to happen like the rapture.

00:52:33.565 --> 00:52:36.490 align:middle line:90%


00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:37.930 align:middle line:90%
That's not how I perceive it.

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:39.340 align:middle line:90%
We're still on this Earth.

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:40.960 align:middle line:90%
We're still in these bodies.

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:45.070 align:middle line:84%
But we're accessing all these
other levels of consciousness.

00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:46.390 align:middle line:90%
That's how I see it.

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:47.370 align:middle line:90%
How do you see it?

00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Oh, I see it
exactly the same way.

00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And the Pleiadians start
cracking jokes at this point

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.790 align:middle line:84%
because they point out that
your only access to ascension

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and higher levels of
consciousness is your body.

00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:52:58.640 --> 00:52:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: So here we are.

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:00.760 align:middle line:90%
We can do yoga.

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:01.660 align:middle line:90%
We can have sex.

00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:05.300 align:middle line:84%
We can tune in with all kinds
of wonderful music and things

00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:06.100 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.030 align:middle line:90%
Our access is our body.

00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So one of the most profound
things about this teaching

00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:14.620 align:middle line:84%
is how important it is to
be profoundly located in 3D.

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's linear space
and time, your life.

00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And most people are
spending 95% of their time

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:23.624 align:middle line:84%
in the dark in the
fourth dimension.

00:53:23.624 --> 00:53:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And the minute you're
in the fourth dimension,

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.622 align:middle line:84%
you're just going
from pillar to post.

00:53:27.622 --> 00:53:29.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's why people are
being pulled this way, being

00:53:29.830 --> 00:53:32.470 align:middle line:84%
pulled that way, and the
media is manipulating it

00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:33.460 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And the easiest
technique by far is just

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.920 align:middle line:90%
to get back in your body.

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:39.985 align:middle line:90%
Let the media go.

00:53:39.985 --> 00:53:40.986 align:middle line:90%
Go out in nature.

00:53:40.986 --> 00:53:42.610 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to do
that all the time.

00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:44.860 align:middle line:84%
But tune back into
nature because nature

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.310 align:middle line:84%
is the field of
consciousness around us

00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:50.760 align:middle line:84%
that feeds us and supports
us in the third dimension.

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so many of the
mystery schools, and even

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:56.050 align:middle line:84%
gnosticism, is
always teaching you

00:53:56.050 --> 00:53:58.930 align:middle line:84%
how to free yourself
from the matrix

00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:01.330 align:middle line:84%
of the physical, free
yourself from Earth life

00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:05.500 align:middle line:84%
to be able to move into
these non-physical realms

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:08.700 align:middle line:90%
of experience and beauty.

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:10.312 align:middle line:90%
I've never felt that way.

00:54:10.312 --> 00:54:12.895 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, I don't know how
much time we have here, Regina.

00:54:12.895 --> 00:54:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We still have
a few minutes, so please.

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: OK, because
the gnostic--

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.522 align:middle line:84%
the interpretation we've
gotten of the gnostics

00:54:17.522 --> 00:54:18.730 align:middle line:90%
has been from the Christians.

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, guess who's the
gnostics really were.

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:25.720 align:middle line:84%
The gnostics were
teachers about how

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.780 align:middle line:84%
to shift from one great
age to the next one.

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they would, over
the last 10,000 years,

00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:34.990 align:middle line:84%
the various gnostic teachers--
especially 2,000 years ago--

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:37.720 align:middle line:84%
would appear in order
to instruct humanity

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.000 align:middle line:84%
on how to let go of
the old age and how

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.490 align:middle line:84%
to integrate the new one,
which is exactly why I

00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:44.140 align:middle line:90%
am writing the trilogy.

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So the gnostics are not about
how to get out of your body.

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:49.600 align:middle line:84%
They're about how
to be in your body

00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and make an
effective transition.

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as
we'll find out when

00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:56.530 align:middle line:84%
we go to your series of
books, this includes beauty.

00:54:56.530 --> 00:54:57.820 align:middle line:90%
This includes art.

00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:59.710 align:middle line:90%
This includes sexuality.

00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:04.300 align:middle line:84%
It includes completely embodying
all of these frequencies

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:05.856 align:middle line:90%
as access points, as you say.

00:55:05.856 --> 00:55:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah, that's right.

00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you tune into beauty
and you tune into art,

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:11.530 align:middle line:90%
this is a very good place to go.

00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Because when you do that,
when you're really into art

00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:15.710 align:middle line:84%
or into beauty--
which is, again,

00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:18.520 align:middle line:84%
why I'm writing
about a painter--

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:21.410 align:middle line:84%
what happens then is
you're fully in your body.

00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that you're
tuned into art and music

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:26.710 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness is
because you're also

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:28.600 align:middle line:90%
tuning into other dimensions.

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you tune into
higher dimensions-- and also

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.120 align:middle line:84%
lower dimensions, by the way,
the first and second dimension.

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:37.620 align:middle line:84%
The first dimension is
the source of omniscience

00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:39.280 align:middle line:90%
and the source of--

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:41.010 align:middle line:90%
it's like the Akashic records.

00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:44.080 align:middle line:84%
When you go to the dimension,
you can know anything.

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And so but you
can't do any of this

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.040 align:middle line:90%
without being in your body.

00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's the kind
of the cosmic joke.

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is the cosmic joke.

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've always been
a big defender of Earth.

00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:58.190 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I think we
have a beautiful planet here.

00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:59.560 align:middle line:90%
I think we're very fortunate.

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And if we could learn
how to keep it that way,

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:05.230 align:middle line:84%
and if we could learn how to
use our bodies as the tuning

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:07.510 align:middle line:84%
forks and the
receivers, transmitters

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:09.950 align:middle line:84%
that they truly
are, that is heaven.

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Don't need to go--

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And also, there's
something very special

00:56:12.610 --> 00:56:13.180 align:middle line:90%
about Earth.

00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There is.

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Earth is a biological
planet for the universe.

00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And Earth is a place where
cycles of evolution and cycles

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:25.030 align:middle line:84%
of biology are
developed and processed.

00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:26.780 align:middle line:90%
This is a very special place.

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:29.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know if there
is another place like Earth.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Here, here-- you
and I are on the same page.

00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:35.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big fan of Earth.

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.655 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a big fan of our using
this amazing instrument we've

00:56:38.655 --> 00:56:39.455 align:middle line:90%
been given.

00:56:39.455 --> 00:56:42.580 align:middle line:10%
>>CLOW: And so the universe
and cosmic intelligence

00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:45.070 align:middle line:10%
is extremely concerned
about what's going on

00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:46.420 align:middle line:10%
on the Earth right now.

00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Because we could easily solve
all of our ecological problems

00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:52.360 align:middle line:84%
if we used all of the
resources to solve

00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:55.660 align:middle line:84%
the problems instead of fund the
military to create more wars.

00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:56.890 align:middle line:90%
And so that's the conflict.

00:56:56.890 --> 00:56:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:56:57.690 --> 00:56:59.595 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: But the
universe and the cosmos

00:56:59.595 --> 00:57:01.720 align:middle line:84%
is concerned about what's
happening here right now.

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.630 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason there's so
much extraterrestrial input

00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:05.489 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:57:05.489 --> 00:57:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
so much, Barbara.

00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:09.070 align:middle line:84%
It's been a wonderful
conversation with you.

00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for having
the courage to share

00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:14.740 align:middle line:84%
what you have not been sharing,
this really intimate part

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:17.590 align:middle line:84%
of yourself in your
ongoing connection--

00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:21.130 align:middle line:84%
not connection with-- but
reality with the Pleiades,

00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:22.920 align:middle line:84%
on the Pleiades, and
with the Pleiadians.

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:25.295 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Yeah, and thank you
for this opportunity, Regina,

00:57:25.295 --> 00:57:28.420 align:middle line:84%
because it's time for
everybody to speak now.

00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Enlightening conversation,
as always, with Barbara.

00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:37.120 align:middle line:84%
To check into how this ties
together in all of her work,

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.910 align:middle line:84%
you can look at her new book,
which is called Revelations

00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:40.900 align:middle line:90%
of the Aquarian Age.

00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:42.546 align:middle line:10%
It's now out through
major booksellers.

00:57:42.546 --> 00:57:44.920 align:middle line:10%
And it's wonderful because it
takes all of these concepts

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:47.410 align:middle line:10%
and ties them all together
in a work of fiction that's

00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:48.340 align:middle line:10%
very juicy.

00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:51.280 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
