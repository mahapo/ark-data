>>REGINA MEREDITH: Many spend
their entire lifetime searching

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.380 align:middle line:10%
for their destiny, while
others can't avoid it,

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.720 align:middle line:10%
even if they try.

Chetan Parkyn and
his teacher both fall

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.980 align:middle line:90%
into the latter group.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Chetan was an engineer
when he ended up in India

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.280 align:middle line:90%
as the driver of a magic bus.

And this is where his
incredible story begins.

Rather than getting into
all of your credentials--

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.710 align:middle line:84%
I love this part-- let's
start even earlier than that.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Because people can
begin to understand that

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:84%
you're kind of a natural
magician in some way at heart.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And you had your
very first experience

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.360 align:middle line:90%
at the age of-- what was it?

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Four?

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.270 align:middle line:90%
Sitting in a tree.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Will you share that with us?

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.700 align:middle line:10%
>>CHETAN PARKYN: Yes.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.080 align:middle line:10%
I have to say, I grew up in
a very well-to-do situation

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.190 align:middle line:10%
in England.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.630 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh,
surprise, surprise.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKYN: And I didn't have
an awful lot of contact

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:10%
with my parents
in the early days.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.860 align:middle line:84%
But I did have nannies,
and nurse maids,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.470 align:middle line:90%
and other people around me.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And at the age of
four, I realized

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.450 align:middle line:84%
that what was going on around
me was not in my best interests.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And I literally found myself
sitting in a tree wondering,

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.990 align:middle line:84%
what is this that's
going on here?

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm very clear with myself.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.640 align:middle line:84%
hat it is that I'm here to do
and play out in this lifetime,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and I'm being contradicted
every which way I turn.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.000 align:middle line:84%
So I had a bit of a wake
up sitting in that tree,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.490 align:middle line:84%
realizing in that time I had
three friends in the world.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.718 align:middle line:84%
Two of them were trees,
and one was a cow.

00:01:54.718 --> 00:01:56.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And the cow was called
Belinda, and Belinda

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.040 align:middle line:84%
let me used to ride around
her going around the field

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:84%
while she was eating
her grass and stuff.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
understand that, though,

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.199 align:middle line:84%
that magical world
of nature where

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:84%
things are really breaking
down more in the human world.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:84%
What was happening behind
the walls of your home

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
that made you feel so
disconnected from it?

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Just
everywhere I looked,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.000 align:middle line:84%
things were not running in what
I saw as a truthful pattern.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.400 align:middle line:84%
That people were living
out of integrity.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.650 align:middle line:90%
And it was really quite a shock.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:84%
So in that early
time, I found out

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.640 align:middle line:90%
that I had to be aware of what--

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you knew
is the difference in what

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.570 align:middle line:84%
was in and out of
integrity at four?

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.760 align:middle line:84%
You could tell there were
certain obvious patterns.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Definitely, yes.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So I buckled down, got into
the system, put up with it all.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Went to boys boarding school,
went through all of that.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.574 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's kind of harsh.

00:02:48.574 --> 00:02:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Boys boarding
school, yes, you know,

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.700 align:middle line:90%
it was the English way.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Get the boys to be
independent so they

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.612 align:middle line:84%
become good bankers,
or civil servants,

00:02:56.612 --> 00:02:57.570 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you take them
away from their moms so early.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Seven years old
on a strange door step.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: With strange
outfits and stuff.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.410 align:middle line:84%
But after that, I had a
couple of years to travel.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.400 align:middle line:84%
I had time in France
picking grapes.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:90%
That was a wonderful exercise.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:90%
I had time in America.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.950 align:middle line:90%
It was during the Vietnam War.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:84%
There was a huge break in
consciousness going on there.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: And that
was very refreshing.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you find
yourself out in San Francisco?

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Actually, I
got as far as Denver,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and traveled all
over the States.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:26.820 align:middle line:90%
Had a wonderful time.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.360 align:middle line:84%
It was a time when
people were hitchhiking.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.380 align:middle line:84%
There was a very open
atmosphere everywhere.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And I learned a
lot in that time.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.150 align:middle line:90%
I then went back to England.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.590 align:middle line:84%
I'd grown up on a farm, and
like to operate on the farm,

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.640 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of machinery
would break down,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.750 align:middle line:90%
and I had no idea how to fix it.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to
learn how to fix it.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I ended up in
engineering school,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:84%
got a good degree
in engineering,

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.400 align:middle line:90%
did an apprenticeship.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, I qualified
as a mechanical engineer.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Did quite a bit of
traveling like that.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.600 align:middle line:84%
I was involved in a National
Geographic diving expedition

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.310 align:middle line:90%
off Greece.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.580 align:middle line:84%
I did yacht delivery from
the Bahamas to Europe

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.960 align:middle line:90%
and got caught in a hurricane.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And there was no reason our
boat should have stayed afloat.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:90%
We should have sunk.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.910 align:middle line:84%
We came into the Azores in
the middle of the Atlantic,

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.043 align:middle line:84%
and the harbor master
came down and said,

00:04:18.043 --> 00:04:20.209 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how you got
in here, because everything

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.620 align:middle line:90%
else out there has sunk.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.130 align:middle line:84%
We can't even send
the life boat out.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And I had a realization
during that trip.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Life is very precious,
and I actually

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.350 align:middle line:84%
had a viewing, what I could say,
through the veil at that time,

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.920 align:middle line:84%
of just seeing there is an
alternative to what we accept

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.690 align:middle line:84%
as the normal way of
things in this world.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you you by
chance during all of that,

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.570 align:middle line:84%
when you finally hit shore, did
you go on shore in the Azores?

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is a total aside.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:84%
How did you feel
about those energies?

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Because it is said in
some ancient teachings

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Mount Pico is a
remnant of Atlantis.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.610 align:middle line:90%
It was very soothing.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.330 align:middle line:90%
It was very familiar.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:84%
It was different,
but very familiar

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
also, you had lived.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:90%
That's a good thing.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
But soothing in another
sense of the word?

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes, it was soothing.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.840 align:middle line:90%
You know, it was such a shock.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.140 align:middle line:84%
We were eight days and nights
being thrown around all

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:90%
over the place.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, god,
I can't fathom.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: --in this hurricane.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, we
should have sunk.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And even when we
came into the harbor,

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.010 align:middle line:84%
the sea was breaking
right over the sea walls.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.600 align:middle line:84%
They had never seen
a storm like this,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.725 align:middle line:84%
the hurricane was just
there all the time.

00:05:32.725 --> 00:05:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were the only
ship whose passengers survived?

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yeah.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Everything else sunk-- fishing
boats, small merchant ships.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.600 align:middle line:90%
Everything sank.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.191 align:middle line:90%
It was an ordeal.

00:05:43.191 --> 00:05:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: After it was over,
I don't mean to be trite,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.070 align:middle line:84%
but did you feel there must have
been some kind of protection

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.677 align:middle line:84%
around your little
vehicle, you know?

00:05:49.677 --> 00:05:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes, absolutely.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That this
happened for you all?

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.466 align:middle line:90%
And it made it really clear.

00:05:54.466 --> 00:05:57.230 align:middle line:90%
You now, don't mess up.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.590 align:middle line:90%
Don't make a waste of your life.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what I really got
from that experience.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now after that,
your career as an engineer,

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.392 align:middle line:84%
was that kind of before or
after this whole period?

00:06:09.392 --> 00:06:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: No, that
was during the period.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: During the period.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:90%
That was a job you were out on.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: I basically
was sent to the Bahamas

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.580 align:middle line:84%
to fix up this boat, get
the engines in good shape,

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.220 align:middle line:84%
get everything shipshape,
and sail it back to Europe.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we did.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you've had
this harrowing experience,

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:90%
and you're back.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.810 align:middle line:90%
You have this skill set.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.360 align:middle line:84%
What happened for you
to transition from that

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.020 align:middle line:90%
to driving a magic bus?

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Well, I went into
retreat for a couple of years.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.110 align:middle line:84%
It was such an
intense experience.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: I went and
lived in little croft

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:84%
house in the Shetland Islands,
which is up by Norway.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.980 align:middle line:90%
Very remote.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.520 align:middle line:84%
The nearest house
was a mile away.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.170 align:middle line:84%
I had no telephone,
and it was storm swept.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And I did a little
bit of diving there.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Again, just keeping that
side of things open.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:90%
But it was a retreat period.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end of that
period, my father passed away.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And he was a great ally
for me in this lifetime.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.420 align:middle line:84%
He'd always been encouraging me
and empowering me in my life.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very sad
thing when he passed away.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.840 align:middle line:84%
I went back down to England,
went to his funeral,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.940 align:middle line:84%
took his ashes up to
a place in Scotland

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.619 align:middle line:84%
that he'd loved, and
scattered the ashes for him.

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Went back to this little
croft house again,

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:84%
and I was sitting there, head in
hands, on a very stormy night,

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.884 align:middle line:84%
and I felt him come into the
room when I was sitting there.

00:07:25.884 --> 00:07:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like he went
around the room a couple of.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Times and what I heard from
him was, it's all right,

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.760 align:middle line:90%
you can go now.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And a sequence of
events just led me then

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.720 align:middle line:90%
to finding this work.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.830 align:middle line:90%
I can hardly call it work.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.010 align:middle line:90%
It was like an adventure--

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: --driving the magic
bus backwards and forwards

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.370 align:middle line:90%
from London to Kathmandu.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I just love it.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's really
akin to some of the buses

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.060 align:middle line:84%
you used to see driving
around in Haight Ashbury

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.310 align:middle line:90%
from an American point of view.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yeah.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how long would
one of these tours take?

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.677 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of
people went on them?

00:08:00.677 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Well, the tours would
take anything from three weeks

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.510 align:middle line:84%
to three months, depending
on various uprisings

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.310 align:middle line:90%
or breakdowns.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.900 align:middle line:90%
So whatever along the way.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:84%
But literally I set
off from London,

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.480 align:middle line:84%
crossed the channel
with the bus,

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and would go drive
to various cafes

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:84%
around Europe, where people
would have been informed ahead

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.380 align:middle line:90%
of time, magic bus is leaving.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.590 align:middle line:90%
Be here this night.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.620 align:middle line:90%
$60, one way to India.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.155 align:middle line:90%
And filled the bus up, 43 seats.

00:08:26.155 --> 00:08:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my god.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.615 align:middle line:84%
So you picked people
up along the way.

00:08:28.615 --> 00:08:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't
start with a tour group?

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: No, no, no, no.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:90%
People just jumped on board.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:34.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I'm coming on this trip.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.619 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: $60, or pounds, or
well, there weren't euros then,

00:08:37.619 --> 00:08:38.419 align:middle line:90%
to India?

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:39.330 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty cheap.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: It was very cheap.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was an
extraordinary journey.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.700 align:middle line:90%
They were all seekers.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Many of them had
been in India before.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was the one
person on board

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.200 align:middle line:84%
who had no idea
where we were going.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were the driver.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:52.375 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: I was driving it.

00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:53.175 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:53.175 --> 00:08:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's so exciting.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.100 align:middle line:84%
So you're still
now in your 20's.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Mm-hm.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you end up
in India at one point,

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and you must have
gone to an ashram.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Did you go to Pune?

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.960 align:middle line:90%
Or where did you go?

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.990 align:middle line:90%
There was appointed times.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:09.370 align:middle line:90%
27 years old.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I'd done all kinds of trips
backwards and forwards.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.160 align:middle line:84%
I did a trip through Africa,
and down through the Sahara,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:90%
and across through Zaire.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And when I got to Kenya
at the end of the trip,

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.310 align:middle line:90%
I basically hit the wall.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Nothing was making
sense to me anymore.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.510 align:middle line:90%
I had learned engineering.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.800 align:middle line:84%
I was good at it, but
it just didn't fit

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:90%
in my life somehow or other.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So I flew to India, and I knew
I'd get my answer in India.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:90%
It was just one of those things.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:84%
India is a very amazing
place like that.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, I ended up in
Osho's Ashram in Pune in India.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.170 align:middle line:84%
I later found out that 26 out of
the 43 people on that first bus

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.540 align:middle line:84%
trip were on their way
there in the first place.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, so you didn't have
any context for that initially.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: No idea at all.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what an amazing
experience in that time,

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.890 align:middle line:90%
and also community.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:10:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And Osho himself-- I live in
Sedona, and in my early years

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.740 align:middle line:84%
there, there were still a lot
of people-- there was a big Osho

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:03.850 align:middle line:90%
community there.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.100 align:middle line:84%
They always had the most
pristine businesses, the best

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.070 align:middle line:84%
aesthetics, cleanest
standards, best food.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.150 align:middle line:84%
What is it that fostered
that in that community

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and through, I'm assuming,
some of the teachings of Osho

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.420 align:middle line:90%
himself?

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: The commonality
of Osho's work

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.980 align:middle line:84%
is that we live from our heart,
not so much from the head,

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:24.780 align:middle line:90%
from the heart.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, and that's a common
thing amongst all his people,

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.340 align:middle line:84%
is that there's very much
a heart energy involved.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.310 align:middle line:84%
I recognize his
people right away,

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.610 align:middle line:84%
his senescence right away,
because that is the framework.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And he would say, you know, the
woman's way, or the heart way,

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.860 align:middle line:84%
was definitely
something that needed

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.572 align:middle line:90%
to be embraced in these times.

00:10:45.572 --> 00:10:47.530 align:middle line:84%
You know we're shifting
out of the Piscean Age.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.670 align:middle line:90%
We're in the Aquarius Age now.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
different thing.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:84%
It's an age of
personal empowerment.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And Osho's whole
thing was, look,

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.740 align:middle line:84%
we've had the tribal
thing going on,

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.660 align:middle line:84%
where it was always God's
fault, or the King's

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:84%
fault, or the prime
minister's fault, or somebody.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.800 align:middle line:90%
The victim mentality.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.580 align:middle line:84%
We've moved into the
collective age, which

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:10.175 align:middle line:84%
I suppose the Greeks started
with the democracy thing,

00:11:10.175 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:84%
and we've come to
a point in time

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:90%
now where that doesn't work.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And in the Aquarian
Age, it's all

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.340 align:middle line:84%
about the power
of the individual,

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.700 align:middle line:84%
that everybody has to take
responsibility for themself.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.875 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: So
probably what you've

00:11:20.875 --> 00:11:22.800 align:middle line:84%
experienced around
the people in Sedona

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.960 align:middle line:84%
is that everybody takes
care for themself,

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.007 align:middle line:84%
and they hold things
in a high frequency.

00:11:27.007 --> 00:11:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a
very high frequency.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And you know, most people
only remember the news clips

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.650 align:middle line:90%
from Oregon.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.540 align:middle line:84%
That's all anyone
knows of Osho, is

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
this crazy guru with all the
Rolls Royces, and the so forth.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.856 align:middle line:84%
The people that have given up
everything to stay with him,

00:11:47.856 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and he spent all their
money on Rolls Royces.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
average person knows

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.250 align:middle line:90%
when they hear the word Osho.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us
who he really was?

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Some of the background
of this individual?

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Because I've read
some of his work.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.107 align:middle line:90%
He's brilliant.

00:12:00.107 --> 00:12:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: He was
absolutely brilliant.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And the major part
of his brilliance

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.050 align:middle line:84%
is he said nobody's ever
going to make a religion out

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.250 align:middle line:84%
of anything he's
done, unlike what

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.850 align:middle line:84%
happened to poor Jesus,
or Muhammad, or Buddha,

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:90%
or everybody.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Basically, he said
one thing one time,

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.090 align:middle line:84%
he would say the complete
opposite another time.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.220 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant logician.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.140 align:middle line:84%
He was the debating
champion in India.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.227 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I remember reading.

00:12:24.227 --> 00:12:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: And there was
this famous occasion where

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.250 align:middle line:84%
he went to the
championship debate,

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:29.790 align:middle line:90%
and his opponent didn't show up.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He did both sides.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.868 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: He did both sides
and won for his opponent.

00:12:32.868 --> 00:12:33.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:39.970 align:middle line:84%
But such a nuanced mind and
depth of understanding he had.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Why did he do the string
of Rolls-Royces and such?

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.335 align:middle line:84%
What kind of statement was
he trying to make there?

00:12:46.335 --> 00:12:48.751 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: How else are you
going to push people's buttons?

00:12:48.751 --> 00:12:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He did it basically
just to go like this.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: He said
it was a big joke.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.440 align:middle line:84%
How many cars can
you drive at once?

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yeah.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.436 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so he
was always pushing--

00:12:56.436 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:84%
that was his whole point, was
to push buttons and break down

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.830 align:middle line:84%
stereotypical
ideas of teachings.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: We lived on this big
muddy ranch for five years.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And when it rained mud,
you know, foot thick mud,

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:84%
it was a most
extraordinary exercise.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.910 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Plodding around, trying to
make things happen through mud.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And all the time,
you know, expanding

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.520 align:middle line:84%
our sense of what it is
that was important for us.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a beautiful
Gurdjieffian exercise

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.930 align:middle line:84%
that he used to do with his
disciples, George Gurdjieff.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:27.794 align:middle line:90%
Dig a hole.

00:13:27.794 --> 00:13:29.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, he'd
looked at the hole.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.010 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:30.920 align:middle line:90%
Now fill it up again.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: And that's pretty
much what we did at the ranch.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.530 align:middle line:84%
We built a whole city
there, and then we left.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: And it
was an exercise.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But people
seem to still feel

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:44.690 align:middle line:84%
so fondly about their days
when they were in community.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Wonderful fun.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.554 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: If you're
around people

00:13:47.554 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and everyone's living
from their heart,

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and everyone has the
common intention,

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.460 align:middle line:84%
you know love is a very, very
essential component here,

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.310 align:middle line:84%
we're all working on
behalf of each other,

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle line:84%
there's no competitions
going on here,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.830 align:middle line:84%
we're just working for
each other, of course,

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.000 align:middle line:84%
community is wonderful
when it's done

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.390 align:middle line:90%
in a conscious way like that.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, we start getting into where
the story, your personal story,

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:12.900 align:middle line:90%
transitions.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.910 align:middle line:84%
So he would give
lectures every day.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:19.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the technical
word was for what he did.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:90%
But he lectured each day.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And people would
always have questions.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And there were too many,
too many personal questions,

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.765 align:middle line:84%
so he would send those
people to a shadow reader.

00:14:28.765 --> 00:14:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Indirectly.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: He would
put out a suggestion.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.386 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: You know,
I'm confronted

00:14:33.386 --> 00:14:35.384 align:middle line:84%
with everyone's personal
questions every day.

00:14:35.384 --> 00:14:37.300 align:middle line:84%
There's far too many
questions-- because there

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.320 align:middle line:84%
were thousands of people
there, from all over the world.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.414 align:middle line:84%
And the suggestion
would be, if you really

00:14:43.414 --> 00:14:45.080 align:middle line:84%
want to find out about
yourself, there's

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.800 align:middle line:84%
a man that lives in Bombay,
now Mumbai, go and talk to him.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.160 align:middle line:90%
He'll tell you everything.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And you'll never need to
ask me another question.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.310 align:middle line:84%
So I was very quiet
in those days.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.440 align:middle line:84%
I took him up on that,
and I went to Bombay.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.877 align:middle line:84%
It was quite a
trip getting there.

00:14:58.877 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How far is
it from Pune to Bombay?

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: It's 150 miles,
something like that.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So it was a train ride down
the hill, catch the train

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.120 align:middle line:84%
first thing in the morning,
taxi ride around Bombay.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.110 align:middle line:84%
The guy had no idea where
we were trying to go.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.000 align:middle line:90%
So around and around in circles.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.462 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we find
where this building is.

00:15:15.462 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And I knock on the door, and
he comes to the door and says,

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.720 align:middle line:90%
oh great.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.670 align:middle line:90%
I was expecting you.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.940 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't made any kind of
appointment I was aware of.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:84%
But anyhow, he said, go
downstairs with my son.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.060 align:middle line:84%
He's going to take
a measurement.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And then come back upstairs,
and I'll tell you all about it.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.870 align:middle line:84%
So we go downstairs
to the parking lot.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And he's got this
funny looking ruler

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.760 align:middle line:90%
with color markings on it.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.419 align:middle line:84%
I stand barefoot
in the parking lot.

00:15:39.419 --> 00:15:40.460 align:middle line:90%
He takes his measurement.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.290 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't paying attention.

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.110 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea who
he was measuring,

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:84%
whether it was my shoulder, or
the top of my head, my aura,

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.960 align:middle line:90%
whatever he was measuring.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Back upstairs, he
gives his father

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:54.790 align:middle line:84%
the calculation or
the numbers he's got.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.130 align:middle line:90%
Dad makes a calculation.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:90%
He asked for my birth date.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Does an astrological
calculation for that.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Asks me my name.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Does a neurological
calculation for that.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.730 align:middle line:84%
He's now triangulated three
different calculations.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:10.310 align:middle line:84%
He's got this huge long
bookshelf behind his desk.

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Throws his chair along, and
it's about seven or eight layers

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:90%
of books.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.960 align:middle line:84%
All these books look
identical to me.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.720 align:middle line:84%
He pulls out one book,
brings it back to the table,

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.780 align:middle line:84%
opens to a page,
and starts reading.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you say they
were all black, you told me.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:25.005 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: The covers.

00:16:25.005 --> 00:16:26.712 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All the
books were black?

00:16:26.712 --> 00:16:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: The covers on them.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:28.880 align:middle line:90%
You know, the bindings.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the
bindings are all black.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yeah.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do they have
anything written on the spine?

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: I was not honestly
not paying attention.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.338 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have
these rows and rows

00:16:36.338 --> 00:16:37.860 align:middle line:90%
and rows of black books.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like a novel I read
recently, but go ahead.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:40.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.340 align:middle line:90%
So he pulls out of a black book.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yeah.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:43.949 align:middle line:90%
A specific one.

00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:45.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, he's done
this calculation.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.080 align:middle line:84%
He opens up to a
specific page and starts

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.880 align:middle line:84%
reading for me, a thousand
lifetimes ago this,

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.170 align:middle line:84%
hundred lifetimes ago that,
10 lifetimes ago the other.

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Last week, this week, next week.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Parents' names, religion
you were brought up in,

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.050 align:middle line:90%
work you've been doing.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:90%
And he took-- the

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And was he accurate?

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:05.636 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Spot on.

00:17:05.636 --> 00:17:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everything?

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Oh, yeah.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.069 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Out of this book
were your parents' names?

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:09.869 align:middle line:90%
Everything?

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:10.869 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
just-- I mean--

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.099 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This really
begs a lot of questions.

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Comprehensible.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:18.859 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: You know, you can
imagine I'm sitting there.

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:20.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm 27 years old.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, I don't know
up from down anymore.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And he's just telling
me everything.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, OK.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.560 align:middle line:84%
So this does beg a
lot of questions.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And one of them, I
would like to ask

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:34.380 align:middle line:84%
you is as he was telling
you about these lifetimes,

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.510 align:middle line:84%
were there any kind
of common threads

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.380 align:middle line:84%
that you could see in yourself
that led to what you are now?

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: At of time, yes.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: But in this
particular moment in time,

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.885 align:middle line:90%
honestly, I can't remember.

00:17:43.885 --> 00:17:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you recognize
kind of trends passing through?

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: It was obvious, yes.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:84%
It was like he
kept hitting notes,

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:84%
and the notes were just
always in the right key.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You must have been,
in your parlance, gobsmacked.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:00.410 align:middle line:90%
Very well put.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
how- I mean, have you

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:84%
since figured out what that
was, and who would have made

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.990 align:middle line:90%
such recordings in these books?

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And explain this to us,
because this means there's

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.600 align:middle line:90%
a predestiny to everything.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: OK.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.547 align:middle line:84%
There's a predestiny, but just
like a river will come down

00:18:20.547 --> 00:18:22.380 align:middle line:84%
the hill into a tributary,
and the tributary

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.284 align:middle line:84%
will go various different
ways into the ocean,

00:18:25.284 --> 00:18:26.450 align:middle line:90%
it's the same kind of thing.

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:29.580 align:middle line:84%
He was able to point out
certain possible routes

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.760 align:middle line:90%
that my life would take.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.185 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: So it wasn't
like the destiny

00:18:33.185 --> 00:18:35.430 align:middle line:90%
was absolutely fixed in stone.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, everything
leading up to this moment,

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:84%
it was up to me to make a clear
choice what was to happen next.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it would have been
marked there not as past tense,

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.690 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, but the
readings essentially

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:84%
would have stopped at the point
they knew you would find him.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Who in the world would
have recorded all this?

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Except he was
also telling the potentials

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.570 align:middle line:90%
for further on [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right, right.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.160 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't set, like your
mother's name, father's name,

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:02.960 align:middle line:90%
so forth.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: What I've since
understood is that some 3,000,

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.040 align:middle line:84%
4,000 years ago, all of this
information was channeled.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:84%
It may be even longer than
3,000, 4,000 years ago.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.900 align:middle line:84%
It was channeled
and it was inscribed

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:18.850 align:middle line:84%
in a way in a technology that
we're not aware of anymore.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There is a
popular book out now called

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.690 align:middle line:84%
"Book of Souls," and the story's
based on this very topic,

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:31.240 align:middle line:84%
but that it was generation
after generation of monks.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.760 align:middle line:90%
It was in a monastery in France.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Could have been England,
but I think France.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.056 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered these books,
book after book after book,

00:19:40.056 --> 00:19:42.680 align:middle line:84%
called "The Book of Souls," and
it told your birth, your death,

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.000 align:middle line:90%
your name, all of this.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And they were downloading
this information.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: What I understand
in this Indian tradition,

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.364 align:middle line:90%
it was one person that did it.

00:19:51.364 --> 00:19:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How could they
even do that in a lifetime?

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Exactly.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.337 align:middle line:84%
They say it's a technology that
we're not aware of anymore.

00:19:56.337 --> 00:19:57.670 align:middle line:90%
The power of the mind, you know?

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.450 align:middle line:84%
The power of the
brilliance in humanity

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:90%
that is yet to reappear.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is just to
me such a fascinating part

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.990 align:middle line:90%
of your story in and of itself.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.019 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: So anyway, he gets to
the end of his reading with me,

00:20:10.019 --> 00:20:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and he closes the book up,
and he turns to me and says,

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:14.309 align:middle line:84%
I want you to come and
work with me, because you

00:20:14.309 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:90%
know how to do this work.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now there's
another surprise for you.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yeah.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's like, huh?

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.290 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm an engineer.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, apparently a
retiring engineer now,

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.230 align:middle line:84%
because you're telling
me that something else is

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:27.880 align:middle line:90%
going to happen in my life.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.614 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I paused
to think about it.

00:20:30.614 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what
does that involve?

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And it means moving
here to Mumbai.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:35.710 align:middle line:90%
It means learning Sanskrit.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.830 align:middle line:84%
It means learning this whole
new thing-- and it's like, no,

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I've just come out of university
and all these years of struggle

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.840 align:middle line:84%
trying to learn
engineering and stuff--

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I went to
public boy's school.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:44.998 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes, exactly.

00:20:44.998 --> 00:20:46.210 align:middle line:90%
It's like I need a break now.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:47.460 align:middle line:90%
I need something different.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I
turned him down flat.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And he thought that
was very funny.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.370 align:middle line:90%
He just cracked up laughing.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Because here was I
with somebody who

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.400 align:middle line:84%
couldn't see being offered
something by the world

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:90%
expert who could see.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.020 align:middle line:84%
He could see exactly what
my life and capabilities

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:03.940 align:middle line:90%
was about.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.760 align:middle line:90%
And I was turning him down.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And when he stopped laughing, he
said, well, it doesn't matter,

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.250 align:middle line:84%
because you're going
to do this work anyhow.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a system that's
going to come into your life.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:15.766 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
write books about it.

00:21:15.766 --> 00:21:17.390 align:middle line:84%
It's going to go out
in many languages.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.860 align:middle line:84%
It's going to go into
all corners of the world.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.020 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be introduced
to thousands of people

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:22.820 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to change
their lives forever.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.440 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:90%
That sounds great.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.980 align:middle line:90%
You know, thank you.

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can't see.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:31.480 align:middle line:90%
Nothing there.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.220 align:middle line:90%
Shadowed.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.636 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: He said
well, then, what

00:21:33.636 --> 00:21:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest for you is
before this system shows up

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:41.130 align:middle line:84%
in your life, learn some
way of being able to read

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:44.930 align:middle line:84%
for people-- because you've
got this gift-- be able to read

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.920 align:middle line:84%
for people to tell them
things about themselves

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.090 align:middle line:84%
that they've forgotten
or that they don't know.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:50.890 align:middle line:90%
And I said OK.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:84%
So I left that reading,
went back up to Pune again.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.640 align:middle line:90%
I was in the Ashram for a week.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was working in the
boutique in the Ashram in Pune.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.660 align:middle line:84%
The boutique, basically, there
were about four guys in there.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.010 align:middle line:90%
And everyone else was a woman.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.210 align:middle line:84%
It was a completely
feminine atmosphere.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.262 align:middle line:90%
It was just wonderful.

00:22:11.262 --> 00:22:12.720 align:middle line:84%
You know for somebody
that had been

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.900 align:middle line:84%
in boy's boarding school and
engineering school and all

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:15.130 align:middle line:90%
that stuff--

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Beautiful colors,
and fabric, and lotion.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: --I was bathed in
this wonderful feminine energy.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, you
know, it being a boutique,

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:26.117 align:middle line:84%
they sold a lot of
clothes, a lot of items.

00:22:26.117 --> 00:22:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it was
brought in from outside,

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.690 align:middle line:90%
from the community in Pune.

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And this one lady was delivering
this whole new set of outfits,

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.520 align:middle line:90%
and robes, and things.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.690 align:middle line:90%
And her husband came along.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And he was a
psychic palm reader.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And we were just sitting
there passing the time of day.

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said I'd like
to look at your hands.

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:45.010 align:middle line:90%
Fine, you know.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:46.290 align:middle line:90%
So I show him my hands.

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And he starts telling me
a whole bunch of things

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:51.080 align:middle line:84%
that the shadow reader had
told me the week before.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And then he insists on
showing me how to read hands.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:54.460 align:middle line:90%
I say, OK, fine.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.760 align:middle line:84%
So you know he shows me
around the hands, what all

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.470 align:middle line:90%
the markings and the swirlings.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.140 align:middle line:84%
For about 10 minutes he shows
me everything he can show me.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Folds my hand up, and says
that's enough now, practice.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So I go home to
where I'm staying

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.896 align:middle line:84%
that night in the funky
little hotel outside Pune.

00:23:12.896 --> 00:23:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting with my friends
in the outdoor restaurant

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:16.650 align:middle line:90%
there at the table.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying you know the
funniest thing happened today.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:22.050 align:middle line:84%
This guy showed me
how to read hands.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And in the space of
about 10 seconds,

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:26.260 align:middle line:84%
the table is covered
with people's hands.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in the restaurant
gets up from their table,

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.469 align:middle line:84%
comes and puts their
hands, even the waiter

00:23:30.469 --> 00:23:31.760 align:middle line:90%
comes over and puts his hands--

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you've had
10 minutes of instruction.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Right.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:35.260 align:middle line:90%
And it starts from there.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, you know, this
gift just started happening.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I spent many,
many years reading

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.850 align:middle line:84%
for anybody that would hold
their hands out for me.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:47.180 align:middle line:84%
I learned to read tea
leaves, coffee grinds, auras,

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:47.980 align:middle line:90%
tarot cards--

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's
really all the same.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:50.556 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: It's all the same.

00:23:50.556 --> 00:23:51.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful--

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a divination
tool for your own sight.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
you end up in Maui.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And you end up
meeting this character

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.610 align:middle line:90%
named Ra at some point.

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.230 align:middle line:84%
You were turned on to
his work in human design.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:05.450 align:middle line:90%
Let's pick that up.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: So, yes.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm living in Maui.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And this friend of mine who
lives in Taos, New Mexico,

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.465 align:middle line:90%
sends me a chart.

00:24:11.465 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And she says you're
going to want to see this

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.089 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's
going to be something

00:24:15.089 --> 00:24:16.230 align:middle line:90%
that's interesting for you.

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's my Human Design chart.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:19.690 align:middle line:84%
I take one look at
this chart and I

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:21.669 align:middle line:84%
know right away this
is what the shadow

00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:90%
reader had told me about.

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:24.430 align:middle line:90%
This was the system.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:25.610 align:middle line:90%
It was a new system.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.490 align:middle line:90%
It had been downloaded in 1987.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:31.430 align:middle line:84%
I'd had my reading
in India in 1979.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:84%
So 1987, the system comes in,
to this man who just apparently

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.250 align:middle line:90%
wasn't expecting it to happen.

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And he was making
this travel to America

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.080 align:middle line:84%
to come and introduce
it over here.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And my friend was going
to be hosting him.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.770 align:middle line:90%
And she sent me his chart.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And for the next seven
years, twice a year,

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I would fly from Maui to Taos to
go and join in with his classes

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.500 align:middle line:90%
whenever he came.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now this is a
very reluctant person.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:59.240 align:middle line:84%
This is not what he chose
for him, his own life.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.220 align:middle line:84%
I think it's fair to
say reluctant, if not,

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.970 align:middle line:90%
violently, reluctant at times.

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: He was put
upon is all I can say.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.670 align:middle line:84%
On some level, he
had made an agreement

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.610 align:middle line:90%
to download this system.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:84%
But he said he wasn't
given any kind of a choice.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.060 align:middle line:84%
For eight days and
nights he was bombarded

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.650 align:middle line:90%
with this information.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.190 align:middle line:84%
This was a highly
intelligent man, Ra,

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.940 align:middle line:90%
and high IQ and everything.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.990 align:middle line:90%
Very capable.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And he said the intelligence of
the entity that was giving him

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.760 align:middle line:84%
this information
made him feel like he

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.240 align:middle line:84%
was an ant, the height of the
intelligence of the information

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:90%
that was coming through.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:38.090 align:middle line:84%
At the end of eight
days and nights,

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.630 align:middle line:84%
somehow, he survived
the experience.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.850 align:middle line:90%
His nervous system was shot.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:43.730 align:middle line:90%
But slowly--

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was he writing and
drawing at the same time?

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.261 align:middle line:84%
His table was covered
with diagrams.

00:25:49.261 --> 00:25:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything
that was downloading.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Everything.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, all esoteric
systems were included

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:55.750 align:middle line:90%
in the original download.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: And The
unfortunate thing

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.072 align:middle line:84%
was he started sharing the
information with people.

00:26:02.072 --> 00:26:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And then arrived
at a point in time

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.600 align:middle line:84%
when he was very uncomfortable
with how people were perceiving

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.940 align:middle line:84%
him, like as a guru
or somebody that

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.750 align:middle line:90%
had this special knowledge.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And he basically destroyed all
the information he was given.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Burned it and went off and
lived in the hills for a year.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:22.211 align:middle line:84%
And finally, recovered
from this very--

00:26:22.211 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Shocking experience.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Indeed.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.600 align:middle line:90%
And fortunately came back.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.230 align:middle line:90%
Somebody had kept their chart.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.400 align:middle line:84%
They hadn't give it
to him to destroy.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And from that chart he
started rebuilding everything.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And there were parts
of Human Design

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:37.810 align:middle line:84%
that I guess have
been lost forever.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:41.320 align:middle line:84%
But there are other parts that
have been very, very clearly--

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.770 align:middle line:84%
he was able to remember
it and this original chart

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.920 align:middle line:84%
was able to show him
what he'd been given.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And when he came to America,
he was still very much in tune

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:52.180 align:middle line:84%
with the purity of
the information that

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.660 align:middle line:90%
had been given to him.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And in those early days,
we started exploring

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.350 align:middle line:90%
in the classes that he gave.

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:01.912 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How many people were
in that early wave of students?

00:27:01.912 --> 00:27:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: There were probably
a dozen people to start with.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And then it started
expanding, maybe 20.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:09.490 align:middle line:90%
I kept going.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And there just came
a point in time

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:14.600 align:middle line:84%
when all of a sudden I realized
what was now being interpreted

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.580 align:middle line:84%
in the information was
actually stretching away

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.950 align:middle line:84%
from the original purity
of what had come through.

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So I just started going
my own way with it.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it was a little
bit of a struggle at first,

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.320 align:middle line:84%
because there had built
up a community around him.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.540 align:middle line:84%
He started pulling
together entities

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.624 align:middle line:90%
to be the official Human Design.

00:27:32.624 --> 00:27:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
you're breaking away

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.280 align:middle line:84%
so you had to go on the
outside of that comfort zone.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yeah.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have interviewed
one other person, essentially,

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.160 align:middle line:84%
on this called The Gene
Codes which is Richard Rudd.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think you were
a teacher to him, initially?

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Or you exposed him to it?

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.320 align:middle line:90%
Or how did that go?

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Well he was living
on Maui and we were introduced.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:54.420 align:middle line:90%
And yes, I read for him.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.500 align:middle line:90%
I read for his wife.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
he was like you.

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:58.620 align:middle line:90%
He just said this is it.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yeah, he did.

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:00.130 align:middle line:90%
He got it right away.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:00.930 align:middle line:90%
He recognized it.

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.840 align:middle line:90%
We became firm friends.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.410 align:middle line:90%
And he went back to England.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And he got this very, very
potent download in 2004

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.740 align:middle line:84%
when the planet Venus
was doing that transit

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.320 align:middle line:84%
across the face of the
sun-- you might remember it.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And he downloaded
what he described

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:middle line:90%
as the Venus Sequence.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And from that came
The Gene Keys.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, he's
done wonderful work.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And you know when
I was first exposed

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:28.730 align:middle line:84%
to Human Design maybe 15, 16
years ago-- because I'm open.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm open minded.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.880 align:middle line:90%
I kind of check everything out.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:39.360 align:middle line:84%
But I found it to be the most
functionally useful system.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:44.280 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just explaining
what your traits are,

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.280 align:middle line:84%
your attributes, what you
brought in with this, where

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.180 align:middle line:84%
a challenge might lie,
how you express yourself,

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:53.130 align:middle line:90%
but ways in which to function.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Is that really kind of the
point of it to a large extent?

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: It is absolutely
a tool for these times.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.820 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
like Human Design.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge gift for humanity.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And basically, we've
got to realize,

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.539 align:middle line:84%
you know, foundationally
nobody knows what life is.

00:29:11.539 --> 00:29:13.080 align:middle line:84%
We're sitting here,
we're carrying on

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.390 align:middle line:84%
as though we do
know what life is.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:15.450 align:middle line:90%
But nobody really knows.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And you can ask Jesus, Buddha,
Mohammed, anybody, they don't

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:19.580 align:middle line:90%
really know what this thing is.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.960 align:middle line:84%
We're just having
this experience.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.160 align:middle line:90%
So we come into this world.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:28.760 align:middle line:84%
We come in as a clear, pure
being on a soul journey

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.420 align:middle line:84%
through life to have this
experience on planet Earth.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're born in a
particular family that

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.197 align:middle line:90%
has particular ways of living.

00:29:35.197 --> 00:29:36.780 align:middle line:84%
You know they're
either wealthy or not

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:40.220 align:middle line:84%
or they have these
preconditions of how they live.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.260 align:middle line:90%
They've got a religion perhaps.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:46.792 align:middle line:84%
They've got a society or a
group of friends around them.

00:29:46.792 --> 00:29:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And then we get
trammelled off to school.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And we get told history about
everybody else and nothing

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.070 align:middle line:90%
about ourselves.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And we get layers and layers
and layers of conditioning

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.750 align:middle line:90%
put on top of us.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else's ideas of what
might be appropriate or not,

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.850 align:middle line:90%
and so-and-so did this.

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:04.610 align:middle line:90%
And we get completely befuddled.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:06.540 align:middle line:84%
The very last thing
we're instructed to do

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.020 align:middle line:84%
is be true to our own nature,
this pure all wonderful

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.700 align:middle line:90%
essence.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.620 align:middle line:84%
So Human Design basically
gives you a blueprint.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:17.990 align:middle line:84%
It gives you the operator's
manual for your own life.

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I say
it's such a huge gift.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Because there you
are in this chart,

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:28.580 align:middle line:84%
you can see exactly the design
that you come in to play out.

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:29.380 align:middle line:90%
And let's face it.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.750 align:middle line:84%
In this universe,
universe is very generous.

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.660 align:middle line:90%
There are no duplicates.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:37.040 align:middle line:84%
No grains of sand in the
whole planet are the same.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So no people are
living the same life.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you've never
seen identical charts?

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes.

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:43.970 align:middle line:84%
On the face of things,
I see identical charts.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:46.360 align:middle line:84%
But you know there are
layers and layers and layers.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, yes, I get
to see between these layers.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:54.590 align:middle line:84%
So I've read for twins
born minutes apart.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And on the face of things,
they have the same chart,

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.060 align:middle line:84%
but when I read for them they
get their own very particular

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:00.861 align:middle line:90%
experience of it.

00:31:00.861 --> 00:31:02.276 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well
when you first came

00:31:02.276 --> 00:31:04.366 align:middle line:84%
into the studio, or in
the makeup room, and all

00:31:04.366 --> 00:31:08.930 align:middle line:84%
that-- not that you
needed any makeup-- we

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:11.020 align:middle line:84%
had a couple of
different people ask

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.284 align:middle line:90%
about their particular chart.

00:31:12.284 --> 00:31:13.950 align:middle line:84%
One of them I gave
the heads up and said

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:15.465 align:middle line:84%
print one out before
it shuts down,

00:31:15.465 --> 00:31:16.690 align:middle line:90%
so you can be meet Chetan.

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:18.070 align:middle line:90%
And you zeroed right in.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean instantly,
right to the heart

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:22.360 align:middle line:84%
of the life, the heart
of the purpose, exactly

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:26.060 align:middle line:84%
what that person's doing, even
attempting to doing further.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
again on another chart.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:28.840 align:middle line:90%
This is who you are.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:29.890 align:middle line:90%
You live for spirit.

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:31.000 align:middle line:90%
You are this.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's so quick.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:35.470 align:middle line:90%
It's so direct.

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's such
a mirror for someone

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:41.280 align:middle line:84%
to be able to hold a
vision of themselves

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.844 align:middle line:90%
that they couldn't see.

00:31:42.844 --> 00:31:43.760 align:middle line:90%
They may have felt it.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.620 align:middle line:90%
They may being experiencing it.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.950 align:middle line:90%
But they can't see it.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Right So having
this reading at the age of 27

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.390 align:middle line:84%
in India and being just
told your whole life

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:56.920 align:middle line:84%
is turning into
something different.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's not what
you're thinking it is.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And just having that sensation,
oh, I can look outside the box

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:07.560 align:middle line:84%
here and be able to provide
that for people in their lives

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.930 align:middle line:90%
in this time, it's like yes.

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:12.900 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
follow everybody else.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.700 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go along with
everybody else's rules systems.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.640 align:middle line:84%
You are here to be you,
a perfect expression

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.270 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness in human form.

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you had your
first Human Design reading,

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:25.980 align:middle line:84%
you saw the chart and had
the first explanation,

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.570 align:middle line:90%
did it have that effect on you?

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:29.070 align:middle line:90%
Did it see you?

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:31.122 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes.

00:32:31.122 --> 00:32:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I suppose
or you wouldn't

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.290 align:middle line:84%
have recognized instantly
that this was the system.

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:37.772 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: It just shows
all your strengths.

00:32:37.772 --> 00:32:40.230 align:middle line:84%
It shows all the areas where
you're going to be challenged.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:42.970 align:middle line:84%
It shows where you get to
play in this lifetime, where

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:44.834 align:middle line:84%
you interact best
with other people.

00:32:44.834 --> 00:32:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Who are the people you're
going to get on well with?

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Who are the ones that are really
going to understand you best?

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.130 align:middle line:84%
But it really is your
own operator's manual,

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:54.830 align:middle line:90%
your perfect design.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at a chart, it has

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:59.920 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of a tree
of life quality to it.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.449 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: It's got all kinds
of wonderful fastens in it.

00:33:02.449 --> 00:33:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It has I Ching.

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:04.990 align:middle line:84%
It has everything
loaded in there.

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: It's like a cake mix.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.980 align:middle line:84%
You put all kinds of
different ingredients

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.140 align:middle line:84%
like the I Ching, astrology,
Qabalah, chakra system,

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:17.600 align:middle line:84%
mix it in with a little bit of
genetics and neutrino physics.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Mix it up and cook it
and there's your cake.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And you've got something
that's revolutionary.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:24.557 align:middle line:84%
So when one's
looking at a chart--

00:33:24.557 --> 00:33:26.056 align:middle line:84%
and we'll take a
look at one-- we'll

00:33:26.056 --> 00:33:28.130 align:middle line:84%
let the viewers look at
this chart right now.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Just as in a chart.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.380 align:middle line:84%
You'll see that some centers
have colors and are filled

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.830 align:middle line:90%
in with triangles or squares.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And some of them have little
colored pathways between them.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And other things
are completely open.

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:41.380 align:middle line:90%
It's just there's nothing there.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Explain what that means to have
a center that is filled in,

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:49.330 align:middle line:84%
colored/defined
versus undefined.

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: OK.

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Well let's be clear
before we get in here.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:56.120 align:middle line:84%
There is no such thing as a
good chart or a bad chart.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Because in this time of reading
for people, all kinds of people

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:00.880 align:middle line:84%
said, oh, I don't want to
hear anything about myself.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.520 align:middle line:84%
You'll tell me
something dreadful.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's absolutely not
the case with Human Design.

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:08.860 align:middle line:84%
This is a clear
reflection of who you are.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.610 align:middle line:10%
So when you see, on the chart,
that one of these centers--

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:15.310 align:middle line:10%
there are nine of these
centers-- when it's colored in,

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:19.020 align:middle line:10%
it means it's turned on and
operating 24 hours a day.

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.810 align:middle line:10%
And it's turned on
to operate according

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:25.050 align:middle line:10%
to the particular connection
it has to another center.

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So all the centers have various
ways in which they can connect.

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, if we're
talking about the mind,

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:33.530 align:middle line:84%
we could say there's a logical
way of thinking about stuff

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:36.159 align:middle line:84%
and there's an illogical
way of thinking about stuff.

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:36.959 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:34:36.959 --> 00:34:38.940 align:middle line:84%
There's science and
there's a belief systems.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:40.814 align:middle line:84%
So depending on the
connection that you

00:34:40.814 --> 00:34:44.650 align:middle line:84%
might have into the mind
center in your chart,

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:47.449 align:middle line:84%
that will show you
your way in which

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:50.350 align:middle line:90%
you access mental strategies.

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:53.484 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, for example,
you and I have similar charts.

00:34:53.484 --> 00:34:55.900 align:middle line:84%
There were similar typology
which we'll go to in a moment.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:59.070 align:middle line:84%
But we have one where the
triangle on the forehead

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.910 align:middle line:84%
is connected to the
one in the throat.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:02.820 align:middle line:90%
And that pathway's filled in.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.550 align:middle line:84%
So explain what that would
mean, for example, to someone.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: OK.

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:11.020 align:middle line:84%
So colored in center, the mind
center, we color in green.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.260 align:middle line:84%
This is our thinking
process, our biocomputer.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.122 align:middle line:84%
The fact that it's colored
in means it's operating 24/7.

00:35:17.122 --> 00:35:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the mind's
eye always going.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Always going.

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:21.303 align:middle line:84%
You probably have noticed
that in your life.

00:35:21.303 --> 00:35:22.160 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't stop.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:24.680 align:middle line:84%
My ex-husband said do
you ever stop thinking?

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Nope.

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:29.279 align:middle line:84%
And so how do you get into
a place of meditation?

00:35:29.279 --> 00:35:30.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, if the
mind's going to keep

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.361 align:middle line:84%
on rattling away, and telling
you look at this, look at that,

00:35:33.361 --> 00:35:34.554 align:middle line:90%
look at the other.

00:35:34.554 --> 00:35:36.220 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can
get into meditation

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.385 align:middle line:84%
is through
transcending your mind.

00:35:38.385 --> 00:35:40.760 align:middle line:84%
You're just going to say thank
you very much for sharing.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.324 align:middle line:84%
Right now I'm not going to
be paying attention to you.

00:35:43.324 --> 00:35:44.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, think
anything you want.

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:45.540 align:middle line:90%
I'll be back.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And so now you
have it connected.

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And so to look at the
relational part of

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.430 align:middle line:84%
say what this connection
would mean to the throat.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Your thoughts
are expressed according

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.757 align:middle line:90%
to this particular channel.

00:35:57.757 --> 00:35:59.590 align:middle line:84%
So there are three
channels between the mind

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:00.230 align:middle line:90%
and the throat.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:01.813 align:middle line:84%
You've got the one
in the middle which

00:36:01.813 --> 00:36:04.250 align:middle line:84%
is one that's always
expressing insight.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.430 align:middle line:84%
So you get an insight,
you express it.

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
a logical thing.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
an illogical thing.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like this is what
my mind is telling me,

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:14.634 align:middle line:84%
this is what I know,
take it or leave it.

00:36:14.634 --> 00:36:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you express it.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's the relational
aspect of say those two.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Now let's say that you have the
heart center that is filled in.

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:25.730 align:middle line:90%
Now which one is the heart?

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: It's the
little triangle center.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.230 align:middle line:90%
The little red triangle center.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Little
red triangle center.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And let's say what would the
heart be next to and often

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:34.980 align:middle line:90%
connected to, for example?

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.520 align:middle line:90%
And how would that appear?

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: The heart center
has four possible connections.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking
statistics, most people

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:43.750 align:middle line:90%
don't have it colored in.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: It's just statistics.

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:47.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's undefined.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:48.711 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: It's undefined.

00:36:48.711 --> 00:36:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But why
is that in humanity

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:55.700 align:middle line:84%
that the heart would be
undefined and not on 24/7?

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.129 align:middle line:84%
In the majority
of the population?

00:36:57.129 --> 00:36:58.420 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Well, let's just say.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.290 align:middle line:84%
We're reading this in
terms of the energy of it,

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:02.840 align:middle line:90%
what the heart stands for.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And it starts from
our value systems.

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:05.760 align:middle line:90%
That's what it stands for.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Value systems.

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:08.640 align:middle line:90%
What do we give value to?

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.280 align:middle line:84%
In our heart of hearts,
what do we want out of life?

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that most people
have it colored in white

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and not defined, not
consistent, means

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.000 align:middle line:84%
that on a consistent
basis, they don't really

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.530 align:middle line:90%
know what they want.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, interesting.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: So don't make
a problem out of it.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.487 align:middle line:84%
Just say oh well,
life's offering me

00:37:26.487 --> 00:37:27.320 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of things.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Sooner or later I'll
find out what it is

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.550 align:middle line:90%
that really has value for me.

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:32.230 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime
I don't need to copy

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:35.200 align:middle line:84%
everybody else with what their
sense of values might be.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.134 align:middle line:84%
So you're still open also
to embracing the new.

00:37:38.134 --> 00:37:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: You can
start becoming--

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.290 align:middle line:84%
the thing with the
white centers is

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:44.370 align:middle line:84%
they're not fixed to operate
in any particular way.

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:47.760 align:middle line:84%
They can accrue wisdom
over time of, particularly

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.540 align:middle line:84%
the heart center, of what it
is that really does hold value.

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Now that let's do this.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So we'll let people look
at this on the screen.

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:57.520 align:middle line:90%
We'll start from the very top.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And then tell us the name
of it and its function.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And you can give the
color to it, too,

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:04.840 align:middle line:84%
just so everyone knows
we're all together here.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And on each of the nine centers,
just a really quick tour

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.010 align:middle line:84%
through the nine centers
and what they mean.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:09.843 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: All right.

00:38:09.843 --> 00:38:10.820 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:11.970 align:middle line:90%
So nine centers.

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:12.770 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.200 align:middle line:84%
If we're talking
chakra systems, we're

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.450 align:middle line:90%
talking perhaps seven centers.

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:18.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's just say the
human condition has evolved

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.419 align:middle line:90%
to have nine centers now.

00:38:20.419 --> 00:38:22.210 align:middle line:84%
The one right at the
top, the crown center,

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:23.420 align:middle line:90%
it's unique in the chart.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.430 align:middle line:84%
It only connects to one other
center, that's the mine center.

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's shown as partly
in the body and partly out

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:30.910 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:32.000 align:middle line:90%
It's up here somewhere.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a source of inspiration,
relates to the pituitary gland.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:38.420 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.690 align:middle line:90%
And so we download inspiration.

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And this crown center
processes that inspiration

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.860 align:middle line:84%
or holds that possibility
for inspiration.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.370 align:middle line:84%
To be inspired by what's
this, what's that.

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Does this make sense?

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:53.270 align:middle line:90%
Does this fit the picture?

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:56.559 align:middle line:84%
The mind center beneath
it is colored in green.

00:38:56.559 --> 00:38:58.350 align:middle line:84%
The crown center would
be colored in yellow

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:00.960 align:middle line:90%
if it's turned on 24/7.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.430 align:middle line:84%
The green mind center, that you
and I both have in our designs,

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:05.930 align:middle line:90%
we're always thinking.

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And there are these different
ways in which we think.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:12.110 align:middle line:90%
And this is the pineal gland.

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:14.677 align:middle line:90%
So we're processing stuff.

00:39:14.677 --> 00:39:16.260 align:middle line:84%
We might call it the
third eye center.

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.532 align:middle line:90%
We might see it in that way.

00:39:18.532 --> 00:39:20.240 align:middle line:84%
There are connections
to the throat where

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.300 align:middle line:84%
we get to express what it
is that's been going on

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:23.110 align:middle line:90%
in our mind.

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And the throat center has a
brown color if it's colored in,

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:27.060 align:middle line:90%
if it's defined.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's the most complex
of all the centers.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.820 align:middle line:84%
It's the thyroid and
parathyroid glands.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.550 align:middle line:84%
It's where we get to
express ourselves in life,

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:36.540 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through
the words that we use

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:39.960 align:middle line:84%
or whether the actions
that we play out.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Down beneath the throat
center is a diamond center

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.830 align:middle line:90%
in the middle.

00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:45.920 align:middle line:84%
If it's defined, it's
colored in yellow.

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
self center, relates

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:50.100 align:middle line:84%
to the liver, the filtration
system in the body,

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:50.930 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us our sense
of direction, purpose,

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.954 align:middle line:90%
connectedness, and love in life.

00:39:56.954 --> 00:39:58.370 align:middle line:84%
So if it's defined,
it's something

00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:59.661 align:middle line:90%
that's always available to you.

00:39:59.661 --> 00:40:02.680 align:middle line:84%
You're consistent in who you
are and how you play things out.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now is that
sometimes referred to

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:06.114 align:middle line:90%
as the egoic center?

00:40:06.114 --> 00:40:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Not so much.

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.947 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not so much.

00:40:07.947 --> 00:40:08.746 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:08.746 --> 00:40:10.125 align:middle line:90%
So it's just defined as self.

00:40:10.125 --> 00:40:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Self.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.080 align:middle line:90%
identity in a sense.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Self identity.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.250 align:middle line:90%
OK good.

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.458 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: So those that have
it colored in, they have

00:40:17.458 --> 00:40:19.520 align:middle line:90%
a consistency in who they are.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.200 align:middle line:10%
Those like myself,
and yourself, we

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.100 align:middle line:10%
have it colored in white
where basically we're

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.780 align:middle line:10%
constantly changing who we are.

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just tell
someone to tell me.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.072 align:middle line:84%
It's like I need a
mirror to figure it out.

00:40:31.072 --> 00:40:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: It's a
fascinating thing.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:33.772 align:middle line:90%
You go to a party.

00:40:33.772 --> 00:40:35.230 align:middle line:84%
You stand with one
group of friends

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.320 align:middle line:90%
on one side of the room.

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.960 align:middle line:84%
That is who you are while
you're in that group.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: You are reflecting
that group back to itself.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's like a chameleon.

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.237 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Exactly.

00:40:42.237 --> 00:40:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And then you go and
join another group

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:45.180 align:middle line:84%
and that's who you
are in that group,

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.680 align:middle line:84%
according to the connections
that other people give you,

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.720 align:middle line:84%
or what it is that
defines the present--

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Verses
that consistency

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.970 align:middle line:84%
that you are what you are
no matter what circumstance.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: So what I say
about the white centers,

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.830 align:middle line:90%
they're where we get to play.

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:01.890 align:middle line:84%
We play in the energy
fields of other people.

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:03.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's a great play.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.950 align:middle line:84%
But the whole thing
is don't hang on

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:07.830 align:middle line:84%
to any particular characteristic
that somebody else

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:09.369 align:middle line:90%
might have in that center.

00:41:09.369 --> 00:41:10.910 align:middle line:84%
It's just while
they're there, you're

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:12.810 align:middle line:84%
accruing the wisdom
perhaps of what it is--

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:14.352 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not who you are.

00:41:14.352 --> 00:41:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: It's not
the consistency.

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:17.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same with
any of these centers.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:19.590 align:middle line:84%
An undefined mind, you're
processing other people

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:20.472 align:middle line:90%
thought patterns.

00:41:20.472 --> 00:41:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And undefined throat, you're
saying things for other people

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:24.770 align:middle line:90%
they can't say for themselves.

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:26.900 align:middle line:90%
These are good distinctions.

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So we've come to the center
of identity or self, yellow.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:31.420 align:middle line:90%
And then where do we go?

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:32.690 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKYN: Then we go to the
little triangle center--

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.670 align:middle line:10%
the heart center we were
just talking about-- what

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:35.340 align:middle line:10%
we want out of life.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:36.530 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And that's red?

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:38.215 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: If it's
defined, it's red.

00:41:38.215 --> 00:41:39.590 align:middle line:84%
So if you have it
defined, you'll

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:41.500 align:middle line:84%
see that you've got
this will power.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.360 align:middle line:90%
You can make things happen.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:47.780 align:middle line:84%
You know you've got this drive,
this push, to make things work.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:48.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's very efficient.

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:53.004 align:middle line:84%
Let's just get it done, get
it complete, and on we go.

00:41:53.004 --> 00:41:54.420 align:middle line:84%
But the difficulty
here comes when

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:56.070 align:middle line:84%
people have their
center colored white

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:58.420 align:middle line:84%
and they insist on trying
to use willpower that they

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:01.060 align:middle line:90%
don't have consistent access.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So then they start
straining their heart

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.430 align:middle line:84%
or getting a whole
bunch of stuff

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:08.010 align:middle line:84%
in their life they don't
want and they don't need.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:11.100 align:middle line:84%
But you know it
just somehow it--

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How does
a person manifest

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.800 align:middle line:84%
what they desire if they
don't have that filled in

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.720 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
the natural will power?

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.095 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Well that's part of
the beauty of Human Design.

00:42:20.095 --> 00:42:21.580 align:middle line:84%
We all have our
operators manual.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:25.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we're not given
an ignition key here, right?

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has their unique
way of engaging in life.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So the great thing
is to see there

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:33.480 align:middle line:84%
are no good charts, no bad
charts, no good centers,

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.860 align:middle line:90%
no bad centers.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.780 align:middle line:84%
If you have the heart
center colored in,

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:38.815 align:middle line:84%
you have this consistency
and willpower.

00:42:38.815 --> 00:42:40.190 align:middle line:84%
If you have it
colored white, you

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:42.080 align:middle line:84%
are here to be wise
about the nature of what

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.430 align:middle line:90%
it is in life that holds value.

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Now what's the next center?

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: You go to the
left side of the chart,

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.110 align:middle line:90%
we have the spleen center.

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:50.910 align:middle line:84%
The triangle center
that's on it's side.

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:53.790 align:middle line:84%
The spleen center relates
to our immune system, health

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:54.730 align:middle line:90%
and well-being.

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:58.160 align:middle line:84%
It's like the washing machine
in the body, the lymph system.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And it has its own
very particular way

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.430 align:middle line:90%
of keeping the body healthy.

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.460 align:middle line:84%
The immune system's
quite a scene

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.850 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how it deals with
bacteria and viruses and stuff.

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:09.280 align:middle line:84%
So if you got it colored
in, colored brown,

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.170 align:middle line:90%
it's turned on 24/7.

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:13.110 align:middle line:84%
You bring this sense of
well-being and health

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:14.770 align:middle line:90%
wherever you go.

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:16.990 align:middle line:84%
For people that have
it colored in white,

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:21.050 align:middle line:84%
you're susceptible to picking
up other people's discomfort,

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:22.000 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And the great thing is to
be very clear about that.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.660 align:middle line:84%
You can be very
good at diagnosing

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.600 align:middle line:84%
other people's
sense of well-being

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.781 align:middle line:90%
with an undefined spleen center.

00:43:30.781 --> 00:43:32.280 align:middle line:84%
With a defined
spleen center, you're

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.760 align:middle line:84%
here helping everybody
else feel fit and well.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But again, there
can come a point

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.540 align:middle line:90%
where you over commit yourself.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you do get
sick, there's a chance

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.040 align:middle line:90%
of getting really sick.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:48.410 align:middle line:84%
So the spleen center survival,
it has a fear issue around it.

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:51.100 align:middle line:84%
What does the body need
to do to protect itself?

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:55.597 align:middle line:84%
So people can get very
easily stuck in fears.

00:43:55.597 --> 00:43:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you've gotten this
center colored in white,

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.510 align:middle line:84%
recognize you're running
somebody else's fear patterns.

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So from the spleen
center, where do we go?

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.580 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKYN: So from
the spleen center,

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:06.205 align:middle line:10%
we go across to the
middle of the chart

00:44:06.205 --> 00:44:09.050 align:middle line:10%
and the second one up from the
bottom is the sacred center.

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:12.200 align:middle line:10%
And this is the sex center, the
center of life force energy.

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And with Human Design, we
call it the generator center.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:17.140 align:middle line:84%
If it's defined,
it's colored red.

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:19.450 align:middle line:90%
If it's not, it's colored white.

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:21.945 align:middle line:84%
Most people-- we're
talking nearly 70%

00:44:21.945 --> 00:44:24.320 align:middle line:84%
of the world's population--
have their center colored in,

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.800 align:middle line:90%
defined.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.840 align:middle line:84%
So most people fall
into type that we

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:32.550 align:middle line:84%
call generator or
manifesting generator,

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:33.759 align:middle line:90%
because they have this trem--

00:44:33.759 --> 00:44:35.883 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that one of
the marks of the generator

00:44:35.883 --> 00:44:36.880 align:middle line:90%
is that's filled in?

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:38.005 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: That is the mark.

00:44:38.005 --> 00:44:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the mark.

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: The mark.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the rest
of the population

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.654 align:middle line:84%
with the white center, they're
not generators, obviously.

00:44:43.654 --> 00:44:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: They're not
generators or manifestors.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:48.285 align:middle line:84%
So if that center
is colored in, you

00:44:48.285 --> 00:44:52.220 align:middle line:84%
are somebody who is generating
life force energy 24 hours

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:53.330 align:middle line:90%
a day.

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:54.130 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:54.730 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing thing.

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a lot of energy.

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: It's a lot of energy.

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And you know the foundational
law of the universe?

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:00.460 align:middle line:90%
Life begets more life.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: So this sacral
center is constantly

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:07.080 align:middle line:84%
looking for ways in which to
propel this life force out

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.010 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:09.593 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So these
are the people that

00:45:09.593 --> 00:45:11.320 align:middle line:90%
have the energy to go and do.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Well yes.

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To a large extent.

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.691 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get to
that in a little bit.

00:45:14.691 --> 00:45:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: But they've never been
told how to use this energy.

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.195 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We'll wait.

00:45:18.195 --> 00:45:20.280 align:middle line:84%
We'll finish the centers
then go to the typology.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:20.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's go over, I guess
to the right from there?

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yeah.

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.820 align:middle line:84%
But let's just say
no good or bad you.

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:26.319 align:middle line:84%
You know, if it's
colored in, great.

00:45:26.319 --> 00:45:28.430 align:middle line:10%
If it's not colored in,
it's also fantastic.

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:30.100 align:middle line:10%
You've got your
own way of living.

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:30.340 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're lacking
in energy in some way or other.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:33.340 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.940 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKYN: To the right side,
we have the emotional center,

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.920 align:middle line:10%
the solar plexus center.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Energetically,
this is two inches

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.590 align:middle line:84%
below the navel, a
little bit on the inside.

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is almost like
the center of gravity

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:47.560 align:middle line:90%
for humanity, the emotions.

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:50.200 align:middle line:84%
I would say this is a major
reason Human Design actually

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.990 align:middle line:84%
came to the planet at this
time, because as human beings,

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:56.120 align:middle line:84%
we have not understood
our emotions very well.

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are most
people, percentage wise,

00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:00.285 align:middle line:90%
emotionally defined?

00:46:00.285 --> 00:46:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Inevitably,
if they're not defined,

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.700 align:middle line:84%
they'll get in a
relationship with somebody

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.575 align:middle line:84%
and they will be defined
in that partnership.

00:46:05.575 --> 00:46:08.930 align:middle line:84%
OK So everybody needs to
understand about this emotion

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:10.020 align:middle line:90%
center.

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Emotions run in a
wave, up everything's

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:17.610 align:middle line:84%
fabulous, down everything's
not so fabulous.

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:19.974 align:middle line:84%
Oh, hang on, I'm feeling
great again, oh no,

00:46:19.974 --> 00:46:21.140 align:middle line:90%
not feeling so good anymore.

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:22.515 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
is very typical

00:46:22.515 --> 00:46:24.600 align:middle line:84%
if you're defined in the
emotions in particular?

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes, in particular.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:30.390 align:middle line:84%
However everybody gets
caught up in emotion.

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:33.120 align:middle line:84%
The moment we understand about
emotion, or as I say we're

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:36.320 align:middle line:84%
in this Aquarian age now, where
war is a thing of the past.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.470 align:middle line:84%
The violence and all that
stuff, it's got to go.

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:39.270 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not constructive,
it's not creative anymore.

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:45.220 align:middle line:84%
So we all have to understand
the nature of emotion.

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And the thing of it is
if you're high as a kite

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:49.110 align:middle line:84%
and you're having
a wonderful day,

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:50.532 align:middle line:84%
there aren't any
problems for you.

00:46:50.532 --> 00:46:52.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you're at the bottom
of your wave and somebody

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:56.015 align:middle line:84%
says something to trigger
you, then there's an argument.

00:46:56.015 --> 00:46:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Then there's a fight.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And then there's all
kinds of unpleasantness.

00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or they
put you on lithium

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:00.893 align:middle line:90%
because you're manic depressive.

00:47:00.893 --> 00:47:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: There's that, too.

00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:04.230 align:middle line:84%
So to understand about
the emotion center,

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:05.710 align:middle line:90%
it's the pleasure.

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:07.940 align:middle line:90%
It's also the pain center.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.070 align:middle line:90%
It's the center of addictions.

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:11.830 align:middle line:90%
I just want to stay up.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:13.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go down.

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:14.270 align:middle line:90%
I just want to stay up.

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And so very, very
important for people

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.300 align:middle line:84%
that have this center
colored in to understand they

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.320 align:middle line:90%
have both ends of the wave.

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And they have to acknowledge
and honor both ends of the wave.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And part of the owner's manual,
which we'll perhaps talk about,

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:33.730 align:middle line:84%
is the authority is how to
make decisions emotionally.

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Very, very important
thing to understand.

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.930 align:middle line:10%
Undefined emotions?

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:39.930 align:middle line:10%
You're very susceptible to
other people's emotions.

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:41.704 align:middle line:90%
I've experienced that.

00:47:41.704 --> 00:47:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Don't buy into it.

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, I mean,
I am emotionally defined,

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:46.860 align:middle line:84%
but I watch how
whatever I'm feeling

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.295 align:middle line:84%
is being projected through
someone who's not defined.

00:47:49.295 --> 00:47:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: They
have their own way

00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:52.586 align:middle line:84%
of deciding whether they
want to have anything

00:47:52.586 --> 00:47:56.260 align:middle line:84%
to do with you when you're
running your emotions or not.

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And they have to honor
that truth in themself.

00:47:58.820 --> 00:47:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And so that will
come under authority.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Right

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, what's
the remaining center?

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.408 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKYN: The root center
at the bottom of the chart.

00:48:05.408 --> 00:48:06.900 align:middle line:10%
And this relates
to the adrenals.

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And the adrenals used to
be our escape mechanism.

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.820 align:middle line:84%
You know there's a
danger, run for your life.

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And these days it's more about
survival in the 21st century.

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.960 align:middle line:84%
So the root center is all about
the pressure, the pressure

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.910 align:middle line:90%
to engage in life.

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:22.380 align:middle line:84%
It has connections
to the spleen.

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:23.980 align:middle line:84%
It has connections
to the sacral.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.110 align:middle line:84%
It has connections to
the emotion center.

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:28.230 align:middle line:90%
It is just a pressure.

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:29.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you have it
colored in, you're

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:33.500 align:middle line:84%
somebody who is always operating
under a certain pressure

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.340 align:middle line:84%
to commit yourself one
way or another in life.

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.570 align:middle line:10%
If you have it
undefined, same as

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:40.450 align:middle line:10%
with any of the other
undefined centers,

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:44.340 align:middle line:10%
you are susceptible to
other people's pressures.

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:47.740 align:middle line:84%
So in life, especially
in the 21st century,

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:50.390 align:middle line:84%
pressure is kind
of a normal thing.

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:53.720 align:middle line:84%
But there comes a point where
pressure moves into stress.

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you're running
stress, the chances

00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:58.780 align:middle line:84%
are you're running
according to somebody else's

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.040 align:middle line:90%
input in your life.

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.800 align:middle line:84%
OK You're either
going on their timing,

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:05.190 align:middle line:84%
their way of doing something,
and to be very, very

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:06.380 align:middle line:90%
clear about that.

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:07.213 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:49:07.213 --> 00:49:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll get to the types,
the five types, and then

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.610 align:middle line:90%
the notion of authority.

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: OK.

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So what we found
in Human Design is

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:18.940 align:middle line:84%
through the combinations of
centers that are colored in,

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:24.560 align:middle line:84%
or not colored in, there are
five distinct energy types.

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.320 align:middle line:84%
What we look to the
majority of people,

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:31.001 align:middle line:84%
they either have a generator or
a manifesting generator design.

00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:33.500 align:middle line:10%
That means they have that red
sacral center-- the second one

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:35.385 align:middle line:10%
up from the bottom of
the chart colored in.

00:49:35.385 --> 00:49:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
well of energy to do.

00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: The life
force energy, yes.

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:41.170 align:middle line:84%
What am I going to
do with this energy?

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:43.545 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe a lot of
times like physical activity

00:49:43.545 --> 00:49:45.130 align:middle line:84%
and that sort of
thing, working out?

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:46.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's more natural.

00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes.

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:49.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's a generator energy.

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:51.050 align:middle line:90%
It gets them a momentum.

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:52.670 align:middle line:90%
It builds up a momentum.

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And once momentum
is built up, it's

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:56.430 align:middle line:90%
very, very hard to stop it.

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So generators and
manifesting generators,

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:00.389 align:middle line:90%
they hate trying to quit.

00:50:00.389 --> 00:50:02.430 align:middle line:84%
They've got to be clear
at the outset of anything

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:04.810 align:middle line:90%
they get involved in.

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:07.820 align:middle line:84%
So there's no off
switch, basically.

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:10.025 align:middle line:84%
But most generators and
manifesting generators

00:50:10.025 --> 00:50:12.470 align:middle line:84%
just have never been told
how to use this energy.

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:16.116 align:middle line:84%
What's inside them tells them
to get involved with something.

00:50:16.116 --> 00:50:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe you can explain
that because a lot of get

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:19.290 align:middle line:90%
burnt out.

00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Indeed they do.

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.950 align:middle line:84%
They have what we
call a gut response.

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:26.090 align:middle line:90%
And it's a pure, gut response.

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:27.350 align:middle line:90%
It's not a mental process.

00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:29.116 align:middle line:90%
It's not philosophical.

00:50:29.116 --> 00:50:30.490 align:middle line:84%
There's no guilt
trips around it.

00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:34.026 align:middle line:90%
It's just interested, not now.

00:50:34.026 --> 00:50:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh, un-uh.

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.300 align:middle line:90%
It's as simple as that.

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.624 align:middle line:90%
That is a gut response.

00:50:38.624 --> 00:50:40.792 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh, you've got my attention.

00:50:40.792 --> 00:50:42.470 align:middle line:90%
Un-uh, not now.

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:44.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what it is.

00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:46.460 align:middle line:84%
You can offer me the
universe, not now.

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:49.230 align:middle line:84%
Come back next week, ask
me again some other time.

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So asking.

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:53.340 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the process
that works well for them right?

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.659 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They see
their answer when

00:50:55.659 --> 00:50:57.090 align:middle line:90%
it comes out of their mouth.

00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:59.006 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Well it can
come out of their mouth,

00:50:59.006 --> 00:51:02.600 align:middle line:84%
but more it's going to
be an energetic response.

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So generators and
manifesting generators,

00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:07.000 align:middle line:84%
they're always
looking for situations

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.220 align:middle line:84%
where people, particularly,
will come and ask you

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:10.195 align:middle line:90%
want to do this?

00:51:10.195 --> 00:51:11.537 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh, well apparently I do.

00:51:11.537 --> 00:51:12.495 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to do that?

00:51:12.495 --> 00:51:13.295 align:middle line:90%
Mmm.

00:51:13.295 --> 00:51:14.110 align:middle line:90%
Not now.

00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:16.292 align:middle line:90%
And it's as simple as that.

00:51:16.292 --> 00:51:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And honor it.

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: And honor it, yes.

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:20.270 align:middle line:90%
That is the important thing.

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:23.440 align:middle line:84%
If it's not now, it's
not happening now.

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.524 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Otherwise
you risk depletion.

00:51:25.524 --> 00:51:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Immediately.

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most generators,
they'll find themselves

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:30.040 align:middle line:90%
they have certain good days.

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.610 align:middle line:84%
But generally
speaking, they come

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:33.500 align:middle line:84%
to a state of exhaustion
and frustration,

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:35.430 align:middle line:84%
because all this
wonderful energy

00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:38.830 align:middle line:84%
is being put towards things that
don't bring them fulfillment.

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's generator,
manifesting generator.

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go to the next
which is projectors.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Projector, about
20% of the world's population.

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.930 align:middle line:90%
You and I are both projectors.

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Projectors, we're
naturally guides.

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.344 align:middle line:84%
We help people to
align their energies

00:51:53.344 --> 00:51:55.510 align:middle line:84%
in ways that are really
going to work well for them.

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:56.380 align:middle line:90%
We give information.

00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:58.180 align:middle line:90%
We help people come together.

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.170 align:middle line:90%
We help direct.

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're non-energy
types for the most part.

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:05.490 align:middle line:84%
We don't have this
life force energy,

00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:08.570 align:middle line:84%
the same sustained energy that
generators and manifesting

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:09.690 align:middle line:90%
generators have.

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:11.750 align:middle line:90%
It's just different like that

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So the difficulty
for a projector

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:16.820 align:middle line:84%
is the majority of
people have this energy,

00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and we think why shouldn't I
join in with everybody else?

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Shouldn't I just jump in there?

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And what we find
is we jump in there

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and we very quickly
run out of energy.

00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Or we find that
well, actually, this

00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:29.460 align:middle line:90%
is not the right place for you.

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And so we kind of withdraw and
say oh, what's wrong with me.

00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And how come I just
don't fit in there?

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about
for projectors

00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:40.360 align:middle line:84%
to recognize the very specific
nature of our own design--

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.390 align:middle line:84%
which is all very clear in
the Human Design chart--

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:45.827 align:middle line:84%
and to live according
to that, and to not

00:52:45.827 --> 00:52:47.660 align:middle line:84%
feel like we have to
join in with everything

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:51.980 align:middle line:84%
but be prepared to be
invited into things.

00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:54.695 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Invited in is
a key one for projectors.

00:52:54.695 --> 00:52:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Invited because we're
being recognized for who we are

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.580 align:middle line:90%
and what we can contribute.

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
one of the areas

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:06.870 align:middle line:84%
that when I had my very first
reading by Carolyn Ford years

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:09.770 align:middle line:84%
ago, she said you have
to wait to be invited.

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:14.084 align:middle line:84%
And I thought oh, god, I wish
I had known that 20 years ago.

00:53:14.084 --> 00:53:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Because every time I tried
to make something happen,

00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:19.980 align:middle line:84%
to beat on a door, or
make something happen,

00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:21.910 align:middle line:90%
it inevitably failed.

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:26.220 align:middle line:84%
But if I just dreamt my
dreams, a call would happen.

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.484 align:middle line:90%
And I'd be invited.

00:53:27.484 --> 00:53:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And everything I wanted
and more would happen.

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.580 align:middle line:90%
I still do that to this day.

00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:33.130 align:middle line:84%
I can't seem make
anything happen.

00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:35.196 align:middle line:90%
I have to be invited.

00:53:35.196 --> 00:53:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: So I'm going to
rephrase it a little bit.

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.340 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
wait to be invited.

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:41.260 align:middle line:90%
The invitations are wonderful.

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:43.930 align:middle line:84%
But it is, as you say, it's
about being conscious of what

00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:46.010 align:middle line:84%
it is in the life
around you that

00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:50.070 align:middle line:84%
resonates your frequency, your
very particular frequency.

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:52.416 align:middle line:84%
So it's very possible for
projectors to put out you

00:53:52.416 --> 00:53:53.790 align:middle line:84%
know this is
something I'd really

00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:55.200 align:middle line:90%
like to call into my life.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do that.

00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: And sure enough,
the invitation comes.

00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:53:58.600 --> 00:53:59.630 align:middle line:90%
It's the invitation.

00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:01.667 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: So what most
projectors are being told

00:54:01.667 --> 00:54:03.750 align:middle line:84%
is, oh, no you've just got
to sit on the sidelines

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:05.360 align:middle line:90%
until something happens.

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
far from the truth.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's just not sending out
your resume to 100 companies.

00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:12.630 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing.

00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: It's being
very particular

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:17.140 align:middle line:84%
about what resonates with
your very particular nature.

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
talk about manifestors.

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.065 align:middle line:90%
They're interesting people.

00:54:22.065 --> 00:54:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Very interesting.

00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And we all say, oh, I'd
love to be a manifestor.

00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Actually manifestors don't
have such a great better

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.319 align:middle line:90%
deal than anybody else.

00:54:31.319 --> 00:54:33.359 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's talk
about their attributes

00:54:33.359 --> 00:54:34.340 align:middle line:90%
and then why that is.

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: So manifestors, they
have a very specific design

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:40.160 align:middle line:84%
in life where they catalyze
activities around them.

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:43.360 align:middle line:84%
So by themself, yes,
they can manifest things.

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.540 align:middle line:90%
They make things happen.

00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:46.590 align:middle line:84%
They see something
they want to go after

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:48.580 align:middle line:90%
and sure enough, it happens.

00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:50.982 align:middle line:84%
But they have this
situation where

00:54:50.982 --> 00:54:52.440 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
people around them

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:54.800 align:middle line:90%
that don't have this ability.

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're watching
this manifestor

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:57.383 align:middle line:90%
doing this and doing that.

00:54:57.383 --> 00:54:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind
of concerned, what

00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:00.740 align:middle line:84%
is that manifestor
going to do next?

00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:03.250 align:middle line:90%
I think I'll just stop them.

00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:04.222 align:middle line:90%
So manifestors find--

00:55:04.222 --> 00:55:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're like
whirling dervishes in a sense.

00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Well,
along those lines.

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:12.140 align:middle line:84%
You know they're just in this
energy field in their life.

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Right from the moment
they learn to crawl.

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:15.580 align:middle line:84%
You know the baby's
off out of the room.

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:16.496 align:middle line:90%
Where did the baby go?

00:55:16.496 --> 00:55:17.930 align:middle line:90%
Well it's manifesting.

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:20.350 align:middle line:84%
It's got places to go
and people to meet.

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Their baby's going to
have a wonderful time.

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.530 align:middle line:84%
So people grab the baby,
put it back in the crib,

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:28.470 align:middle line:84%
and the next time it gets to
the door, the door is locked.

00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:31.810 align:middle line:84%
So manifestors find this
consistently in their life

00:55:31.810 --> 00:55:33.890 align:middle line:84%
that everybody
tries to block them.

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:35.550 align:middle line:90%
They disapprove.

00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And the manifestors walks into
the room and everyone picks

00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:41.360 align:middle line:84%
up, the energy the room has just
changed because all of a sudden

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:43.580 align:middle line:84%
on the one side there's
tremendous capability

00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:45.539 align:middle line:84%
has walked in here, but
there's also a sense--

00:55:45.539 --> 00:55:46.455 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A whirlwind.

00:55:46.455 --> 00:55:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: A whirlwind.

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:48.847 align:middle line:90%
But there's also a danger.

00:55:48.847 --> 00:55:49.930 align:middle line:90%
What are they going to do?

00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to turn
my life inside out?

00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:53.770 align:middle line:90%
I better stop them while I can.

00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I tend to
jump back, I have

00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:57.060 align:middle line:90%
some manifestors girlfriends.

00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:59.120 align:middle line:84%
They're very
capable, very smart.

00:55:59.120 --> 00:55:59.950 align:middle line:90%
I adore them.

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But I tend to just kind of jump
back and get out of the way.

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: That is
what a manifestors

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.970 align:middle line:84%
loves for you is not
only get out of the way,

00:56:06.970 --> 00:56:09.440 align:middle line:90%
but hold the door open for them.

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Go for it.

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.740 align:middle line:90%
You make all the plans, please?

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Right.

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Or can I come along
because it's a lot of fun

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:16.590 align:middle line:90%
being around a manifestor.

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:16.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:19.136 align:middle line:84%
I mean I've literally watched
this with manifestors.

00:56:19.136 --> 00:56:21.120 align:middle line:90%
They walk past somebody.

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Nothing's happened to
this person for years.

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And as the manifestors
walks past,

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:26.617 align:middle line:90%
everything starts to happen.

00:56:26.617 --> 00:56:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yeah.

00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:29.944 align:middle line:84%
So someone's been in
a slump for years.

00:56:29.944 --> 00:56:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
the manifestors just

00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:32.850 align:middle line:90%
kicks it into gear for them.

00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then
other people can

00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:36.140 align:middle line:84%
find them super annoying
sometimes because there's

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:38.140 align:middle line:90%
just way too much chaos.

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yeah.

00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:41.064 align:middle line:84%
Can't you just sit down
and take it easy for a bit?

00:56:41.064 --> 00:56:43.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, no I'm manifesting.

00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So we can make fun about this,
but I always say to people

00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:50.180 align:middle line:84%
if you're not a manifestor,
make sure you have at least

00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:52.150 align:middle line:90%
one manifestors in your life.

00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:54.415 align:middle line:84%
Because if they
like you and they'll

00:56:54.415 --> 00:56:55.540 align:middle line:90%
help you facilitate things.

00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:57.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:59.250 align:middle line:90%
They're irreplaceable in that.

00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Exactly.

00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:00.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Now we go to the
rarest of all, 1%

00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:05.910 align:middle line:90%
of the population, reflectors.

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:08.390 align:middle line:10%
And doesn't that mean none of
those centers are filled in.

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:09.570 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKYN: None of
them are colored in.

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nothing's colored in.

00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:14.220 align:middle line:84%
So explain the implications
of that and how they function.

00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:17.732 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Well, again I say,
if you're not a reflector,

00:57:17.732 --> 00:57:19.940 align:middle line:84%
you need to have at least
one reflector in your life.

00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you know
one, because they're

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:24.420 align:middle line:84%
going to give you a pure
reflection of who you are.

00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:25.870 align:middle line:90%
That's what they do.

00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:29.050 align:middle line:84%
That's why we just call this
design a reflector design.

00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:30.750 align:middle line:90%
They're pure empaths.

00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:32.270 align:middle line:84%
They have the
potential to pick up

00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:34.490 align:middle line:84%
everything that's going on
around them, whether it's

00:57:34.490 --> 00:57:36.114 align:middle line:84%
here or on the other
side of the world,

00:57:36.114 --> 00:57:37.930 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, they're
just completely open.

00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:40.180 align:middle line:84%
So in olden times, they
would be the high priestess

00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:43.090 align:middle line:84%
in the temple, you know that
only met with certain people

00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:45.850 align:middle line:84%
because they were living on
the other side of the veil.

00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:47.300 align:middle line:90%
And they were just very remote.

00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:49.008 align:middle line:84%
And they were communing
with the universe

00:57:49.008 --> 00:57:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and picking up the
wisdom that people

00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:54.350 align:middle line:84%
would need in the community
to be able to prosper.

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:56.870 align:middle line:84%
In these times, reflectors
come into this world

00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and they mostly think
there's something really

00:57:58.830 --> 00:58:01.920 align:middle line:84%
wrong with them because
they're so different.

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:02.970 align:middle line:90%
The rest of us are all--

00:58:02.970 --> 00:58:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They have a
hard time finding place.

00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Definitely, yes.

00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not living
according to everybody else's

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.600 align:middle line:90%
ways.

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:14.250 align:middle line:84%
So what we always
say to reflectors

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:18.140 align:middle line:84%
is do appreciate your
situation and see

00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:23.640 align:middle line:84%
that you have this
potential to accrue

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.750 align:middle line:90%
an enormous level of wisdom.

00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because every center's
open for your experience

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:29.620 align:middle line:90%
and play.

00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes.

00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:32.810 align:middle line:84%
But do realize you are
very susceptible to being

00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:34.180 align:middle line:90%
overloaded.

00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So living in an
apartment building,

00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:39.010 align:middle line:84%
living in a dormitory,
living where there's just

00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:42.020 align:middle line:84%
a crowd of different people's
energies all around you,

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:44.570 align:middle line:84%
there can be this place
where you get overwhelmed.

00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:48.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's really worthwhile, at
least, having time in your day

00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:49.860 align:middle line:90%
when you have space to yourself.

00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:53.080 align:middle line:84%
So you can absorb everything
or let things settle in you

00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and come back fresh
into the world.

00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I had a boyfriend
once who was a reflector

00:58:57.830 --> 00:59:02.090 align:middle line:84%
and what a sensitive, very
brilliant, and very empathic

00:59:02.090 --> 00:59:04.750 align:middle line:84%
sensitive being,
really hard to be

00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:08.870 align:middle line:84%
around a lot of other
people or certain buildings.

00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Even the feng shui the way
buildings were laid out.

00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:14.144 align:middle line:84%
Everything had to be kind
of peaceful and perfect.

00:59:14.144 --> 00:59:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: Reflectors operate
in many, many different ways.

00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:20.420 align:middle line:84%
But that's how he survived all
the bombardment of energies.

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:21.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:23.341 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: But wonderful people.

00:59:23.341 --> 00:59:26.130 align:middle line:84%
I won't say I
collect reflectors,

00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:27.880 align:middle line:90%
but I know several reflectors.

00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:30.810 align:middle line:84%
I rely on them to give
me clear view of life

00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:33.230 align:middle line:84%
every now and again when I
feel like things are going off

00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:34.030 align:middle line:90%
target.

00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:35.279 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love Human Design.

00:59:35.279 --> 00:59:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I find this absolutely
fascinating.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And we are-- well,
we're well of time.

00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:42.300 align:middle line:84%
But Chetan, thank you
so much for joining me.

00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And you have these
two beautiful books.

00:59:44.810 --> 00:59:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I say that, I mean
they're really not just useful,

00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.260 align:middle line:84%
but they're
absolutely beautiful.

00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful imagery,
beautiful paper.

00:59:51.330 --> 00:59:52.590 align:middle line:90%
They're really well done.

00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:55.220 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time I've
had my hands on this lot.

00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:56.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the "Book of
Lines and Human

00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Design Discover the Person
You Were Born To Be."

00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.680 align:middle line:84%
But you have another
book coming up?

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Yes.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.600 align:middle line:90%
"The Book of Destinies."

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.620 align:middle line:84%
So the Human Design
book "Discover

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:10.410 align:middle line:84%
the Person You Were Born To
Be" and "The Book of Destinies"

01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:13.880 align:middle line:84%
is discover the life
you were born to live.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.310 align:middle line:90%
So it's a 20 year work.

01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:17.870 align:middle line:84%
It's my wife Carola
Eastwood and myself,

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:19.350 align:middle line:90%
we've been working on this.

01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Mostly I have to say it's been
me that's had my nose down

01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:23.240 align:middle line:90%
with this working on this.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:28.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's basically there are 192
different incarnation themes.

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:29.810 align:middle line:90%
192.

01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:33.960 align:middle line:84%
All of us have one of these
themes for our whole lifetime.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.940 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like the
theme music of a movie.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:41.170 align:middle line:84%
If you know the theme
of a movie or the story,

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:43.735 align:middle line:84%
it goes throughout
the whole play.

01:00:43.735 --> 01:00:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's your theme?

01:00:44.970 --> 01:00:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: My theme
is explanation.

01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:48.510 align:middle line:90%
All Right.

01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
that's my theme as well.

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKYN: It is
your theme as well.

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:52.396 align:middle line:90%
We explain things to people.

01:00:52.396 --> 01:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And we try to give different
viewpoints of things.

01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, there are 192
of these different themes.

01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:02.180 align:middle line:10%
Everybody that I've
read their theme to they

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:06.220 align:middle line:10%
either burst into tears or they
just have a huge realization.

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:09.530 align:middle line:10%
My goodness, this is
something from day one

01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:11.830 align:middle line:10%
that has always been
playing in my life.

01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:12.890 align:middle line:10%
It's magical stuff.

01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:15.330 align:middle line:10%
So I'm very excited about
this book coming out.

01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:17.692 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I am too so
after that happens,

01:01:17.692 --> 01:01:19.900 align:middle line:84%
we'll come back and do this
again, if you don't mind,

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:20.700 align:middle line:90%
on that.

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:21.764 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Love to.

01:01:21.764 --> 01:01:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fabulous.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.570 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:25.340 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely love
the information

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.650 align:middle line:90%
on all the candidates, too.

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:30.637 align:middle line:84%
Well I think people feel seen
sometimes for the first time,

01:01:30.637 --> 01:01:32.220 align:middle line:84%
when they have a
Human Design reading.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKYN: Indeed.

01:01:32.770 --> 01:01:33.603 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

01:01:33.603 --> 01:01:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you can get a
copy of "Book of Destinies"
