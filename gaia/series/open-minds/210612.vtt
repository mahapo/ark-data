[AUDIO LOGO]

00:00:08.748 --> 00:00:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JERRY KANTOR: People can
attack homeopathy for its

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.592 align:middle line:90%
ideology-- they'd be wrong--

00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:14.550 align:middle line:84%
for its science, they'd
be wrong about that too

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.842 align:middle line:90%
because it's highly scientific.

00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:17.220 align:middle line:84%
But for God's
sakes, don't bother

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.480 align:middle line:90%
attacking it for its history.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.878 align:middle line:90%
The history is real.

00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Acupuncture is a mini, mini,
mini, mini, mini stabbing.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: You're right.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: And homeopathy is
a mini, mini, mini, mini,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.480 align:middle line:90%
mini poisoning.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --poisoning.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: When people arrived
at the asylum, much of the time

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.310 align:middle line:84%
they were malnourished
and exhausted.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.950 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that
was done was to give them

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:90%
a rest, put them in bed.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.632 align:middle line:84%
When they operated correctly,
they were even self-sufficient.

00:00:35.632 --> 00:00:36.698 align:middle line:90%
I call them utopias.

00:00:36.698 --> 00:00:38.490 align:middle line:84%
People think I'll just
take arnica for pain

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of
musculoskeletal trauma.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know the deeper
meaning of arnica, which

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.200 align:middle line:90%
is really quite interesting.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Vaccines are one-size-fits-all
no matter who you are,

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.550 align:middle line:90%
how old you are.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Homeopathy is the functional
cousin of the vaccine.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.645 align:middle line:84%
You get a much,
much smaller amount.

00:00:51.645 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.020 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: How often
do we drive by people

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:10%
who've been discarded,
people on the street shouting

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.130 align:middle line:10%
at passer-bys?

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're frightened
at the unpredictability

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.780 align:middle line:84%
of the situation
or feel helpless.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.150 align:middle line:84%
There was a time when people
who lost their bearings

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:84%
had a place to go, beautiful
settings, nurses, healthy food,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and as much time and bed rest as
needed as well as non-invasive

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.120 align:middle line:90%
homeopathic cures.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're going
to be talking about today.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.260 align:middle line:90%
So welcome, Jerry.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.800 align:middle line:84%
It's so good to
have you with us.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And we've been having
very spirited discussions

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes
about homeopathics.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.368 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's jumping in
wanting to know this and that.

00:01:31.368 --> 00:01:32.410 align:middle line:90%
And this is your passion?

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yes.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.335 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're a homeopath,
you're also an acupuncturist.

00:01:36.335 --> 00:01:37.135 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yes.

00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these
two go nicely together.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Both of them are working
with energetic matrices.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: Well, I
can say something

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.150 align:middle line:90%
to fine-tune that a little bit.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.720 align:middle line:10%
>>KANTOR: When I was
in junior high school,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.420 align:middle line:10%
I had a teacher
who said that there

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.640 align:middle line:10%
was no definition of
life that didn't include

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.127 align:middle line:10%
the idea of irritability.

00:01:53.127 --> 00:01:54.085 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Irritability?

00:01:54.085 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Irritability?

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.897 align:middle line:90%
I said, that's pretty funny.

00:01:55.897 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:90%
I was 14 years old or something.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.630 align:middle line:10%
Well, so both homeopathy
and acupuncture

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.230 align:middle line:10%
work because they
exploit our irritability.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So acupuncture is a mini, mini,
mini, mini, mini stabbing.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.979 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're right.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: And homeopathy is
a mini, mini, mini, mini,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.290 align:middle line:90%
mini poisoning.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.207 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --poisoning.

00:02:12.207 --> 00:02:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: So it comes
down to how you're poked

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.888 align:middle line:90%
and then what comes out.

00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't want to be
stabbed, and you wouldn't

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.190 align:middle line:90%
want to be genuinely poisoned.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.230 align:middle line:84%
But both of these things
are very minimal, very,

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.000 align:middle line:84%
very minimal traumas that give
the vital force an opportunity

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.860 align:middle line:90%
to respond optimally.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And that has tremendous
repercussions.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And you know today
if you're reading

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.020 align:middle line:84%
news feeds and such about
health and well-being,

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:84%
you don't hear much
about homeopathy

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.860 align:middle line:84%
unless it's about
the royal family.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:84%
The royal family are famous
for generationally turning

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.670 align:middle line:84%
to homeopathics when they
need to overcome an illness,

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:84%
balance themselves
out, live long.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And they are noted for
their long lifespans.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yes.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
in part because they

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.370 align:middle line:84%
do homeopathic cures
instead of going

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:84%
for the invasive
allopathic medical route.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
that's all we hear.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.715 align:middle line:84%
The royal family does it,
and you know those kooks,

00:03:04.715 --> 00:03:06.160 align:middle line:90%
those eccentrics.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: Unfortunately,
homeopathy

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:84%
has been subject to a great
deal of mischaracterization

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.070 align:middle line:90%
and disinformation.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.863 align:middle line:84%
And that's one reason
I was compelled

00:03:14.863 --> 00:03:16.030 align:middle line:90%
to write this book because--

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.072 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Sane Asylums."

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:20.590 align:middle line:10%
>>KANTOR: "Sane Asylums" so
that doesn't continue at least

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.290 align:middle line:10%
at the historical level.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.910 align:middle line:84%
People can attack homeopathy
for its ideology--

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.350 align:middle line:90%
they'd be wrong--

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.678 align:middle line:84%
for this for its science
they'd be wrong about that too

00:03:29.678 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:90%
because it's highly scientific.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.670 align:middle line:84%
But for God's
sakes, don't bother

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.037 align:middle line:90%
attacking it for its history.

00:03:35.037 --> 00:03:36.370 align:middle line:90%
I didn't take those photographs.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.625 align:middle line:90%
I didn't read those--

00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:39.670 align:middle line:84%
I didn't write the
books that I researched.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:84%
The history is real,
and it has been

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.605 align:middle line:84%
denied to the public
up until this point.

00:03:43.605 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It has been
completely obscured.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, let's
look at how far back

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.460 align:middle line:84%
the history of homeopathy,
the practice of homeopathy

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.060 align:middle line:84%
goes in the sense of
microdoses of like cures like.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: Well the principle
goes back to Paracelsus.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.210 align:middle line:84%
But homeopaths would peg
the beginning of homeopathy

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.840 align:middle line:84%
around 1796 when
Samuel Hahnemann wrote

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.370 align:middle line:90%
his first papers about it.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And he just was an
incredible workaholic.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And he is still an amazing
source of information

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.649 align:middle line:84%
about tremendous number of
remedies and how to make them.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.410 align:middle line:84%
He had tremendously
powerful proponents

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.750 align:middle line:84%
like James Tyler
Kent and Constantine

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Herring going into the late
parts of the 19th century.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.820 align:middle line:90%
But it's 200 years old.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.260 align:middle line:90%
It's been around.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about it, just

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.470 align:middle line:84%
its essence for a
moment for people

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.292 align:middle line:84%
who aren't really familiar with
the nature of how it works.

00:04:38.292 --> 00:04:40.000 align:middle line:84%
The whole potentization
process, the fact

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:84%
that really, there's
nothing oftentimes even

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.010 align:middle line:84%
left of the original substance,
but that energetic imprint,

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:90%
the information is there.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Talk to us about that.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:90%
Water is the miracle of life.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And energy imprints
on the molecules

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.370 align:middle line:84%
of water impart
structure that is

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:90%
perceived at many, many levels.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.735 align:middle line:90%
It's quite powerful.

00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Masaru Emoto
did a lot to show

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.575 align:middle line:90%
that in his photographs.

00:05:05.575 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yes, that's right.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.857 align:middle line:84%
And when you not just dilute
the substance, but when

00:05:10.857 --> 00:05:12.940 align:middle line:84%
you vigorously shake it--
we call the succussion--

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.855 align:middle line:90%
that energizes the remedy.

00:05:16.855 --> 00:05:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you take
a little bit of remedy,

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.450 align:middle line:90%
you put it in water?

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: We call--

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --water?

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.868 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: --a mother
tincture which

00:05:21.868 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:84%
is a combination of
alcohol and water,

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.800 align:middle line:84%
which has a discernible
amount of the substance, which

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.320 align:middle line:84%
can be a botanical, it could
be a chemical compound.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.530 align:middle line:84%
It could be almost anything
that you can dilute.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.825 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you
have to titrate it.

00:05:34.825 --> 00:05:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you take a few drops of
that and put that in solution.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you
vigorously shake it.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:39.700 align:middle line:90%
That's a succussion.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
that's really where

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
it's imparting the information
into the molecules?

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yes.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And the more you do it-- that's
the strange thing about it--

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:84%
the more you do it, the more
powerful the remedy becomes.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And at least when the
matching is correct,

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.360 align:middle line:84%
the lower potency of the remedy
have a more general effect,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.725 align:middle line:90%
but they're not as long-lasting.

00:05:56.725 --> 00:05:57.850 align:middle line:90%
So you have to repeat them.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.360 align:middle line:84%
But the higher potency remedies
have this very, very strong,

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.573 align:middle line:90%
energetic imprint.

00:06:03.573 --> 00:06:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's a high
stakes bet when you

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.280 align:middle line:90%
give that to somebody exactly.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.488 align:middle line:84%
The homeopath should know
exactly what they're doing.

00:06:08.488 --> 00:06:10.400 align:middle line:84%
But then you get the
most maximal effect.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So are you talking
about when you say highest

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.030 align:middle line:90%
potency--

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.520 align:middle line:84%
so here, first we're
talking about when

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.312 align:middle line:84%
it's diluted, diluted,
diluted to the point

00:06:17.312 --> 00:06:19.660 align:middle line:84%
where no original molecules
of the original substance

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.020 align:middle line:90%
are left.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: That's right.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.102 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there's a highly
potent body of information

00:06:23.102 --> 00:06:23.935 align:middle line:90%
that's been encoded.

00:06:23.935 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yes.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does
that have anything

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.360 align:middle line:84%
to do with potency as we
see it in the drugstore?

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.710 align:middle line:90%
6, 30, 200.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: 60 Is low potency.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:84%
This X range remedies
are by far the lowest.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.040 align:middle line:84%
The Seltzers will be
basically 6x remedies.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.290 align:middle line:84%
60 is low, 30 is
higher, and that

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.940 align:middle line:84%
will have a substantive effect
but not be as strong as a 200.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.490 align:middle line:84%
The 200 and the 1 Ms
and so forth beyond that

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:84%
are generally not
sold in the stores

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.580 align:middle line:84%
because you should
really know what you're

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.980 align:middle line:84%
doing when you give them,
which is to say that something

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.700 align:middle line:84%
at a high level may produce an
aggravation, which is a healing

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:90%
crisis.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not
familiar with that,

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.702 align:middle line:84%
then you better be
working with somebody.

00:07:02.702 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't want to
do that on your own.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.392 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I might 200 cc's,
but it's usually arnica.

00:07:07.392 --> 00:07:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Arnica, yeah.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.767 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk-- now, that's

00:07:09.767 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:84%
one thing most people watching
this certainly understand.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Will they know arnica for its
anti-inflammatory properties?

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.660 align:middle line:84%
But you say it goes
far beyond that.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: I do.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.643 align:middle line:84%
And so that's typical
of what's happened

00:07:19.643 --> 00:07:21.310 align:middle line:84%
in the marketing of
something like that.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.143 align:middle line:84%
People think, I'll just
take arnica for pain

00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:25.030 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of
musculoskeletal trauma,

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.400 align:middle line:84%
but they don't know the deeper
meaning of arnica, which

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:90%
is really quite interesting.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.328 align:middle line:84%
It's a mountain laurel, so it
grows high in the mountains.

00:07:31.328 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And that relates a little
bit to what it actually

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.212 align:middle line:84%
does at the energetic
or spiritual level.

00:07:36.212 --> 00:07:38.170 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there's
a level of consciousness

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.934 align:middle line:84%
that we all have that is
invested in our intactness.

00:07:41.934 --> 00:07:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like a perfected
template of sorts.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Or is trying to
find its way back

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.445 align:middle line:90%
to a state of balance or yeah.

00:07:48.445 --> 00:07:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: We all need
to do that, yeah.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:84%
But let's say you have
a serious injury where

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.510 align:middle line:84%
you're losing a lot of blood
or you've had an amputation

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.330 align:middle line:84%
or you've been in a
severe car accident,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.130 align:middle line:90%
you go into a state of shock.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And this level of
consciousness says, the facts

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:84%
don't much match
my understanding.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.070 align:middle line:84%
This person I'm inhabiting
here should be intact.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's not the case.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The were
missing a toenail.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: So I leave.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.210 align:middle line:90%
I leave.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.710 align:middle line:84%
So a level of consciousness
leaves the body briefly.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And so the person will say,
I'm OK, when they're not.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's the key
note of arnica.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:24.158 align:middle line:84%
So that's a deeper understanding
of that remedy than someone

00:08:24.158 --> 00:08:26.200 align:middle line:84%
who just thinks, oh, this
will help me to repair.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.617 align:middle line:84%
When the soul is pulled back--
this level of consciousness

00:08:28.617 --> 00:08:30.760 align:middle line:84%
is pulled back into
the body, healing

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.230 align:middle line:84%
is much more possible
than when it's not there.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.409 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
arnica actually works.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.548 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it
helps pull that portion

00:08:37.548 --> 00:08:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: It pulls that--

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's why
it's used-- which I just

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.645 align:middle line:84%
learned very recently-- is used
for emotional trauma as well.

00:08:43.645 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: Because
in emotional trauma,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.470 align:middle line:84%
when you think that a state of
shock is an emotional trauma--

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.595 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: We are not able to
process some kinds of shock.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.053 align:middle line:84%
If you're watching a murder
or you're in a car which that

00:08:54.053 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:84%
would completely flipped over
or if you've gotten a really

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:00.930 align:middle line:84%
serious injury, you cannot
possibly process that

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:01.730 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.430 align:middle line:84%
So we are designed so that
we go into a state of shock

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:84%
so that later on we
can deal with it.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.240 align:middle line:84%
If you meet somebody who goes
in who's feeling like that,

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.160 align:middle line:84%
you say, wow, that's
a really strong person

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.180 align:middle line:90%
said nothing happened.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.440 align:middle line:90%
Everything's OK.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:90%
That's not accurate.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.240 align:middle line:90%
They're in a state of shock.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.770 align:middle line:90%
They're in that numb place.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: You're right.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.480 align:middle line:84%
If you meet them
a few weeks later

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.830 align:middle line:84%
and then they're
starting to process it

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.330 align:middle line:84%
and they're weeping
and wailing, you

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:90%
don't say, oh, what a weakling.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.180 align:middle line:90%
They can't handle this?

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:25.990 align:middle line:90%
You don't do that.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.290 align:middle line:84%
But basically, you
heal when your soul

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.500 align:middle line:84%
is completely in your
body when you're grounded

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and when this level of
consciousness is fully there.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.400 align:middle line:90%
And that's what arnica does.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's profound.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Much more profound
than taking care of--

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.053 align:middle line:90%
I take it for dental work.

00:09:42.053 --> 00:09:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: Well when you're
having significant dental work,

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:45.940 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of
that is going on.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.170 align:middle line:84%
You're a little bit
out of your body.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.300 align:middle line:90%
And it actually helps very much.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.810 align:middle line:90%
I find it helps a lot.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So OK, now that we've kind
of gotten a couple of the pop

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.200 align:middle line:84%
things on the table,
let's start getting

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.850 align:middle line:90%
into the story a little bit.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And what I was so
interested and reading

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.010 align:middle line:84%
"Sane Asylums" was
looking at where

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle line:84%
we are right now compared to
where this kind of healing

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.240 align:middle line:90%
was once upon a time.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.040 align:middle line:90%
And especially--

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.660 align:middle line:84%
I live in Sacramento,
California.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
many, many cities have seen

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:17.160 align:middle line:84%
is a much higher incidence of
homelessness and encampments,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.560 align:middle line:84%
where people are sleeping
out in the cold everywhere

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.730 align:middle line:90%
under every overpass.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.430 align:middle line:84%
They're everywhere just
trying to find some place

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.340 align:middle line:84%
to stay out of the wind
and the rain with people

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.910 align:middle line:84%
ranting and people
on drugs trying

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.980 align:middle line:90%
to self-soothe and alcohol.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.870 align:middle line:90%
And there's no place for them.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're trying to
build big places actually.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:84%
But right now, it's so
overwhelming the mental health

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.050 align:middle line:84%
crisis and there's
nowhere for them to go.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.030 align:middle line:84%
There's no one
looking after them.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing in place.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:84%
How do you see that
as someone that

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.945 align:middle line:84%
does what you do with such
great care for a living?

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: Well, that's
a huge question.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the homeless do have
a lot of mental health issues.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:00.203 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:11:00.203 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you that
in my own practice,

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:84%
and people getting
are presenting

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.760 align:middle line:84%
as sicker and sicker
because of an epidemic

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:84%
of autoimmune conditions because
of the effects of the drugs

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.520 align:middle line:90%
that people are on.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.630 align:middle line:90%
People are sicker.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And so it's harder for us
homeopaths to deal with them.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.668 align:middle line:84%
And there's always the risk of
they're regressing and going

00:11:18.668 --> 00:11:22.180 align:middle line:84%
back to their drugs because
they don't heal quickly enough

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.540 align:middle line:90%
and we have to detox them.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So back to your question,
what we fantasize about

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:30.610 align:middle line:84%
is having an asylum where we
can have people 24 hours a day

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.988 align:middle line:84%
and take care of them
so that we can get them

00:11:32.988 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:84%
through those crises
and not lose them back

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.550 align:middle line:90%
to the conventional means.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a real need for
asylum care for people.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:84%
But this is an era
that's quite bygone.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Basically now we drug people up.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.857 align:middle line:90%
We do the opposite.

00:11:46.857 --> 00:11:48.940 align:middle line:84%
We send them back to their
community like zombies,

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and we relinquish
our opportunity

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.170 align:middle line:84%
to work with them to grapple
with their mental illness

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.753 align:middle line:84%
at the level of what
used to be called

00:11:57.753 --> 00:12:00.670 align:middle line:84%
moral hygiene, intense
discussions with people,

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.200 align:middle line:84%
listening to them
very carefully.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.900 align:middle line:84%
The nurses at the
Middletown Hospital

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.350 align:middle line:84%
that I write about under the
direction of Clara Barrus

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.850 align:middle line:90%
were just paragons.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.290 align:middle line:90%
They were amazing people.

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:13.560 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
into her story.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:90%
Amazing people.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: She's a
lot to talk about.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.442 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, there is.

00:12:16.442 --> 00:12:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: And we would love
to have some places that we

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.600 align:middle line:84%
can care take people so that
we can work with them long term

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.280 align:middle line:90%
and not lose them.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's a number
of reasons why

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.420 align:middle line:84%
we would like to have
facilities like that again.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And they could be staffed
by nurses, acupuncturists,

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.005 align:middle line:90%
the pastors, chaplains.

00:12:32.005 --> 00:12:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Especially nurses,
much overlooked.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yes.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:36.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And really,
some of the people-- well,

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:84%
certainly
historically-- that were

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.210 align:middle line:84%
key to the healing processes
of people in the day,

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:90%
it was nurses, really.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.235 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want to go off of
one thing you said right now,

00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:50.110 align:middle line:84%
these days you're seeing
more and more people

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.160 align:middle line:90%
with autoimmune problems.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.080 align:middle line:90%
I have to ask you this.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.620 align:middle line:84%
All around the world, we've
had global vaccine programs

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.170 align:middle line:84%
where we've gotten all different
mish mashes of vaccines.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Has this had anything to do with
the change in our biochemistry

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.310 align:middle line:84%
or the functioning of our
immune system that you can see?

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: Well, I'm
afraid so, yeah.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:08.805 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just across the board?

00:13:08.805 --> 00:13:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Across the board.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.953 align:middle line:90%
People--

00:13:10.953 --> 00:13:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
now getting into--

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: It's a
troubling problem.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.612 align:middle line:84%
I mean, vaccinations are
the dysfunctional cousin

00:13:15.612 --> 00:13:17.232 align:middle line:84%
of homeopathy to
put it very mildly.

00:13:17.232 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain that.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.180 align:middle line:90%
What is a vaccine?

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: I mean, a
vaccine works basically

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.030 align:middle line:84%
on the idea of using to
like to prevent like.

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:28.280 align:middle line:84%
You get a small dose of cowpox
so that you don't get smallpox.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.580 align:middle line:84%
That's the law of similars
that homeopaths work on.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And the first vaccine by
Jenner, which the word vax comes

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:38.620 align:middle line:84%
from cow was to give people
a small dose of cowpox,

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.050 align:middle line:84%
which prevented them from
getting a more serious illness.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.990 align:middle line:84%
That was inoculation and pretty
close to how homeopathy works,

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.530 align:middle line:84%
except homeopathy when
they made that medicine,

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:48.730 align:middle line:90%
made it much more dilute.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So the big difference is,
vaccines are one-size-fits-all.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.550 align:middle line:84%
No matter who you
are, how old you are,

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:55.930 align:middle line:90%
you get the same darn thing.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.138 align:middle line:90%
And also much too much of it.

00:13:57.138 --> 00:13:59.097 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what I was going to say.

00:13:59.097 --> 00:14:00.575 align:middle line:84%
It's not like a
diluted compound.

00:14:00.575 --> 00:14:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: So when
you dilute something,

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.170 align:middle line:84%
you're actually going through
the process of making it

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.215 align:middle line:84%
of matching you
as an individual,

00:14:08.215 --> 00:14:09.340 align:middle line:90%
whether when you practice--

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Versus
actually infecting you.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:11.710 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.502 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: The acupuncturists
and homeopaths

00:14:13.502 --> 00:14:14.800 align:middle line:90%
have this experience in common.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Someone will show up
and say, oh, Jerry I

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:90%
fall between all the cracks.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.290 align:middle line:90%
I just don't fit any category.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:21.350 align:middle line:90%
What can you do for me?

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And I always say, well, to a
homeopath, everyone's a crack.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.585 align:middle line:90%
We want to work on individually.

00:14:25.585 --> 00:14:27.460 align:middle line:84%
We're not interested in
putting you in a box.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Your diagnosis does
not define you.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, homeopathy
is the functional--

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I would say the functional
cousin of the vaccine

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.660 align:middle line:84%
is that you get a much,
much smaller amounts of what

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:90%
matches you.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And that can prevent
another kind of a problem.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.455 align:middle line:84%
And it's perfectly matched--
should be ideally matched

00:14:44.455 --> 00:14:46.830 align:middle line:84%
to what's going on with you
at the mental, emotional, and

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:48.025 align:middle line:90%
physical level.

00:14:48.025 --> 00:14:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you should
theoretically not

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.550 align:middle line:84%
have any of these side
effects or problems

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:55.300 align:middle line:84%
with a society of people with
plummeting immune systems.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.950 align:middle line:84%
That should not be coming
out of homeopathy that's not.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Absolutely not.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.070 align:middle line:90%
That cannot happen.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:14:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That cannot happen.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: No.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
one of the things in your book

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:84%
when you're speaking
about these places

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.730 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to go into now that

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.940 align:middle line:84%
were in existence in
the late 1700s and 1800s

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.870 align:middle line:84%
into the early 1900s,
these bucolic settings,

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:17.320 align:middle line:90%
these asylums to foster sanity.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.140 align:middle line:90%
A lot of these people had--

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.210 align:middle line:84%
they had malnutrition
on one level or another.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of it was
really what was

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.830 align:middle line:84%
lacking in the diet
that was causing

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.390 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these
mental imbalances.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And I would think in
the day, maybe exposure

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.580 align:middle line:84%
to metals and toxins we didn't
really understand at the time,

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.380 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: One of
the rabbit holes

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.310 align:middle line:84%
I had to explore when
writing this book

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:43.670 align:middle line:84%
was the difference in
madness in that era from now.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And so rather than try to
engage with that question

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.300 align:middle line:84%
in every other
sentence of the book,

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.420 align:middle line:84%
I created a compendium
of madness perspectives

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:56.450 align:middle line:84%
in my appendix so I
can refer to that.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, things were
very, very different.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.680 align:middle line:84%
When people arrived at the
asylum, much of the time,

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.250 align:middle line:84%
they were malnourished
and exhausted.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.625 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that was
done was to give them a rest,

00:16:06.625 --> 00:16:09.783 align:middle line:84%
put them in bed, give them
really good nutrition,

00:16:09.783 --> 00:16:11.200 align:middle line:84%
which state of the
art at the time

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.052 align:middle line:84%
involved warm milk
was one of the--

00:16:13.052 --> 00:16:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Warm milk was
really prominent, yeah.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: And the milk was a
high quality and after that--

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Directly
from the cows,

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:19.480 align:middle line:90%
not pasteurized and all that.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.438 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: That's right.

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:21.250 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Also these asylums work
best when they weren't like

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.500 align:middle line:84%
2,000-person,
2,000-bed facilities,

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.782 align:middle line:84%
which is what they grew into
later on and which turned out

00:16:29.782 --> 00:16:31.990 align:middle line:84%
to be their demise because
how can you do really good

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.360 align:middle line:90%
homeopathy with 2,000 clients?

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: But yeah, bit by
bit, they were really nurtured.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:84%
They were told, you're going
to be here indefinitely,

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.450 align:middle line:90%
we're going to get you together.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.075 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to rush you back
into your dysfunctional family

00:16:46.075 --> 00:16:47.465 align:middle line:90%
or into the community.

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:49.090 align:middle line:84%
We're going to let
you engage in things

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.610 align:middle line:84%
that are absolutely pleasurable
and beneficial to you,

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:55.480 align:middle line:84%
let you work on a craft, let
you participate in the garden,

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.930 align:middle line:84%
let you listen to and
create music, write letters.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.855 align:middle line:84%
Clara Barrus, who's one
of the heroes of my book--

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:04.210 align:middle line:84%
there is the other Clara
Bar-- was Clara Barton, who

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.510 align:middle line:84%
was the very, very famous
angel of the battlefield

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:11.020 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, had this
counterpart in Clara Barrus who

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:15.115 align:middle line:84%
was wrote this fantastic book
called "Nursing the Insane."

00:17:15.115 --> 00:17:17.560 align:middle line:84%
A fantastic book,
really brilliant book,

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.400 align:middle line:90%
very compassionate person.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.569 align:middle line:84%
And so she would have them
engage in giggle classes,

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:90%
get people to laugh.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Giggle.

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:25.485 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, giggle therapy.

00:17:25.485 --> 00:17:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Giggle classes.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.602 align:middle line:90%
It was one thing she did.

00:17:27.602 --> 00:17:30.850 align:middle line:84%
But she had just tremendous
respect for the mentally ill.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And she imparted
that to the nurses.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So as I say, they
engaged with the clients

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:84%
actively in terms of trying to
release them from the delusions

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.915 align:middle line:84%
that they had with
patience and kindness.

00:17:43.915 --> 00:17:46.780 align:middle line:90%


00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.630 align:middle line:84%
It was very different from
the nursing obligations today.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Nurses are wonderful
today, but they

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.713 align:middle line:84%
don't have the time
or the opportunity

00:17:52.713 --> 00:17:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and this just does
not happen anywhere,

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.640 align:middle line:84%
not in a psychiatrist
office, not

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.220 align:middle line:84%
in any of these
mental health clinics.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because no one's
given that valuable commodity

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:03.085 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:18:03.085 --> 00:18:03.885 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yes.

00:18:03.885 --> 00:18:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you
write about her and some

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:84%
of the other nurses, it's
like as you said earlier,

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:90%
they're like paragons of virtue.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And she wrote a directive on
what a good nurse ought to be.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.193 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can share a
little bit of that with us.

00:18:18.193 --> 00:18:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: Better if you
read her actual words.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:21.130 align:middle line:90%
She's quite a good writer.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:21.310 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She was, yeah.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: --basically being
free from discouragement,

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.710 align:middle line:84%
paying very close
attention to the clients,

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.920 align:middle line:84%
to their cleanliness, being
very observant to what they did

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.190 align:middle line:84%
and what they said, not
engaging them with arguments.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.740 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it's advanced
placement common sense.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.070 align:middle line:84%
How would you-- if you were
to deal with your client as

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.770 align:middle line:90%
you would with a sick relative.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.462 align:middle line:90%
Kind of the same thing.

00:18:43.462 --> 00:18:44.545 align:middle line:90%
It's hugely compassionate.

00:18:44.545 --> 00:18:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very,
very compassionate.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:49.805 align:middle line:84%
So here you have
bucolic settings.

00:18:49.805 --> 00:18:50.605 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah.

00:18:50.605 --> 00:18:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This was
really-- nature

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.185 align:middle line:90%
was part of it having space.

00:18:53.185 --> 00:18:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: And there was
more nature around then.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.400 align:middle line:90%
They picked beautiful settings.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.620 align:middle line:90%
And they had a lot of land.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And homeopathy was not
controversial back then.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And the states would give
them huge land grants.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.030 align:middle line:84%
The states would
subsidize these places.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.138 align:middle line:84%
And when they're
operated correctly,

00:19:12.138 --> 00:19:13.430 align:middle line:90%
they were even self-sufficient.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.260 align:middle line:84%
I call them utopias like
the Middletown Asylum--

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, very utopian.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.015 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: --was able
to sustain itself.

00:19:18.015 --> 00:19:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
that and Dr. Selden Talcott

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.380 align:middle line:84%
in his role in all
of that because he's

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:24.530 align:middle line:90%
another hero in the book.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:90%
He's a hero in my book.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:32.240 align:middle line:84%
So he was a Civil War physician,
had a very extensive training

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:90%
in homeopathy.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.120 align:middle line:84%
He actually ran a homeopathic
alcoholism facility

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.990 align:middle line:84%
in New York at Ward's Island,
just an absolutely wonderful,

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.530 align:middle line:84%
hugely respected person,
disciple of a homeopath

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.480 align:middle line:84%
by the name of
Samuel Lilienthal.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And he was the
second superintend

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:50.850 align:middle line:84%
in Middletown Homeopathic
Hospital for the Insane

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.870 align:middle line:90%
as it was called then.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And he was involved in
its every aspect of it--

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.870 align:middle line:84%
well, the design was there,
but he refined that a lot.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.280 align:middle line:90%
But he ran a tight ship.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.760 align:middle line:90%
It was budgetary on target.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.040 align:middle line:84%
The thing that he did that
really made him stand out

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.395 align:middle line:90%
was using baseball as a therapy.

00:20:10.395 --> 00:20:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of where
your interest in this

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:14.170 align:middle line:90%
started, right?

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: It was an
easy thing to do.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.795 align:middle line:84%
There was a baseball
field there.

00:20:16.795 --> 00:20:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And initially, some
of the staff members

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:84%
and the doctors and the
patients played together.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And he noticed that
the patients there were

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:90%
watching this very intently.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.330 align:middle line:90%
And he was an observant man.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.250 align:middle line:84%
He said, baseball seems
to make a difference.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.500 align:middle line:84%
They were all better when
they were watching baseball.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So he created this
fantastic team.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:37.410 align:middle line:84%
He poached players from local
teams and created this team,

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.930 align:middle line:84%
not with the inmates
playing for it,

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.490 align:middle line:90%
but to represent the asylum.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And the team was
called the Asylums.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were an
absolute powerhouse.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.300 align:middle line:84%
They had a future Hall
of Famer, Jack Chesbro.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And they played Major
League teams to a stand off,

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and big crowds came
to watch the games.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And even the craziest
of the clients

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.920 align:middle line:84%
would come out in rapt
attention watch this.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.870 align:middle line:90%
But he was also--

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:02.683 align:middle line:84%
the Middletown
facility was what I

00:21:02.683 --> 00:21:04.350 align:middle line:84%
call the Mother Church
for this movement

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.560 align:middle line:84%
because it was the really
most the biggest, the most

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.360 align:middle line:90%
successful mental health asylum.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So many other psychiatrists,
homeopathic psychiatrists

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.640 align:middle line:90%
went and did internships there.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And then they went and
worked at other facilities

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:21.720 align:middle line:84%
like at Butler Asylum in
Providence, Fergus Falls

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.600 align:middle line:90%
in Minnesota, Westborough.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And then when they completed
their careers there,

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.930 align:middle line:84%
they would often open
small sanitariums,

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.370 align:middle line:90%
private sanitariums.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:37.020 align:middle line:84%
But Talcott was just a
hugely respected homeopath.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.600 align:middle line:84%
We have in our material
medico, the software

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.930 align:middle line:84%
for a practitioner, one of
his books that we refer to.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:45.800 align:middle line:84%
So he was a successful
man on many levels.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So one thing
you talked about a little

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.250 align:middle line:90%
bit ago was the alcoholism part.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.440 align:middle line:84%
So this I found
intriguing in the book.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Following the Civil War,
there was a huge issue

00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:00.480 align:middle line:84%
with alcoholism, just the
disorientation of coming back

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.650 align:middle line:84%
from such an incredibly
brutal situation.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a book called
"The Empire of Suffering"

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:84%
that goes into the carnage,
what the problems the Civil War

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.680 align:middle line:90%
caused.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.150 align:middle line:84%
That was interesting for
me to learn about that.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.240 align:middle line:10%
>>KANTOR: Back in those
days, I didn't know this,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.130 align:middle line:10%
people were deeply
invested in the idea

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:10%
that of the resurrection
of the body physically.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Actually, when you died,
somehow through this belief

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.640 align:middle line:84%
in Christianity, the body
would be resurrected.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And there was also
a high premium

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.640 align:middle line:84%
put on the value of one's
last words as you were dying.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Dying was not such a
big deal as the fact

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.490 align:middle line:84%
that you would give your
last words to describe

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:42.990 align:middle line:84%
how your life was meaningful
and that you didn't mind dying.

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:90%
The Civil War blew that apart.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.710 align:middle line:90%
The bodies could not be found.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.350 align:middle line:84%
When they were found,
they were obliterated.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:53.970 align:middle line:84%
There were very few inspiring
last words that were uttered.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.210 align:middle line:84%
The people went into a
gigantic crisis of grief.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is a primary reason
why all these mental hospitals

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:04.170 align:middle line:84%
sprung up, and also,
I imagine alcoholism.

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.680 align:middle line:84%
But the country was always
heavily into alcohol,

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:07.770 align:middle line:90%
it was used--

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.395 align:middle line:90%
people would drink--

00:23:10.395 --> 00:23:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I was reading about that, the
amount of alcohol per capita

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.290 align:middle line:90%
that was drunk back then.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:90%
Holy cow!

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.485 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: There's a great
book called "Saloon Culture."

00:23:19.485 --> 00:23:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were
anesthetizing heavily

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.980 align:middle line:84%
across the country,
men and women.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:25.800 align:middle line:90%
People drank heavily.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.980 align:middle line:90%
And that was a big problem.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And so what we now
call tardive dyskinesia

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:31.350 align:middle line:90%
in those days was called--

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:32.850 align:middle line:90%
had a different derivation.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:35.527 align:middle line:84%
Then it was delirium tremens,
late stages of alcoholism.

00:23:35.527 --> 00:23:37.110 align:middle line:84%
You'd just be sitting
there trembling.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:37.890 align:middle line:90%
The shakes.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And homeopathy can
ameliorate that too somewhat.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.170 align:middle line:84%
There are books on homeopathic
treatment of inebriation.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:47.130 align:middle line:84%
But getting to an absolute
cure when you're that far gone

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:48.660 align:middle line:90%
is a bridge too far.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
drug addiction?

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: What, today or then?

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, today.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Homeopathic approaches to
breaking drug addictions.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.278 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, we do that.

00:23:58.278 --> 00:24:00.780 align:middle line:90%
We have to detox someone.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would be a
combination of actually using--

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.810 align:middle line:84%
making homeopathic
preparation from the drug

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:84%
that has addicted you so that
you can gradually wean yourself

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.800 align:middle line:90%
from it.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.910 align:middle line:90%
At the same time, you would--

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:13.535 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
like nicotine patches

00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:15.497 align:middle line:90%
almost, but not exactly.

00:24:15.497 --> 00:24:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: People confuse
homeopathy with lots of things.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's not
desensitization therapy,

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:24.777 align:middle line:84%
although when you're using the
dilute versions of the drugs,

00:24:24.777 --> 00:24:25.860 align:middle line:90%
it is something like that.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:26.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: But then
you would also

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.580 align:middle line:84%
incorporate the constitutional
remedy and other support

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.310 align:middle line:84%
remedies and maybe remedies
made from neurotransmitters

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.450 align:middle line:84%
to help the person
get to the other side.

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.900 align:middle line:84%
But it's a matter of
creating a good game

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.235 align:middle line:84%
plan as opposed to
saying, we're just

00:24:39.235 --> 00:24:40.860 align:middle line:84%
going to cure you
with this one remedy.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.110 align:middle line:84%
That's what I mean by people
being sicker than before.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:44.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:46.683 align:middle line:84%
You just said something
I didn't know about.

00:24:46.683 --> 00:24:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Remedies made from
neurotransmitters?

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us a little bit
about that because right now,

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.745 align:middle line:84%
we've got all kinds of issues
going on with our brain.

00:24:54.745 --> 00:24:55.545 align:middle line:90%
Our brains.

00:24:55.545 --> 00:24:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: Well, the avatar of
that is a homeopath in Holland

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.660 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Ton Jansen.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.525 align:middle line:84%
And his brand of
homeopathy is probably

00:25:02.525 --> 00:25:03.900 align:middle line:84%
going to revolutionize
the field.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.940 align:middle line:84%
It's practiced
extensively in Europe.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And my colleague, Ruma
Biswas is a proponent of his.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.577 align:middle line:90%
And that takes a lot of work.

00:25:12.577 --> 00:25:14.910 align:middle line:84%
when you create a program for
somebody who's really sick

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:17.520 align:middle line:84%
and you want to intervene with
them in terms of detoxing them

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.645 align:middle line:84%
from the medications they've
taken, supporting them

00:25:19.645 --> 00:25:20.970 align:middle line:90%
with neurotransmitter remedies.

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:24.630 align:middle line:84%
This is very much a field
that's developing at the moment.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.840 align:middle line:84%
So she's doing more
of that than I am.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm still the
classical practitioner

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:31.410 align:middle line:84%
who prefers to work
with single remedies

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.470 align:middle line:84%
and really delve the
psychological profile.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:37.140 align:middle line:84%
But this is an important--
this is an emerging

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.117 align:middle line:84%
development in homeopathy,
very similar to what

00:25:39.117 --> 00:25:40.950 align:middle line:84%
I would say is what
happened with functional

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:43.050 align:middle line:84%
medicine in
conventional medicine.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Functional medicine developed
outside the medical schools,

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.450 align:middle line:84%
outside the internal
medicine program,

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.720 align:middle line:84%
but based on the work
of Geoffrey Bland.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's really taken off.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.550 align:middle line:90%
So this is sort of a parallel.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.675 align:middle line:84%
This is like functional
medicine within homeopathy.

00:25:57.675 --> 00:25:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does
functional medicine

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.170 align:middle line:90%
employ the use of homeopathics?

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: No.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.630 align:middle line:90%
Not conventionally.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:03.810 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: But it's a functional
way, a systems-wide way

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:09.030 align:middle line:84%
of looking at a client as
opposed to breaking you down

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.730 align:middle line:84%
like in a gastroenterologist
for your gastric system,

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:15.030 align:middle line:84%
a psychiatrist for your
mind, and a neurologist

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:15.990 align:middle line:90%
for your nerves.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:17.820 align:middle line:84%
At least within
conventional medicine

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.853 align:middle line:84%
there was this attempt
to look at someone

00:26:19.853 --> 00:26:20.770 align:middle line:90%
at a functional level.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.170 align:middle line:84%
But the problem there
still is the consciousness,

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:26.568 align:middle line:84%
which is so central to how
homeopathy works, who you are,

00:26:26.568 --> 00:26:28.860 align:middle line:84%
what has happened to you at
the level of consciousness,

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.630 align:middle line:84%
that is not part of functional
medicine as I know it.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:34.635 align:middle line:84%
You're still sort of treated
like a mechanical object.

00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's anecdotal.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.020 align:middle line:84%
In homeopathy, who
you are consciously,

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.540 align:middle line:84%
experiences that you've
had, what has traumatized,

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:43.710 align:middle line:90%
what your hot button is--

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I was just going
to ask you, that's

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:46.610 align:middle line:84%
the first question
you ask people.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: Well,
it's not the first,

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:48.940 align:middle line:90%
but it's an important one.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.600 align:middle line:84%
I let them talk and let my
clients talk for quite a while

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.170 align:middle line:84%
before I ask that because I want
to get at my own sense of what

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.230 align:middle line:90%
it might be.

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.230 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it's a very
important question to ask.

00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:59.605 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's
your hot button?

00:26:59.605 --> 00:27:01.740 align:middle line:90%
What's really sets you off?

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: There's two ways
of asking that question.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.443 align:middle line:84%
What's your least favorite
situation to be in?

00:27:08.443 --> 00:27:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're
in that situation

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.800 align:middle line:84%
that I had a video camera on
you, what would I see in here?

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.120 align:middle line:84%
What would you do after
your button is pushed?

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.920 align:middle line:90%
Do you get drunk?

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.337 align:middle line:84%
Do you punch
somebody in the nose?

00:27:17.337 --> 00:27:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Do you write a poem?

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.318 align:middle line:90%
Do you overeat?

00:27:19.318 --> 00:27:20.610 align:middle line:90%
Do you withdraw into your room?

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:21.485 align:middle line:90%
Do you get irritable?

00:27:21.485 --> 00:27:22.310 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.325 align:middle line:84%
That question has-- it's a
very, very powerful question.

00:27:25.325 --> 00:27:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because this
is also associated

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.560 align:middle line:84%
with what might show
up as illness in them?

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Absolutely.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Homeopathy is one-stop shopping.

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:38.720 align:middle line:84%
That is my entryway
into somebody.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.870 align:middle line:84%
It's funny how hard it
is to get this clear.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.330 align:middle line:84%
The mind and the body are
absolutely inseparable as far

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:45.440 align:middle line:90%
as this kind of work goes.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about one
of the most common

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:49.850 align:middle line:84%
and ubiquitous
conditions to humanity,

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's psychospiritual, and
it goes deep, back, back, back.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.386 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
fear of abandonment.

00:27:56.386 --> 00:27:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah.

00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:57.705 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:57.705 --> 00:27:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talking about
that, how would you

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.740 align:middle line:84%
approach that with a
person, the fear of abandon?

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: I wish you had given
me another hour and a half.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.230 align:middle line:90%
It takes the case of--

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, take
5 or 10 minutes.

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:06.410 align:middle line:90%
You've got time.

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:07.215 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: OK.

00:28:07.215 --> 00:28:09.090 align:middle line:84%
You know I've got a book
coming out next year

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:13.470 align:middle line:84%
called the "Emotional Causes
of Chronic Illness Homeopathy

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:14.790 align:middle line:90%
for Existential Stress."

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:17.860 align:middle line:84%
So abandonment would be one
of those existential issues.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.980 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't just mean--
we're using that word a lot

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.260 align:middle line:84%
these days because
of climate change

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.218 align:middle line:84%
and we say, oh, my God,
we're all going to die.

00:28:23.218 --> 00:28:26.220 align:middle line:84%
But existential actually
means many, many more things

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.500 align:middle line:90%
psychologically.

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.720 align:middle line:84%
So abandoned, if I was
taking someone's case

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:34.000 align:middle line:84%
and this was coming up,
that one word would not

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:34.800 align:middle line:90%
give me the remedy.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.592 align:middle line:84%
I would actually want
the person to tell me

00:28:36.592 --> 00:28:38.250 align:middle line:90%
the story of their abandonment.

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'd find out whether
they were actually orphaned

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:44.250 align:middle line:84%
or if someone was just a
completely unavailable parent.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Or was there a sibling who
was responsible for them

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:48.410 align:middle line:90%
who betrayed them.

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:49.993 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so
many parts of that.

00:28:49.993 --> 00:28:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Each one that creates
a different kind of feeling

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:54.550 align:middle line:90%
or experience, those nuances.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.433 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'd have to teach
you homeopathy about it,

00:28:57.433 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:84%
but I'll give you some
examples, remedies

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.500 align:middle line:90%
that talk about abandonment.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.020 align:middle line:84%
If you needed a remedy
like magnesium carbonicum

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.470 align:middle line:90%
or magnesium moriadicum.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.710 align:middle line:84%
One flavor of abandonment
there would be your parents

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:middle line:84%
would have been fighting
all the time, fighting

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.070 align:middle line:90%
and at each other's throats.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And that would have created
a great sense of insecurity

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.950 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And you would have become
a peacemaker, a terrible--

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.900 align:middle line:84%
and you would have you'd be
prone to big ups and downs.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Part of that picture,
you might become

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:27.090 align:middle line:84%
as a result of that or
a reflection of that

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:29.940 align:middle line:84%
have a problem with
gluten and with dairy

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.580 align:middle line:90%
and be very, very up and down.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.330 align:middle line:84%
That's the piece that
would be someone who

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:34.350 align:middle line:90%
feels like they are an orphan.

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:36.365 align:middle line:84%
They might not have
actually been an orphan.

00:29:36.365 --> 00:29:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's kind of
under that very big umbrella

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.500 align:middle line:90%
of various forms of abandonment.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, the poster
child for abandonment

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:45.945 align:middle line:90%
is a remedy called pulsatilla.

00:29:45.945 --> 00:29:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: OK?

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Pulsatilla, and it's mostly
for women or if men needed it,

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.580 align:middle line:84%
it would be boys up
to the age of 12.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's a feeling
of really genuinely,

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:57.570 align:middle line:90%
oh, you don't love me.

00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:59.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't
love me anymore.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.610 align:middle line:90%
You're not there.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And so people who
need that remedy,

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.290 align:middle line:84%
they cry at the drop
of a hat and they're

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:06.180 align:middle line:90%
also prone to sinus infection.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.790 align:middle line:84%
But there's also things
that are good about them

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.680 align:middle line:84%
that we don't want
to change them,

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.970 align:middle line:90%
but they actually are clues.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Someone who needs pulsatilla
will love to be outdoors,

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.230 align:middle line:90%
they will love fresh air.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:17.970 align:middle line:84%
They'll have a very
sympathetic quality.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:20.220 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to change
that, but you relate to that.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.350 align:middle line:84%
You feel that as a
homeopath with someone.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.760 align:middle line:90%
Use your own feelings.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.125 align:middle line:90%
This person is very sympathetic.

00:30:25.125 --> 00:30:27.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their whole
being cries out to me.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.312 align:middle line:84%
If someone has an
annoying personality,

00:30:30.312 --> 00:30:32.520 align:middle line:84%
we don't dismiss them say,
I don't want to treat you.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.180 align:middle line:84%
We say, oh, that's
my feeling you.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.485 align:middle line:90%
I have to use that here.

00:30:35.485 --> 00:30:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Why am I feeling that
from this person?

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.430 align:middle line:90%
What are they projecting?

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, is the
pulsatilla the person

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.000 align:middle line:84%
is very sympathetic
and very lovable

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and you just want to
go give them a hug.

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:48.420 align:middle line:84%
But this is a very
stereotypical kind of a picture.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.395 align:middle line:90%
Homeopathy has many--

00:30:49.395 --> 00:30:51.055 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're all
cracks, as you say.

00:30:51.055 --> 00:30:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: All cracks.

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:53.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's also what
we now might call

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.430 align:middle line:84%
political incorrectness
is that much of the time,

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:57.990 align:middle line:90%
it comes up for blondes.

00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:59.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not my choice.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just it's a certain
kind of a picture.

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
overly empathetic,

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:05.010 align:middle line:84%
fear of abandonment,
and all of this.

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: Other kinds
of abandonment remedies.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.830 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you this, this is
really interesting in terms

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:14.220 align:middle line:84%
of, to me, existential
issues even for children,

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:17.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, because I just came
upon this the other day.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a remedy
whose keynote is

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.310 align:middle line:84%
fear of falling
forward, falling down.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's a major
remedy for children.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.870 align:middle line:90%
It's called borax.

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, for a child the
feeling of being put down

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.500 align:middle line:84%
is an existential problem
because it means separation

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.940 align:middle line:90%
from the mother.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.390 align:middle line:84%
So I have this one
child who I tried

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.280 align:middle line:90%
to give borax to the other day.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.350 align:middle line:84%
She's actually I think
12 years old now.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:45.440 align:middle line:84%
But this remedy, this
state has come up.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I discussed
it with her mother,

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.570 align:middle line:84%
we talked about how at
birth this particular child

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.460 align:middle line:84%
right after birth she
had had a heart defect.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And she had to
have surgery, and.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.590 align:middle line:84%
She was tremendously congested
and whenever she was put down,

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:00.410 align:middle line:84%
she wailed and
wailed and wailed.

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So the feeling of it's not
just a mechanical thing

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:03.980 align:middle line:90%
being falling forward.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.530 align:middle line:84%
When you deconstruct it or
you do some excavation of it,

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:09.840 align:middle line:84%
you find it has its roots in
a problem like being put down.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So for a child, for an
infant being put down

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:15.470 align:middle line:84%
face down in the crib may
mean-- not for every child--

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.390 align:middle line:84%
but it may mean an
existential crisis

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:19.700 align:middle line:90%
like I'm going to be separated.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And separation anxiety
is part of that.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.305 align:middle line:84%
That remedy does not come
up very much for adults.

00:32:24.305 --> 00:32:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So you almost have to be
a psychiatrist, a psychic.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And all of this to be able--
because what you're doing

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:35.600 align:middle line:84%
is almost getting kind of
alchemical transformation

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.845 align:middle line:90%
in people.

00:32:36.845 --> 00:32:38.917 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: I don't mind
being called an alchemist.

00:32:38.917 --> 00:32:39.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't mind at all.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
it seems like to me.

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:42.345 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: Because
homeopaths have

00:32:42.345 --> 00:32:44.150 align:middle line:84%
to have a very
intimate understanding

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:45.570 align:middle line:90%
of these substances.

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:48.980 align:middle line:84%
So almost like saying, I know
the consciousness of iron,

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.900 align:middle line:84%
I know the consciousness
of aluminum.

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:54.675 align:middle line:84%
Because I know when
people have gone

00:32:54.675 --> 00:32:57.050 align:middle line:84%
through a homeopathic proving
where they've ingested that

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.670 align:middle line:84%
over a consistent period
of time, what mental,

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:01.250 align:middle line:90%
emotional mindset is created.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, this goes
beyond what psychiatrists do.

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Far beyond.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Far and beyond that.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.685 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I don't mind being
called an alchemist.

00:33:07.685 --> 00:33:08.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:08.485 --> 00:33:10.047 align:middle line:84%
So Paracelsus, you
say that's kind

00:33:10.047 --> 00:33:11.630 align:middle line:84%
of where it started,
was an alchemist,

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:13.430 align:middle line:90%
was noted as being alchemist.

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:16.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of baked
into the cake of homeopathy

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.110 align:middle line:90%
if you're doing your job well.

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yes.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:19.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: It's
really psychological.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:23.180 align:middle line:84%
It's probably the deepest
form of psychology

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.740 align:middle line:90%
that you can possibly encounter.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's
absolutely fascinating.

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:27.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So now back in the day, let's
go to the case of Mary Lincoln

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Todd because it's--
or Mary Todd Lincoln--

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:37.490 align:middle line:90%
it's absolutely fascinating.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:40.370 align:middle line:84%
In history, they don't
treat her kindly basically

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:43.980 align:middle line:84%
saying she was bat,
you know, crazy.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what
was going on with her,

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.080 align:middle line:84%
what the symptoms
were, and what happened

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.680 align:middle line:84%
before and after her
husband's assassination,

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.080 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately what
helped cure her.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah, this is a--

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they did
have these wonderful places

00:33:58.050 --> 00:33:58.850 align:middle line:90%
back then.

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:00.808 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: This is a very
complex story, but I--

00:34:00.808 --> 00:34:01.933 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's fascinating.

00:34:01.933 --> 00:34:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: --I think I figured
something out about it.

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Poor Mary Todd Lincoln,
she was from the south,

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:13.190 align:middle line:84%
so she was a pariah in
Lincoln's White House

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:16.040 align:middle line:84%
just being from the south,
her family had owned slaves.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.955 align:middle line:84%
She lost in-laws
in the Civil War.

00:34:18.955 --> 00:34:21.620 align:middle line:90%


00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.949 align:middle line:84%
She had a serious head injury
falling from a carriage.

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:27.679 align:middle line:84%
She was trolled by
William Danforth, who

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:31.250 align:middle line:84%
wrote these - this one
article that she was not

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:32.489 align:middle line:90%
Lincoln's first love.

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:33.739 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, he tortured her.

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:35.822 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: And then, of
course, losing two children

00:34:35.822 --> 00:34:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and having her husband
murdered right next to her.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.860 align:middle line:90%
She went quite nuts.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And the accounts of
that are very graphic.

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And her son, Robert Lincoln,
was worried about her.

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:50.219 align:middle line:84%
And he decided she needed to
be treated or put someplace,

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:51.540 align:middle line:90%
and she resisted this.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a trial,
a sensational trial

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.790 align:middle line:90%
of her sanity.

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:58.160 align:middle line:90%
14 doctors testified.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.190 align:middle line:84%
There was absolutely no question
that she was highly delusional.

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:03.950 align:middle line:84%
She had thought there were wires
being pulled out of her eyes.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:07.440 align:middle line:84%
She thought that the city
of Chicago was burning down.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Totally lost her plot.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:15.780 align:middle line:10%
>>KANTOR: She was completely
very delusional upset.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.250 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, she.

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:22.255 align:middle line:84%
Was found incurably insane
and a number of the doctors

00:35:22.255 --> 00:35:24.630 align:middle line:84%
there on the panel-- a number
of them who were homeopaths

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:29.520 align:middle line:84%
said, let's send it over
to Richard Patterson.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.910 align:middle line:84%
He's got a little
asylum in Bellevue,

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Illinois called the
Batavia Institute.

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Let's send her to him.

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Now, what was curious about him?

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.620 align:middle line:84%
He was a moral
care practitioner.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Moral care is a high level of
hand-holding, being respectful.

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:48.612 align:middle line:90%
Officially no drugging at all.

00:35:48.612 --> 00:35:50.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what
world care was.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So history gives us two stories
about Mary Todd Lincoln.

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And they both are
equally preposterous.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.377 align:middle line:84%
One was, well, that
report about her madness,

00:35:59.377 --> 00:36:00.210 align:middle line:90%
that can't be right.

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:02.130 align:middle line:84%
She was really never
crazy in the first place.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:03.180 align:middle line:90%
That's impossible.

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.930 align:middle line:84%
The records speak
for themselves.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And the other one was, well,
OK, yeah, she was pretty upset.

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And she just needed
some peace and quiet.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:14.587 align:middle line:84%
And then these two lawyers
got involved with her.

00:36:14.587 --> 00:36:15.420 align:middle line:90%
And they sprung her.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened there.

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Both accounts are ridiculous.

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So I focused on what actually
happened at the Batavia

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Institute with
Richard Patterson, who

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:25.500 align:middle line:90%
was not officially a homeopath.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Officially?

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: He was not
officially a homeopath.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:28.992 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You keep
saying officially.

00:36:28.992 --> 00:36:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: Well, because
people did declare themselves.

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.972 align:middle line:84%
At that time, it was still
a big paradigm bottle.

00:36:33.972 --> 00:36:36.180 align:middle line:84%
The homeopaths were making
all the money, by the way.

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And the regular doctors
were annoyed by that.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:40.680 align:middle line:90%
That's why the AMA was formed.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.778 align:middle line:84%
If I was living in that time, I
might have been pretty wealthy.

00:36:44.778 --> 00:36:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interesting because
the tables have certainly

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:48.100 align:middle line:90%
reversed on that one.

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think the allopaths
have said, well,

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:51.750 align:middle line:84%
we're never going to let
them eat our lunch again.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's never
going to happen again.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.460 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, these
homeopaths, they said,

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.572 align:middle line:90%
go see Richard Patterson.

00:36:57.572 --> 00:36:58.530 align:middle line:90%
It was like wink, wink.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:36:59.490 align:middle line:90%
They knew something.

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, Patterson, he was
a shrewd character.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.640 align:middle line:90%
He did not keep records.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.400 align:middle line:84%
But what I did
find out about him,

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.410 align:middle line:84%
he used some remedies,
the medicines

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:11.100 align:middle line:84%
that were popular at that
time, which is unquestionably

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.330 align:middle line:90%
quoted for homeopathy.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:14.580 align:middle line:84%
That's the closest they
can come to admitting it.

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.550 align:middle line:84%
His asylum, by the way,
opened almost exactly the time

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:20.520 align:middle line:84%
that the Middletown Asylum
opened in Middletown, New York.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.680 align:middle line:84%
This was homeopathy at
its absolute zenith.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And there was poaching
across the borders.

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.390 align:middle line:84%
People wanted to
help their clients,

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and they had control over
how much of substance

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.230 align:middle line:90%
would be used.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And the allopaths
were constantly

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:38.370 align:middle line:84%
using homeopathic dosage
remedies but not admitting it.

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And Patterson, I think, was
the perfect example of that.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.430 align:middle line:84%
In any case, within four
months, Mary Todd Lincoln

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:46.800 align:middle line:84%
is sitting on his porch,
writing letters to her friends,

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.920 align:middle line:84%
talking to his children,
just perfectly fine.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.745 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not stark
raving mad anymore.

00:37:51.745 --> 00:37:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Not stark raving.

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And then she was declared
with these lawyers

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:54.758 align:middle line:90%
that declared perfectly sane.

00:37:54.758 --> 00:37:56.070 align:middle line:90%
She had many problems.

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:58.875 align:middle line:84%
And I'm quite sure
that among other things

00:37:58.875 --> 00:38:00.750 align:middle line:84%
that Richard Patterson
would have detoxed her

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:02.730 align:middle line:90%
from chloral at that time.

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
remedies I can imagine

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.600 align:middle line:90%
that he could have used.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.360 align:middle line:84%
But it's a story
that's not been told.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.820 align:middle line:84%
I'll challenge anyone to show
me a history of Mary Todd

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Lincoln where
there's information

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.270 align:middle line:90%
about Richard Patterson.

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:17.460 align:middle line:84%
By the way, when I
was researching this,

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.580 align:middle line:84%
by funny chance, my
wife's a realtor,

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:21.840 align:middle line:90%
so she got a kick out of this.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:27.090 align:middle line:84%
As I'm researching this,
his Italianate mansion

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:28.843 align:middle line:90%
came on the market in Illinois.

00:38:28.843 --> 00:38:29.760 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking at it.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.420 align:middle line:90%
I got to look at it.

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:31.220 align:middle line:90%
It was beautiful.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:32.415 align:middle line:90%
He was quite well-off.

00:38:32.415 --> 00:38:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, he
did well with his--

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: He did well with--

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:35.833 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --unofficial remedies.

00:38:35.833 --> 00:38:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: I would like
to have bought it.

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:40.853 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about this.

00:38:40.853 --> 00:38:43.020 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you've worked
with people with autism.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is something
that's rising

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:45.870 align:middle line:90%
by the minute in numbers.

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:47.370 align:middle line:90%
You have worked with autism--

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Oh, yes.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.175 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in homeopathics.

00:38:48.175 --> 00:38:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yes.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
just talk about that

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.933 align:middle line:84%
for a moment because
many of the people that

00:38:51.933 --> 00:38:54.240 align:middle line:84%
are watching right now
have people in their lives

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.760 align:middle line:90%
who are on the spectrum.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote a book called
"Autism Reversal Toolbox"

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:03.840 align:middle line:84%
about four years
ago at which time

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.440 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was a pretty
comprehensive take on what

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.170 align:middle line:84%
you could use from
the homeopathic world

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:11.550 align:middle line:90%
to address that problem.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because again,
it's psycho spiritual--

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:14.490 align:middle line:90%
spiritual--

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:15.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in its base.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yeah.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.910 align:middle line:90%
And we also go into legacies.

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:21.870 align:middle line:84%
There are things that go on--
we didn't drop as an apple

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:24.640 align:middle line:84%
from the tree completely
independent of the tree.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.070 align:middle line:84%
There are definitely
legacies that

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.320 align:middle line:84%
would contribute to
someone's susceptibility

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:33.460 align:middle line:84%
to being born with a propensity
for becoming autistic.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh, boy.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:36.450 align:middle line:90%
It's such an extensive intake.

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:39.480 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I brought I
brought into my practice

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:43.380 align:middle line:84%
a few interns to help me to do
the initial intakes on autism

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.630 align:middle line:84%
because we want to
go into the legacies,

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:48.570 align:middle line:84%
we want to go into everything
that happened at the time

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:52.300 align:middle line:84%
during the pregnancy,
during delivery.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So the drugs that the
mother was on matter a lot.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:57.870 align:middle line:90%


00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.850 align:middle line:84%
The traumas that were
going on at that time

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:01.392 align:middle line:84%
when you're in utero,
they absolutely

00:40:01.392 --> 00:40:05.040 align:middle line:84%
have an effect on
the unborn child.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, the
vaccinations that have come up.

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:13.770 align:middle line:84%
So I've had physicians come
to me say very frankly,

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Jerry, this is my
vaccine-injury child.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.900 align:middle line:90%
They will tell me--

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Physicians.

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: They would know.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it's
absolutely, absolutely clear

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:25.350 align:middle line:84%
that after certain
vaccinations, absolutely

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:30.170 align:middle line:84%
lost all speech, lost their
vocabulary, lost eye contact.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:32.420 align:middle line:84%
So we take all that
stuff into consideration

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and we create a game plan,
which is, again, in this case,

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:39.215 align:middle line:84%
we can't do a single
remedy and say sure it's

00:40:39.215 --> 00:40:40.340 align:middle line:90%
going to be perfectly fine.

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And also if you say, well,
homeopathy doesn't cure autism.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.450 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:47.450 align:middle line:84%
In most cases, we've had some
really very, very good results.

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:49.820 align:middle line:84%
But for a family with
an autistic child,

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.730 align:middle line:84%
if a child who could not
make any eye contact suddenly

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:54.980 align:middle line:84%
is doing that or they're
suddenly asking questions

00:40:54.980 --> 00:41:00.830 align:middle line:84%
when they never ask questions
or they're completely impossible

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:02.510 align:middle line:84%
behavior becomes
much more manageable,

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:03.710 align:middle line:90%
these are enormous gains.

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
notice improvements.

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:06.800 align:middle line:10%
>>KANTOR: If a child
goes completely insane

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.130 align:middle line:10%
when he sees a vacuum
cleaner and suddenly it's OK,

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:12.925 align:middle line:10%
these small changes that if you
don't have an autistic child,

00:41:12.925 --> 00:41:15.050 align:middle line:10%
you wouldn't think are such
a big deal for a family

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:16.620 align:middle line:10%
like that are a very big deal.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:19.910 align:middle line:84%
So we work with these children
for quite a long time.

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And in my book, I
actually some case

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:27.800 align:middle line:84%
histories where the toxic
influences were not that severe

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.250 align:middle line:90%
and I was able to get cures.

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: The diagnosis of
originally on the spectrum,

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.620 align:middle line:90%
they were not on that anymore.

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:35.037 align:middle line:84%
Well, they might
want to retain it

00:41:35.037 --> 00:41:36.670 align:middle line:84%
so they continue
to get supportive

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:37.670 align:middle line:90%
services for themselves.

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:39.260 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha on that one.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So we just have a couple
of minutes left and right

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:46.250 align:middle line:84%
now as I started the show saying
there are so many people who

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:47.870 align:middle line:84%
are losing their
bearings who just

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:49.320 align:middle line:90%
can't find their way anymore.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And it can be from a
variety of reasons,

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:57.410 align:middle line:84%
but we're just seeing more
kind of anxiety rising

00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:58.610 align:middle line:90%
within almost every family.

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:02.180 align:middle line:84%
You've some kind of
anxiety disorder.

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:05.800 align:middle line:84%
What's your recommendation from
this alchemical, holistic point

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.610 align:middle line:84%
of view of where we begin and
what we can do for ourselves

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:13.370 align:middle line:84%
to start kind of
bringing ourselves back

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:16.220 align:middle line:84%
into an integrated state
emotionally and mentally.

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: Well, I would
say find a good homeopath,

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:21.830 align:middle line:84%
someone who's been certified
by the Council for Homeopathic

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Certification or maybe
the North American

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Society for Homeopaths.

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And start to enter
into that mindset.

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:31.670 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that is
very liberating about working

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:34.640 align:middle line:84%
with a homeopath is that you
begin to look at your illness

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.772 align:middle line:90%
very, very differently.

00:42:35.772 --> 00:42:37.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that's
random that comes out

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:39.200 align:middle line:90%
came out of the blue.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a mechanic would love to
have his car break so he can

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:43.790 align:middle line:90%
have the pleasure of fixing it.

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:46.970 align:middle line:84%
When you enter into
this world, you

00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:50.240 align:middle line:84%
get very interested in
how you got like that

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.528 align:middle line:90%
and what remedies do.

00:42:51.528 --> 00:42:52.820 align:middle line:90%
On one level, it's very humble.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.020 align:middle line:84%
It just increases
your perspective.

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:58.550 align:middle line:84%
You said things that were
very bothersome or obsessions

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:01.277 align:middle line:84%
or really constant
anxieties, they kind of go

00:43:01.277 --> 00:43:02.360 align:middle line:90%
into your rearview mirror.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.380 align:middle line:10%
And you say, what
was that all about?

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:07.430 align:middle line:10%
So your gain of perspective
is good in itself,

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:08.810 align:middle line:10%
but that also leads--

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:10.680 align:middle line:10%
that's really a deep
part of your healing.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:14.070 align:middle line:84%
So overcoming the fear
of disease, which has,

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:15.662 align:middle line:84%
of course, tremendous
economic value--

00:43:15.662 --> 00:43:17.120 align:middle line:84%
if we're afraid
all the time, we're

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.162 align:middle line:84%
going to be susceptible
to every kind of campaign

00:43:19.162 --> 00:43:21.600 align:middle line:84%
for every kind of crazy
drug, every kind of vaccine.

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.480 align:middle line:90%
We're very, very susceptible.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.080 align:middle line:90%
It's great for the economy.

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.110 align:middle line:84%
But it is not good
for us individually.

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:30.260 align:middle line:10%
Homeopathic remedies
are not patented.

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:32.690 align:middle line:10%
Consider this, regular
drugs are patented

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:33.773 align:middle line:10%
and someone has to recoup.

00:43:33.773 --> 00:43:34.773 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're cheap.

00:43:34.773 --> 00:43:35.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: They're cheap.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Someone has to recoup the
enormous investment that

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.950 align:middle line:84%
was made to get them
through the FDA.

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.990 align:middle line:84%
If you subtract that,
what do you have?

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:44.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very
affordable remedies.

00:43:44.315 --> 00:43:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: Yes, they're
very affordable.

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:49.340 align:middle line:84%
But my goal in this
lifetime is to get

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:54.680 align:middle line:84%
people to learn about them, to
reintroduce a hijacked history

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.958 align:middle line:84%
so that people are not
deluded and thinking

00:43:57.958 --> 00:43:59.000 align:middle line:90%
that they have no choice.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.400 align:middle line:84%
There is a choice, but we
have to fight for homeopathy.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.550 align:middle line:90%
We have to insist on it.

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:06.590 align:middle line:84%
This is something that you're
not going to go to your HMO

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:07.820 align:middle line:90%
and have pointed out to you.

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:08.778 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: That's right.

00:44:08.778 --> 00:44:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So well, thank you
for your lifetime of work.

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And when your new book comes out
about homeopathy and emotions?

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Yes.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:16.995 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's
it called again?

00:44:16.995 --> 00:44:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: "The Emotional Roots
of Chronic Illness, Homeopathy

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:21.710 align:middle line:90%
for Existential Stress."

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And I can, for the most
remedies that I use,

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:27.710 align:middle line:84%
explain the existential
issue that's

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:31.045 align:middle line:84%
at the root of your particular
illness at one particular time.

00:44:31.045 --> 00:44:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:33.090 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:35.780 align:middle line:84%
We have to be up for some
forensics, though, and digging

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:36.170 align:middle line:90%
into ourselves.

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:36.905 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: Spiritual forensics.

00:44:36.905 --> 00:44:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Spiritual forensics.

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.925 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what you
are, an alchemist,

00:44:40.925 --> 00:44:43.392 align:middle line:90%
a spiritual forensic artist.

00:44:43.392 --> 00:44:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KANTOR: I'm good with that.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.568 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, good.

00:44:45.568 --> 00:44:46.610 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Jerry.

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see you again
when the new book comes out.

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KANTOR: Thank you
very much, Regina.

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:50.525 align:middle line:90%
What a pleasure to be here.

00:44:50.525 --> 00:44:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.940 align:middle line:84%
I hope this has been
helpful for you.

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:56.390 align:middle line:84%

with homeopathy.
