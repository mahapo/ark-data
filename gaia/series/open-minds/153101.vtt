00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Certainly one
of the most essential beginning

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.940 align:middle line:10%
points on the spiritual
journey is to find your stone.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.730 align:middle line:10%
Some use it for meditation,
others for healing.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas Pearson has spent
his life researching stones

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.580 align:middle line:84%
and is here to talk about seven
of the most important stones

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.580 align:middle line:84%
from his book, "Seven
Archetypal Stones."

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NICHOLAS PEARSON: Thank
you so much for having me.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First of all,
I want to hear about--

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everyone has
their own stone story,

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.200 align:middle line:90%
their own crystal story, right?

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Right.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And since this
is your life's work,

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.550 align:middle line:90%
yours is interesting.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's begin with
your own crystal story;

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.350 align:middle line:84%
how old you were
when it all began,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.190 align:middle line:90%
and just let us know you a bit.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.524 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Sure, so it all
goes back to early childhood.

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:08.023 align:middle line:10%
I was always the kind of kid
that picked up rocks everywhere

00:01:08.023 --> 00:01:09.640 align:middle line:10%
I went, whether it
was to a National

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.520 align:middle line:10%
Park or my grandparents'
neighbor's driveway,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.830 align:middle line:10%
sorting through gravel.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.250 align:middle line:10%
And at the ripe
old age of eight,

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:10%
my grandfather gave me my
very first piece of quartz.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly stones weren't
these inert, dense items.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.980 align:middle line:90%
They were luminous.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.390 align:middle line:84%
They allowed light to just
transform them prismatically.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.640 align:middle line:84%
So I was beguiled, and
ever since then I've

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.180 align:middle line:90%
just been in love.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.470 align:middle line:84%
I've studied everything
from the folklore,

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:84%
the history, the
mythology, as well as

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.350 align:middle line:84%
the mineral science of it, which
I really, really appreciate.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.800 align:middle line:84%
So when I went away to college
on a music scholarship,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I was randomly
assigned, as if there

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.660 align:middle line:84%
is such a thing as
accidents like that,

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.220 align:middle line:84%
to work in an Earth
Science Museum

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.050 align:middle line:84%
at my university
in central Florida.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And because I came in with
all this mineral background,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.610 align:middle line:84%
they let me have almost
unrestricted access

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.230 align:middle line:90%
to the mineral collection.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.210 align:middle line:84%
I was able to work
on new exhibits

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.040 align:middle line:84%
and do a lot of
independent study,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and it was just
a beautiful thing

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.461 align:middle line:84%
to get all that mineral
science background to add

00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:06.190 align:middle line:90%
to my spiritual take on stones.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I assume that
you were playing with them

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.220 align:middle line:90%
all along throughout your life.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So was it the rainbow effect
of seeing the light come

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.000 align:middle line:84%
through prisms when you
were a little kid that first

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.137 align:middle line:90%
enraptured you with these?

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: I don't know
if it was just that.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.010 align:middle line:84%
It was something comforting
about the regularity

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
of the structure,
the fact that they

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.660 align:middle line:84%
were so predictable
in their forms

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.787 align:middle line:84%
and yet there were so
many different forms

00:02:27.787 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:90%
from so many different minerals.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:90%
I think it was just that--

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't just rock anymore,
they were gemstones really

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:84%
in their own right and
that's what drew me in.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.183 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when did you
start playing with them

00:02:38.183 --> 00:02:40.157 align:middle line:90%
more on metaphysical level?

00:02:40.157 --> 00:02:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: You know,
probably not long

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.845 align:middle line:84%
after I got that
very first piece.

00:02:43.845 --> 00:02:45.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, a lot of families
go to church on Sundays

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
and in my childhood we would
go to the library on weekends.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So I would pick up
a stack of books

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.220 align:middle line:84%
and convince my
dad that I really

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.260 align:middle line:84%
could read through the
whole stack in two weeks.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
one week it might

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.580 align:middle line:84%
be things like fairy
tales and world mythology

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.500 align:middle line:84%
and the next week it would
be mineral science for kids.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And I always tried to draw these
parallels between the two even

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.520 align:middle line:90%
from an early age.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I might read
about some sort

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.690 align:middle line:84%
of mythological
association of something

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.480 align:middle line:84%
like Carnelian for example
which the ancient Egyptians

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:84%
associated with Isis and
believed that it could still

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.070 align:middle line:90%
one's anger.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.894 align:middle line:84%
I might sit with it and see what
kind of effect it had on me.

00:03:23.894 --> 00:03:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
what I'm curious about.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.420 align:middle line:84%
What were your early
experiences with stones?

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Did they speak to
you in in a way?

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: In a way they did.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:84%
It was a long time before
I ever heard a proper voice

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.980 align:middle line:90%
in my head, if you will.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's OK.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.170 align:middle line:84%
We want to hear about those
voices in your head, though.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.860 align:middle line:90%
We like that.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.943 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Yeah, for sure.

00:03:37.943 --> 00:03:39.990 align:middle line:84%
But when I was about
in middle school,

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.420 align:middle line:84%
I dug into my father's
old CD collection

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and found a bunch of
New Age CDs that were

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.460 align:middle line:90%
real pacifying, real pleasant.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.970 align:middle line:84%
So I just taught
myself to meditate.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And the first couple of stones
that really did it for me--

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I had this little
quartz sphere that I

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.270 align:middle line:84%
would sit with and just
kind of enter the stone

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:90%
and visit that internal world.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And occasionally, I'd meet
these sort of consciousness,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.070 align:middle line:84%
these presences
within the stones

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:84%
that would either
lead me in a direction

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.710 align:middle line:84%
or just answer questions or
sit with me in that stillness.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And eventually I
found some stones

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.404 align:middle line:90%
that really did talk to me.

00:04:14.404 --> 00:04:16.029 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
did they-- what were

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:90%
you learning from the stones?

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.810 align:middle line:84%
What were they teaching
you I should say?

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: They had a
lot to say about what

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.250 align:middle line:90%
was going on in my life.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Crystals are natural mirrors;
they're natural reflectors.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.660 align:middle line:84%
So whatever we're
bringing to the table

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:90%
they're willing to complement.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.220 align:middle line:84%
So it might have been dealing
with anxiety or stress,

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:84%
or getting the A on
the test one week,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.654 align:middle line:84%
and the next it might have been
answering the sort of mysteries

00:04:38.654 --> 00:04:40.570 align:middle line:84%
like, well, why are we
all here kind of thing.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I don't
have a good answer to that

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.540 align:middle line:84%
except that we are here to
experience Earth to its fullest

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and stone is our
most ancient teacher.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.230 align:middle line:90%
We literally walk upon it.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:90%
We build with it.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.810 align:middle line:84%
We weave it into every
aspect of our lives.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And we have since
the dawn of time.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's here to support us in
every aspect of our journey.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you
think that stones are often

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.290 align:middle line:90%
billions--

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.350 align:middle line:84%
millions for sure, if not
billions of years old,

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the
recording properties

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.660 align:middle line:84%
of a quartz in particular,
tell us a little bit

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.060 align:middle line:84%
about your understanding
of the knowledge

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.067 align:middle line:90%
that they can contain.

00:05:14.067 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: For sure.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:90%
So all minerals are crystalline.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.504 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
things that makes them

00:05:19.504 --> 00:05:20.670 align:middle line:90%
minerals in the first place.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So not just quartz,
but they're made

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.490 align:middle line:84%
of these geometric
structures called lattices.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a framework where all
the molecules, atoms and ions

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:84%
come together to create this
really regular and rigid

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.310 align:middle line:90%
But nature is seldom perfect.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly imperfect.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.457 align:middle line:84%
And there'll be spaces
in that crystal lattice

00:05:36.457 --> 00:05:38.040 align:middle line:84%
or they'll be things
that are crowded,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.032 align:middle line:84%
and it's almost like it
creates these holes where

00:05:41.032 --> 00:05:42.240 align:middle line:90%
particles can become trapped.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Things like electrons,
photons, all sorts

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.480 align:middle line:84%
of things that we can
measure as well as

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.105 align:middle line:84%
lots of things that
science can't quite

00:05:47.105 --> 00:05:48.450 align:middle line:90%
measure explain just yet.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And so those become sort of the
receptacles for information.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's really in the
gaps between the latticework.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Absolutely, we
call them point defects.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a place where something
is shifted or absent or bent.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.890 align:middle line:84%
So they kind of become these
reservoirs or potential wells

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.110 align:middle line:84%
through which the particles,
the base units of energy,

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.910 align:middle line:90%
can become trapped.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.466 align:middle line:84%
But that's essentially just
recording at all times.

00:06:12.466 --> 00:06:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So we talk about needing
to cleanse crystals,

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.210 align:middle line:84%
we talk about needing to
program them with our intention,

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.940 align:middle line:84%
and really what that's
doing is it's somehow

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.910 align:middle line:84%
working with those little
storage spaces in the stones.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.980 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I always
find that fascinating,

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.660 align:middle line:10%
especially when you consider
the different experiences that

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.870 align:middle line:10%
have happened both
underneath and above the land

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.470 align:middle line:10%
in given regions of the world.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.970 align:middle line:10%
So for example, how
would you characterize--

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:10%
and we'll just stay
with quartz crystals.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.765 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about them in depth

00:06:42.765 --> 00:06:44.620 align:middle line:84%
later through the
lens of your book,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.440 align:middle line:84%
but let's just talk
about quartz crystals

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.930 align:middle line:90%
and where they come from.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:84%
So you have an Arkansas
quartz crystal.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.380 align:middle line:84%
You have a Brazilian
quartz crystal.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.050 align:middle line:84%
You have a Russian or
Ukrainian quartz crystal.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
the differences

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.550 align:middle line:84%
of what happens
when a crystal is

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.184 align:middle line:84%
born in a different part
of the world from another?

00:07:02.184 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So on the most
fundamental level,

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:90%
quartz is quartz is quartz.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.820 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be more
alike than they are different.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So they will have the
same basic functions,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.480 align:middle line:84%
but then they kind of
specialize with personalities

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:90%
just like we do.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.946 align:middle line:84%
We're all fundamentally
the same but yet

00:07:19.946 --> 00:07:22.500 align:middle line:84%
we can still have startlingly
different life paths

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:90%
if we start to compare.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.640 align:middle line:84%
So there is this
sort of incubation

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:84%
or almost like a
classroom setting

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.940 align:middle line:84%
inside the Earth where the
minerals, as they're forming,

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.350 align:middle line:84%
are receiving teachings
from the Earth Mother.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you can pick
up a piece of Brazilian quartz

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.610 align:middle line:84%
that feels radically
different from one

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.370 align:middle line:84%
from the Ural Mountains
of Russia, for example.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.234 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
fascinating because also

00:07:45.234 --> 00:07:46.650 align:middle line:84%
what's happening
above the ground,

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:84%
human consciousness
is constantly, well,

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.020 align:middle line:84%
perpetually interfacing, with
the stones under the ground

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:52.930 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So they have to be some sort
of record keeper for all

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.444 align:middle line:84%
of our collective experience
through the ages, right?

00:07:59.444 --> 00:08:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Absolutely.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.520 align:middle line:10%
Any time that-- if
we look at what's

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.740 align:middle line:10%
happening
energetically speaking,

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:10%
we're talking in terms of
electromagnetic fields,

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.970 align:middle line:10%
and there's a process
called entrainment,

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:10.511 align:middle line:10%
where two electromagnetic
fields when

00:08:10.511 --> 00:08:13.500 align:middle line:10%
they come into contact with one
another exchange information.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.084 align:middle line:84%
And the more regular one or the
higher volume one if you will,

00:08:16.084 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:84%
the one with the
greater amplitude

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.590 align:middle line:84%
tends to entrain or teach
the other one whatever

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.210 align:middle line:90%
it's got to say.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:84%
So any time we pick
up a stone we're

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:84%
going into that
state of entrainment.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully it's entraining
us, but oftentimes we

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.310 align:middle line:90%
leave our own mark on it too.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a two-way transmitter
and a receiver, right?

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Absolutely.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.220 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So we can speak
maybe more practically

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:42.240 align:middle line:10%
toward the end of the program
about the nature of how

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:10%
you go into resonance
with crystals

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.370 align:middle line:10%
and how we cleanse them.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to leave
time for all of that.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.760 align:middle line:84%
But I thought what we'd
do is start also speaking

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.040 align:middle line:90%
about the specific stones.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And also, before
we even go there,

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.930 align:middle line:90%
the cosmology related to stones.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we can go into the
individual stones and all

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.760 align:middle line:90%
their traits.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's not only the Earth
affecting the stones,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.750 align:middle line:84%
but also they're in resonance
with the cosmos-- "as above,

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:07.550 align:middle line:90%
so below"--

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.590 align:middle line:84%
with the cosmos, which is why
we have, quote, birthstones.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.560 align:middle line:10%
Explain that whole
thing about birthstones

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.049 align:middle line:10%
and cosmic influences
on the world's gems

00:09:17.049 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:10%
>>PEARSON: In different
parts of the world,

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.682 align:middle line:10%
in different areas
in history, there

00:09:20.682 --> 00:09:22.140 align:middle line:10%
have been different
stones ascribed

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.990 align:middle line:10%
to either the months
or lunar phases

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.930 align:middle line:10%
or the actual signs of the
zodiac and planets too.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:32.250 align:middle line:84%
So there are qualities in the
stones that perfectly reflect

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:90%
those qualities in the planets.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.900 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy, they like to talk
about the seven base metals

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.960 align:middle line:84%
and each of those relates
to one of those seven

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:84%
classical planets and
luminaries that you could see

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.950 align:middle line:90%
unaided without a telescope.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And so something like
copper, for example,

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.880 align:middle line:84%
has a really strong
Venusian energy.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:84%
It perfectly embodies
the energy of Venus.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at
stones that tend

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:57.600 align:middle line:84%
to be rich in copper, things
like dioptase, chrysocolla,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:84%
malachite, those are very
heart-centered stones.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And Venus is the planet
of love, romance, beauty,

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and we see those same things
happening in the stones that

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.390 align:middle line:90%
contain the same elements.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's a really deep
relationship between the stars

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.480 align:middle line:90%
and our own planet.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.130 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if crystals
are in and of themselves

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.094 align:middle line:90%
a constellation here on Earth.

00:10:17.094 --> 00:10:18.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well,
it is said in some

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.140 align:middle line:10%
of the mythologies of the
world that the way we have seen

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:10%
the structure of the gods
that affect this planet

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.660 align:middle line:10%
is actually representational
of the cosmic beings

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.235 align:middle line:10%
within our solar system.

00:10:31.235 --> 00:10:35.120 align:middle line:84%
That those entities themselves,
known by many different names

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and under different guises,
are the actual entities

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.700 align:middle line:84%
that are influencing us
from those subtle realms.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Absolutely.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.725 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
would be working

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:44.660 align:middle line:84%
in relationship with
everything, not just

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.790 align:middle line:90%
human beings on the planet.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.091 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: They even go so far
as to say that if you are going

00:10:49.091 --> 00:10:52.820 align:middle line:10%
to start using gemstones
for your own empowerment

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.350 align:middle line:10%
or opening, to really understand
the nature of that stone

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.530 align:middle line:10%
and you personally, and
your deep astrology,

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.370 align:middle line:10%
and what's happening
astrologically at that time.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Because a stone that
can help you in one

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.490 align:middle line:84%
period can actually have a
diminishing effect when it's

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.996 align:middle line:90%
badly aspected astrologically.

00:11:12.996 --> 00:11:14.670 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: It does.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.330 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of systems that
are really intimately connected

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:19.130 align:middle line:90%
to this.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.338 align:middle line:84%
Ayurvedic astrology, or the
practice of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:21.338 --> 00:11:24.980 align:middle line:84%
They work with gemstones
very, very in-depth,

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.059 align:middle line:84%
and so they're very much about
trying to find those auspicious

00:11:28.059 --> 00:11:30.350 align:middle line:84%
and inauspicious gems for
different times for different

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.540 align:middle line:84%
people and it's
highly personalized,

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:84%
down to the amount of
the stone you're wearing,

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.421 align:middle line:84%
the metal on which it's
set, the ring on which--

00:11:37.421 --> 00:11:39.003 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The finger
on which it sits.

00:11:39.003 --> 00:11:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Exactly.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So there are a lot of
different influences

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:43.880 align:middle line:84%
that different systems
take into account.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And then other systems
are a little bit lighter

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.210 align:middle line:90%
on the astrological information.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, you have to find
a practice that works for you.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.860 align:middle line:84%
If consulting an ephemeris every
couple of hours to change rocks

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.971 align:middle line:84%
is becoming too
much then it's time

00:11:57.971 --> 00:11:59.720 align:middle line:84%
to find something a
little more practical.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:02.540 align:middle line:10%
So let's go into
the stones and we're

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.220 align:middle line:10%
going to-- your journey in
your book starts with obsidian.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.020 align:middle line:90%
Why obsidian?

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.811 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
look at it and say,

00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:10.550 align:middle line:90%
but it's an inky, black stone.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:11.759 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about obsidian.

00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Well, if
we think about it

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.890 align:middle line:84%
being an inky, black stone, if
we start our spiritual path,

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:17.480 align:middle line:90%
we tend to start it in the dark.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.100 align:middle line:90%
We don't have all the answers.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.904 align:middle line:84%
And obsidian perfectly
reflects that.

00:12:20.904 --> 00:12:22.820 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea for the
book came to me one day

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:27.099 align:middle line:84%
because I was driving to work
in my previous job and I had a--

00:12:27.099 --> 00:12:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
your previous job?

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: I worked in retail.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:90%
I worked in management.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.280 align:middle line:84%
I was climbing the
corporate ladder

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.320 align:middle line:84%
and when things were good
they were really good.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.695 align:middle line:84%
And about the time
I was writing,

00:12:34.695 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:90%
things were really good.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And when it was not so much
I took that leap of faith

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.971 align:middle line:90%
to just focus on the writing.

00:12:40.971 --> 00:12:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So anyway, you
were driving to work one day.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.595 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: I was
driving to work.

00:12:44.595 --> 00:12:47.167 align:middle line:84%
I always had a stone either
around my neck, in my pocket,

00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:49.250 align:middle line:84%
in my hand in some cases
because they would become

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.140 align:middle line:84%
these sort of
talismans, these tools

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.240 align:middle line:90%
for getting through each day.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And that particular day
my ally was obsidian.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept
thinking to myself,

00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't really matter
where you go in the world,

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:84%
obsidian has been used
for the same things

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.110 align:middle line:84%
if we look at the
archaeological record,

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:06.650 align:middle line:84%
for cutting edges and
reflective surfaces.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:07.550 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.870 align:middle line:90%
So it's pretty much universal.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:10.670 align:middle line:90%
It's archetypal.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:11.990 align:middle line:90%
It's prototypic.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's been kind of
the seed that was planted.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And I started to work
with obsidian in this way.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at the
symbolism of those spear points

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.360 align:middle line:84%
or arrowheads, the
sharp edges, they really

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.220 align:middle line:84%
teach us to be more
incisive with our mind.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.222 align:middle line:84%
They hone our mind to
cut through the dross

00:13:28.222 --> 00:13:29.180 align:middle line:90%
of the world around us.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.380 align:middle line:90%
Cut through materialism.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.804 align:middle line:84%
Cut through illusion
and separation.

00:13:32.804 --> 00:13:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And then those
reflective surfaces

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.595 align:middle line:84%
like the ancient
obsidian mirrors

00:13:35.595 --> 00:13:39.617 align:middle line:84%
that you find in Mesoamerica
and the Anatolian Peninsula,

00:13:39.617 --> 00:13:41.450 align:middle line:84%
they're really showing
us our shadow selves.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Used for
magical purposes.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:43.806 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Absolutely.

00:13:43.806 --> 00:13:47.710 align:middle line:84%
But you know for many
purposes, on one side

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.990 align:middle line:90%
it's very practical.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.060 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
fancy mirrors, so when

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.280 align:middle line:84%
they could polish a
stone and see themselves

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.950 align:middle line:84%
for the first time
it was very magical,

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.590 align:middle line:90%
but it was also very real world.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.440 align:middle line:84%
They looked at the stones
in a very practical sense.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Their what we might
call magic and mystery

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:08.150 align:middle line:84%
was the everyday to
the ancient people.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And you say that obsidian
has a direct correlation

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.500 align:middle line:84%
to the afterlife
and the underworld.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.890 align:middle line:84%
So let's speak about its
value there, because we often

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:90%
are fearful of these things.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: For sure.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.150 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at
these obsidian mirrors,

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:26.060 align:middle line:84%
when we gaze into them, we
don't see a perfect reflection.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:84%
We see this sort of dark,
shadowy, misty image

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.960 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And so it kind of represents
what's on the other side.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not a perfect
reflection of this world.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.240 align:middle line:84%
It's something less
physical, less tangible,

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.830 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more formless.

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And so we can use obsidian as
a tool for piercing that veil,

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.790 align:middle line:90%
for crossing the other side.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's for divination
like scrying or crystal gazing

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.360 align:middle line:84%
or for some sort of
shamanic journeying

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.720 align:middle line:84%
to receive some sort of wisdom
from the ancestral realm

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.610 align:middle line:84%
or the other spirits
that are out there.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And certainly it's been
used in grave goods

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.470 align:middle line:84%
as a funerary offering
because in many cultures

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.320 align:middle line:84%
it was believed to be
like travel insurance

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.090 align:middle line:90%
to the afterlife.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did they use
obsidian in ancient Egypt?

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Ancient Egypt, there
wasn't a whole lot of obsidian

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.150 align:middle line:84%
there because it wasn't
really a volcanic region,

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:18.365 align:middle line:84%
but it was occasionally
used for like inlay

00:15:18.365 --> 00:15:22.010 align:middle line:84%
in the eyes of statues and
a handful of other things.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Certainly it had its own
talismanic properties,

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.280 align:middle line:84%
but they tended to work
more with the stones

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.650 align:middle line:90%
that they had greater access to.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.960 align:middle line:84%
So some of the earliest
emerald mines in the world

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.510 align:middle line:90%
were in ancient Egypt.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.077 align:middle line:84%
Certainly things like
turquoise, agate, lots

00:15:36.077 --> 00:15:37.160 align:middle line:90%
of other wonderful things.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.118 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lapis lazuli.

00:15:38.118 --> 00:15:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Which we'll talk
about that as well.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and crystal.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Yes.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.500 align:middle line:90%
Lots and lots of quartz.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.041 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You say
another name for it

00:15:45.041 --> 00:15:46.410 align:middle line:90%
is called the smoking mirror.

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:46.950 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Yes.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.074 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's kind
of what you said earlier,

00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:52.180 align:middle line:84%
that it's reflecting somewhat
these distorted perceptions

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:52.980 align:middle line:90%
of self.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Absolutely.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.032 align:middle line:84%
So when we work with obsidian
in our own spiritual practice,

00:15:57.032 --> 00:15:58.740 align:middle line:84%
our own healing
practice, it's showing us

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.390 align:middle line:84%
the areas of ourselves
that still need resolution.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Those maybe fractured aspects
of our heart and mind.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.900 align:middle line:84%
The things we sweep
under the rug.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And as we begin to
use obsidian to look

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.280 align:middle line:84%
at these parts of
ourselves honestly,

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:16.020 align:middle line:84%
we begin to embrace this process
of fracturing, not as becoming

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.240 align:middle line:84%
broken but revealing the
structure that's within.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like when the ancient
lapidary artists would create

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
these arrowheads and
mirrors they would chip them

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:24.770 align:middle line:90%
down, flake them off.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And so piece by piece
it's coming undone.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's revealing
something more perfect

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.290 align:middle line:90%
that's already within.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you
continue in your book

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:84%
by saying that this is allowing
us to release the deepest fear.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And the deepest fear is
the unknown, or the void,

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.450 align:middle line:84%
or the sense that we
would cease to exist.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Exactly.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you talk
about that a little?

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Sure.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.390 align:middle line:84%
So most fear that we
experience doesn't

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.420 align:middle line:84%
come from our authentic self,
the true soul or spirit self,

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:90%
it comes from ego.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And ego is a really
necessary tool

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:02.797 align:middle line:84%
for navigating the 3-D world,
but the ego is not really

00:17:02.797 --> 00:17:03.630 align:middle line:90%
looking out for you.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.050 align:middle line:84%
It's only looking
out for itself.

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And when we misidentify
with the ego

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:08.700 align:middle line:84%
we begin to believe
these fears are really

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.829 align:middle line:84%
about our own well-being
and they're not.

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:14.849 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes down to
it, the idea of uncertainty

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:16.705 align:middle line:84%
is the ego kind of
pushing back and saying,

00:17:16.705 --> 00:17:19.079 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's going to
happen to me if you do this.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So it gets really uncertain
about obviously dangerous

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.940 align:middle line:84%
things, but also really
beautiful things too.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Because when we experience
unconditional love for example,

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:84%
there are no
limitations on that.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And ego thrives; in
fact its whole existence

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:31.830 align:middle line:90%
is predicated upon limitation.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.050 align:middle line:90%
And control.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.010 align:middle line:90%
Addiction.

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.400 align:middle line:90%
Control.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.930 align:middle line:10%
And in healing, you
say that obsidian

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.470 align:middle line:10%
can be used to
release blockages,

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:46.560 align:middle line:10%
to release some of the
tightness in the body.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And when you say that,
being used in what way?

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Are you talking about
almost like hands-on,

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:55.514 align:middle line:84%
the use of stones in
massage or body work or how?

00:17:55.514 --> 00:17:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: All of the above.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's something that we
could do through meditation,

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.740 align:middle line:84%
through contemplation, by
wearing or carrying the stone.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we get
a lot more focused

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:84%
use when we are placing
it very intentionally.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness is really
the biggest healer here.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And gemstones themselves
are only the catalysts.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:17.115 align:middle line:84%
So if wearing it is enough
to catalyze that reaction in

00:18:17.115 --> 00:18:18.174 align:middle line:90%
you then go for it.

00:18:18.174 --> 00:18:19.590 align:middle line:84%
But we can also
use them in things

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:20.740 align:middle line:90%
like body work and massage.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.240 align:middle line:84%
We can lay them on the body and
use ornate, elaborate layouts.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.030 align:middle line:84%
But whatever we're
doing, it just

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.920 align:middle line:84%
needs to involve
our whole presence.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.390 align:middle line:84%
We have to bring our
whole heart into whatever

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.310 align:middle line:84%
it is that we do with
crystals or we don't get

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.130 align:middle line:90%
the benefit we're looking for.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because that's
a very pure relationship.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.670 align:middle line:84%
It can't be half-assed
so to speak.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Exactly.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.170 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: One of the
things you talk about too--

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.850 align:middle line:10%
we only think of
obsidian as being

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.790 align:middle line:10%
black like this
beautiful obsidian

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:48.510 align:middle line:10%
in front of us, this sphere.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.180 align:middle line:90%
But it's not, right?

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.370 align:middle line:84%
So what colors does
obsidian come in,

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and does it work the same
way if it's not showing us

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.230 align:middle line:90%
that inky, black void?

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: You know,
on the one hand

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:84%
because the void also
comes from its structure

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.780 align:middle line:84%
or lack thereof in this case,
obsidian is not a mineral.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not a crystal.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.680 align:middle line:84%
It has no regularity in
its internal structure.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.080 align:middle line:84%
If we were to slice it
thin and magnify it,

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.300 align:middle line:84%
we would see what we
call short range order.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.950 align:middle line:84%
We would look at a
cluster of molecules

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.270 align:middle line:90%
and they resemble the crystal.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.937 align:middle line:84%
And they don't link
up to anything else.

00:19:16.937 --> 00:19:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So it's chaotic.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.020 align:middle line:90%
We're chaotic inside.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Exactly.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.924 align:middle line:84%
So some of those energies that
we experience with obsidian

00:19:22.924 --> 00:19:24.840 align:middle line:84%
are born out of its
structure and composition.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's more
or less the same,

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.830 align:middle line:84%
no matter what color or
formation it comes in.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.731 align:middle line:84%
But like we were
talking about quartz

00:19:30.731 --> 00:19:32.730 align:middle line:84%
from different locations,
those different colors

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:36.815 align:middle line:84%
and types of obsidian all
have different personalities.

00:19:36.815 --> 00:19:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So something like
an Apache Tear,

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.850 align:middle line:84%
which is actually quite
transparent when backlit,

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.280 align:middle line:84%
that's going to have a very
different characteristic

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.840 align:middle line:84%
on some level than your
standard black obsidian.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And the rainbow and
sheen obsidians,

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.720 align:middle line:84%
which, when polished, reveal
these shimmering colors,

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.535 align:middle line:84%
are full of light in a
way you don't expect out

00:19:54.535 --> 00:19:55.410 align:middle line:90%
of such a dark stone.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So wouldn't it have
a very different impact on you

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.191 align:middle line:90%
then?

00:19:58.191 --> 00:20:00.648 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: You know, it's almost
like theme and variations.

00:20:00.648 --> 00:20:02.310 align:middle line:84%
They embody the
same theme and then

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.670 align:middle line:84%
they add something new to
it from those minute changes

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.069 align:middle line:90%
in its chemistry.

00:20:07.069 --> 00:20:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
a person-- if it

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:12.412 align:middle line:84%
is a stone whose structure
is more chaotic, how

00:20:12.412 --> 00:20:14.370 align:middle line:84%
does that work with a
person if they're already

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:15.360 align:middle line:90%
in a state of chaos?

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.504 align:middle line:90%
Will it enhance the chaos, then?

00:20:17.504 --> 00:20:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: I like to
think of it as kind

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.930 align:middle line:84%
of trying to ride
the eye of the storm,

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.870 align:middle line:84%
right there on that
wall of the eye--

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:25.520 align:middle line:84%
we get a lot of
hurricanes in Florida

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.030 align:middle line:84%
so this is familiar
imagery for me--

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:30.850 align:middle line:84%
but it's where the winds
are the most intense.

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.830 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
peace within that.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So if we can just make
it through that wall,

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:36.899 align:middle line:90%
then there's stillness.

00:20:36.899 --> 00:20:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And obsidian really tries to
help us push through that.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Helps us lean into
the discomfort,

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.290 align:middle line:84%
because then once we do
that we stop struggling

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:45.464 align:middle line:90%
and we find peace.

00:20:45.464 --> 00:20:47.380 align:middle line:84%
The only reason really
to have those struggles

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.354 align:middle line:84%
is because the ego is
saying, oh I don't like this.

00:20:51.354 --> 00:20:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't
know the outcome here.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Exactly.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And if we can relax
into the uncertainty

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.130 align:middle line:90%
then miracles happen.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Miracles are the natural
order of the universe.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And we don't get them when
our hearts are closed.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason
our hearts are closed

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.198 align:middle line:84%
is because the ego is
telling us to close

00:21:05.198 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:90%
them to protect itself.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So before we close out
the subject of obsidian,

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.170 align:middle line:84%
you have a really pretty
piece of green obsidian there.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.310 align:middle line:90%
Now, where was that grown?

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: So this is
formed in Mali in Africa.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.250 align:middle line:84%
So most of the time when we see
bright gem-y-colored obsidians

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.566 align:middle line:84%
they're not obsidian at
all, they're man-made glass.

00:21:23.566 --> 00:21:24.690 align:middle line:90%
So something like this is--

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:24.910 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, this almost
looks like man-made glass.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.880 align:middle line:84%
It almost looks like an emerald
when you look at the light

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.680 align:middle line:90%
through it.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.640 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's obsidian.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: It is.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It would seem to have
no similarity in its structure

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.934 align:middle line:90%
to this black opaque one.

00:21:36.934 --> 00:21:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Well,
if we magnify it,

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.183 align:middle line:84%
the only difference is
it's got fewer metals

00:21:40.183 --> 00:21:42.280 align:middle line:90%
in it making it much less dark.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.990 align:middle line:84%
But it's the same
silica base that makes

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.979 align:middle line:90%
it glass in the first place.

00:21:45.979 --> 00:21:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's beautiful.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, speaking of green,
let's move on to jade.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:49.900 align:middle line:90%
Are you done?

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:50.820 align:middle line:90%
Are we done with obsidian?

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Sure, yeah.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
move on to jade,

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and the stone of immortality
is what you call it, right?

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
first its historic use.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.120 align:middle line:84%
In China in particular because
when you think of China

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.410 align:middle line:84%
it's almost
synonymous with jade.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.360 align:middle line:84%
So jade in traditional
Chinese medicine

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.290 align:middle line:84%
has been used for
protecting the vitality,

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:13.330 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the
kidney meridian,

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.700 align:middle line:90%
which rules our longevity.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.380 align:middle line:84%
It's what holds
our vital essence,

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.150 align:middle line:84%
our jing, sort of like our
life force if you will.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And so when we work
with jade, it's

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.760 align:middle line:84%
meant to support our overall
well-being on many levels.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.340 align:middle line:84%
People use it in China
to represent immortality,

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:32.550 align:middle line:84%
good fortune, wealth, luck, as
well as fidelity in marriage.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.881 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of a
catch-all kind of stone,

00:22:34.881 --> 00:22:36.380 align:middle line:84%
and that's because
it works with us.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.921 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't there a lot of
human projection on this stone

00:22:38.921 --> 00:22:40.859 align:middle line:90%
or is this historically valid?

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Well you
know, here's the thing.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:84%
When we look at what the
real mechanism is behind it,

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.920 align:middle line:84%
the real mechanism
is that jade gets us

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.440 align:middle line:90%
in touch with the eternal.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And the only way we can do
that is in the present moment.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Right here, in the
now is where we have

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.340 align:middle line:90%
the experience of eternity.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And if we totally surrender
to that, if we relax into it

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and embrace it, then the
natural extension of that

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:84%
is to receive things
like good fortune.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, timing is
always right if you're

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.710 align:middle line:90%
right here in the now.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:13.180 align:middle line:84%
We experience more joy, more
wealth, more well-being,

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:17.020 align:middle line:84%
because we're willing to receive
it if we're here and now.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's the basic
message of jade.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.010 align:middle line:84%
It does this by
bringing us peace.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And if we have a peaceful heart,
a peaceful mind, then how can

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.750 align:middle line:90%
we not have good fortune?

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is it
in its structure that

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.170 align:middle line:84%
would align with or
equal a connection

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.300 align:middle line:84%
with eternity and
eternal forces?

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: So jade
is very, very tough.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.800 align:middle line:84%
It actually is two
different substances.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.670 align:middle line:84%
We have jadeite which is the
more precious variety, and then

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:43.690 align:middle line:90%
the nephrite.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So both of them are
monoclinic minerals.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.430 align:middle line:84%
They've got very
similar compositions

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:84%
but they've got
different structures.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So the nephrite
version is made out

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.410 align:middle line:84%
of these little fibers that are
sort of broken down and felted

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.420 align:middle line:84%
together in a big
twisted mass, just

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.580 align:middle line:90%
like you were felting wool.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And that makes it
very, very tenacious.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So even though its
hardness is not

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:84%
very high compared to diamond,
it's tougher than diamond,

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:11.260 align:middle line:84%
for example, because those
fibers are so well interlocked.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And the other
variety, jadeite, it's

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.920 align:middle line:90%
made of interlocking grains.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.030 align:middle line:90%
So a very similar effect.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.140 align:middle line:84%
It makes it a very
tenacious substance.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And so it withstands the
erosive nature of time itself.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So when we connect
to jade, we're

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.980 align:middle line:84%
touching a substance that
can be beaten down by time

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:27.940 align:middle line:90%
and still be here.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And imagine if you were a
very ancient artisan crafting

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.850 align:middle line:84%
a piece of jade with many
hundreds of man hours

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.260 align:middle line:90%
going into that.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.530 align:middle line:84%
When you passed away, your
work would last forever

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:40.570 align:middle line:90%
because you carved it into jade.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Also, the colors, when you're
looking at the color range,

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:90%
which is the jadeite?

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Is it the darker, more vibrant
grain, or the more dreamy,

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.750 align:middle line:90%
pastel grain?

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: It really just
depends on what's inside it.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.586 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
can be either one.

00:24:57.586 --> 00:24:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Either variety can show up.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:59.626 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Absolutely.

00:24:59.626 --> 00:25:02.151 align:middle line:84%
And jade actually spans
the full color spectrum.

00:25:02.151 --> 00:25:04.150 align:middle line:84%
The more precious jades
tend to be the jadeites.

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And they often have the
more saturated colors,

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.860 align:middle line:84%
but that's not a
hard and fast rule.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.630 align:middle line:84%
The most precious
jades today are

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.380 align:middle line:84%
things like the lavender
and purple jades.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
going to bring that up.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.580 align:middle line:90%
It's so beautiful.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: And then
also the bright imperial

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.089 align:middle line:84%
green which comes from
chromium in its presence.

00:25:21.089 --> 00:25:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Most of the darker greens
and even the more blue greens

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.512 align:middle line:90%
come from iron rather chromium.

00:25:26.512 --> 00:25:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would
think once you change--

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.553 align:middle line:90%
as we spoke about a minute ago--

00:25:29.553 --> 00:25:31.420 align:middle line:84%
but once you actually
change the color

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.570 align:middle line:84%
that's reflected in the stone
that that would subtly change

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:90%
its effects and properties too.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.071 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Yeah, very,
very subtly though.

00:25:38.071 --> 00:25:39.820 align:middle line:84%
If we were looking at
a transparent stone,

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.560 align:middle line:84%
like quartz for
example, if we had

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.159 align:middle line:84%
a one foot-by-one
foot-by-one foot cube of it,

00:25:44.159 --> 00:25:46.450 align:middle line:84%
the amount of iron it would
take to turn it to amethyst

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:47.980 align:middle line:84%
is so minuscule
that it's smaller

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.960 align:middle line:84%
than the amount in
a ballpoint pen.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.686 align:middle line:84%
So they are more alike
than they are different.

00:25:52.686 --> 00:25:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's true of most minerals
that come in different colors.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Their basic fundamental
note is the same regardless

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.600 align:middle line:84%
of what they look
like on the exterior.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interesting What
about the notion of sleeping?

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:09.350 align:middle line:84%
The Biomet company started out
their original sleeping mat

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.620 align:middle line:90%
was filled with jade.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.296 align:middle line:84%
And what would that
indicate sleeping on jade?

00:26:15.296 --> 00:26:16.420 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have one of those.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.682 align:middle line:90%
What would that feel like?

00:26:17.682 --> 00:26:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Jade is
this a wonderful stone

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.060 align:middle line:84%
for getting in touch with
that sort of shamanic

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.760 align:middle line:84%
or non-ordinary reality which is
often referred to as the dream

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.840 align:middle line:90%
time in different cultures.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So jade has this
dreamy quality to it,

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.460 align:middle line:84%
and if you can
imagine a stone that

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.270 align:middle line:84%
embodies that otherworldly
realm we visit in our dreams,

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.780 align:middle line:84%
then by sleeping atop it or
even just relaxing or meditating

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:84%
with it, then we have
this open doorway

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.152 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate access
to that other realm.

00:26:44.152 --> 00:26:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now they
use-- well, they

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:47.120 align:middle line:84%
started another one
I've heard about.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:47.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't have it.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.294 align:middle line:90%
But then they went to amethysts.

00:26:49.294 --> 00:26:51.210 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
that in a little bit

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.410 align:middle line:84%
and what happens when
you sleep on amethyst.

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:55.472 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you
sleep on stones in general?

00:26:55.472 --> 00:26:57.305 align:middle line:84%
But normally we don't
have that opportunity.

00:26:57.305 --> 00:26:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Absolutely.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.583 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think there are only
a few companies that actually

00:27:00.583 --> 00:27:03.510 align:middle line:84%
tumble stones and
you sleep on them so.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.620 align:middle line:84%
It is somewhat
limited in that way.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.550 align:middle line:84%
It's called also
the stone of heaven.

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Yes.

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.141 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is what
you just mentioned.

00:27:10.141 --> 00:27:11.290 align:middle line:90%
The dreamy stone.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:13.090 align:middle line:84%
So again, it has
what kind of effect

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.050 align:middle line:90%
on dream time and our dreams?

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: It really makes
our dreams a lot more vibrant

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.044 align:middle line:90%
and a lot more meaningful.

00:27:19.044 --> 00:27:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Dreams have lots of
different functions.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.001 align:middle line:84%
My personal belief is we have
different kinds of dreams

00:27:23.001 --> 00:27:25.840 align:middle line:84%
for different kinds of missions
that we might be experiencing.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.330 align:middle line:90%
And jade facilitates them all.

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:30.220 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that it
is believed to have

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.912 align:middle line:84%
been hacked from
an ancient rainbow

00:27:31.912 --> 00:27:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and fallen to the
Earth, and that's

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:35.730 align:middle line:84%
why it comes in so
many different colors,

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.470 align:middle line:84%
means that when
we work with jade

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.340 align:middle line:84%
it helps to elevate
our consciousness up

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.547 align:middle line:90%
towards that heavenly state.

00:27:40.547 --> 00:27:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Jade becomes the
doorway through which

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.720 align:middle line:90%
we access the heavenly realms.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.300 align:middle line:84%
It's born in the
depths of the Earth.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.400 align:middle line:84%
It has this really dense,
heavy quality to it

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.900 align:middle line:84%
so it's still very grounding and
nurturing from an earthy way.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.580 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of the bridge
between heaven and Earth.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we move from
obsidian and the ability

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:02.410 align:middle line:84%
to lean into or learn into
whatever our challenges are,

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:04.850 align:middle line:90%
the underworld and so forth.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going
into the opposite

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:07.540 align:middle line:90%
when we go to jade, right?

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.300 align:middle line:84%
It's elevating us into
the higher connection

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.044 align:middle line:90%
with we would say self as well.

00:28:12.044 --> 00:28:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Absolutely.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.168 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And do you find
that in your own experience

00:28:15.168 --> 00:28:16.600 align:middle line:90%
if you meditate with jade?

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.097 align:middle line:84%
Does it bring you into a
closer alliance with yourself?

00:28:19.097 --> 00:28:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: It really does.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.721 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the
structure of jade--

00:28:21.721 --> 00:28:23.200 align:middle line:84%
this is a really
fascinating thing.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So for a long time,
in different parts

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:28.030 align:middle line:84%
of the world, cultures that had
no contact with one another,

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:32.410 align:middle line:84%
jade has been used for repairing
our physical tissues for things

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:34.580 align:middle line:84%
like beauty and
wellness on many levels.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.610 align:middle line:84%
But if we look at nephrite
jade in particular,

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:38.290 align:middle line:84%
those interlocking
fibers actually

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:40.240 align:middle line:84%
resemble our own
collagen fibers,

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.850 align:middle line:84%
the things that help us
stay young, and kind of have

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:44.810 align:middle line:90%
our own immortal look to them.

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:47.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's really very
strongly associated

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.260 align:middle line:90%
with our presence here.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Not just our mental, emotional
sort of spiritual presence

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.370 align:middle line:84%
that we get through
that mechanism of peace,

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:55.820 align:middle line:90%
but also our physical body.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:59.761 align:middle line:84%
They help us to be more
present where we are right now.

00:28:59.761 --> 00:29:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's interesting,
because in the beauty industry

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.990 align:middle line:84%
I was gifted one of
these little jade face

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:08.900 align:middle line:84%
rollers, which it didn't have
any instructions with it.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.930 align:middle line:84%
I assume you just roll
it on your face, right?

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed afterward,
yes it's smooth

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and it's cool if
the room is cool,

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.720 align:middle line:84%
but there was an
enlivening kind of effect.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I just felt almost like a
tingling underneath the skin

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:24.979 align:middle line:90%
after rolling it.

00:29:24.979 --> 00:29:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Yeah, that's
that whole property

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:29.284 align:middle line:90%
of sympathetic resonance.

00:29:29.284 --> 00:29:30.700 align:middle line:84%
In medicine we
sometimes call it--

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.130 align:middle line:90%
especially energy medicine--

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:34.820 align:middle line:84%
like attracts like
or like heals like.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's that similar
structure between

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.926 align:middle line:84%
our own physical tissues
and the composition of jade.

00:29:39.926 --> 00:29:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what would
it be doing when it's

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.902 align:middle line:90%
making that tingling happen?

00:29:43.902 --> 00:29:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: I'd wager
that you're probably

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:47.330 align:middle line:84%
more sensitive than
the average person.

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:50.680 align:middle line:84%
I use a jade roller
and I don't necessarily

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.880 align:middle line:90%
get that tingling sensation.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.330 align:middle line:84%
But it's talking
to your tissues.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's waking
up the processes.

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And if it's just under
the skin, and you just

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.740 align:middle line:84%
said it has a similar
matrix to collagen,

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.140 align:middle line:84%
it must be speaking to the
collagen under the skin.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Absolutely.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.281 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is this
something that's

00:30:07.281 --> 00:30:10.630 align:middle line:84%
been used in Asia for
throughout the time using jade

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:11.450 align:middle line:90%
on the skin?

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Absolutely.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Jade, whether in rollers
or just smooth stones,

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.420 align:middle line:90%
it's a very, very popular tool.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What they
maybe give massages with?

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:22.610 align:middle line:90%
With jade?

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just listening to it I
feel some resonance with that.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:29.590 align:middle line:84%
That sounds really beautiful
for awakening the body.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.115 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's also associated
with mercury you say.

00:30:32.115 --> 00:30:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: It can be
from time to time.

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:36.140 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the culture
is a big part of it.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.270 align:middle line:10%
But jade is often
associated with this sort

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:40.580 align:middle line:10%
of airy kind of quality.

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:43.860 align:middle line:10%
In Mesoamerica especially
like little pieces of jade

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:46.070 align:middle line:10%
would be tied to statues;
the mouths of statues;

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:49.450 align:middle line:10%
under the mouths of masks,
and it represented the breath.

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:52.700 align:middle line:84%
So that particular
planet Mercury

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.890 align:middle line:84%
has this very strong
airy element to it

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:58.670 align:middle line:84%
so it can give us a sort
of mercurial whimsy,

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:00.860 align:middle line:84%
which we only experience
if we're living in the now,

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.480 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.490 align:middle line:84%
It all ties back
into that mechanism

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:06.770 align:middle line:84%
that jade has to bring
us into the eternity,

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:08.390 align:middle line:90%
right here, right now.

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And ironically,
though it opens our channels up

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.570 align:middle line:84%
to the higher, finer
frequencies within ourselves,

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:17.450 align:middle line:84%
it's also been used for battle
because of its toughness.

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Talk about that
bit of its history.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: So in many
parts of the world

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.850 align:middle line:84%
it's been cut into things
like axe heads and celts

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and other things that obviously
were meant to cut or pound

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.840 align:middle line:90%
or smash.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.539 align:middle line:84%
But I think all of these are
really sort of a side effect.

00:31:33.539 --> 00:31:34.580 align:middle line:90%
One of the utility of it.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:35.730 align:middle line:90%
It's very durable.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:38.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you can cut a mallet
or an axe head out of jade

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:40.730 align:middle line:84%
it's going to last
a good long while.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:42.920 align:middle line:84%
But even the clubs and
other things, they've

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.420 align:middle line:90%
taken on a more ceremonial use.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Like the Maori use clubs,
it's called a mere,

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and they sort of are a
symbol of your own divinity,

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.305 align:middle line:84%
your own authority, your
own descent from heaven

00:31:55.305 --> 00:31:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and that's why you have this
ability to have stewardship,

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.990 align:middle line:84%
not only over your own life
but over those of others.

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:05.090 align:middle line:84%
So the base, gross kind
of real gruesome symbolism

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:07.052 align:middle line:84%
that comes from
that battle imagery

00:32:07.052 --> 00:32:08.510 align:middle line:84%
has been transformed
into something

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:12.070 align:middle line:84%
that's a lot more refined
today even in tribal societies.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Another powerful
correlation is the jade dragon,

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and oftentimes jade is
carved into dragon in Asia.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.660 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Yeah, and
not just in Asia.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.450 align:middle line:84%
In Mesoamerica we have
the plumed serpent

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:24.230 align:middle line:90%
or the feathered serpent.

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:25.280 align:middle line:90%
We have these sort of--

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In jade?

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:26.930 align:middle line:90%
Carved in jade?

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: In jade,
among other things.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And not just dragons, all sorts
of other otherworldly beings.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.992 align:middle line:84%
In New Zealand again
they have the taniwha,

00:32:34.992 --> 00:32:36.450 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of
like a sea serpent

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:38.450 align:middle line:90%
they'll carve out of jade.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:41.180 align:middle line:84%
They have hei-tiki, which is
sort of this ancestral being

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.300 align:middle line:84%
that looks kind of like
a cross between a sea

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.460 align:middle line:90%
monster and a person.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And he's some sort of
other worldly being.

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So the whole idea of this jade
dragon or this jade immortal

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.440 align:middle line:84%
being is here to be
your guide, your helper

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.460 align:middle line:90%
on the spiritual path.

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.590 align:middle line:84%
When we really
connect with jade,

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:59.840 align:middle line:84%
we recognize that
we, as human beings,

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:04.310 align:middle line:84%
are part of a bigger design
and we are programmed or set

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:08.250 align:middle line:84%
into a world where we have
infinite potential and untold

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:09.050 align:middle line:90%
help.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.008 align:middle line:84%
So the jade dragon is
there to stand beside you

00:33:11.008 --> 00:33:12.800 align:middle line:84%
and walk you on
that spiritual path

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.670 align:middle line:84%
as you ascend
towards the heavens.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in the
process of this refinement,

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:19.700 align:middle line:84%
it's supposed to slow down
the aging process you say?

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Well, that's the
belief in Chinese medicine.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.710 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the
function of its relationship

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:26.630 align:middle line:84%
with the kidney meridian,
that does slow down

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:28.421 align:middle line:84%
the aging process, that
relationship with--

00:33:28.421 --> 00:33:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The kidney,
it stays healthy.

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Exactly.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And we look at that
relationship with collagen,

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean obviously if we
retain our collagen,

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.720 align:middle line:84%
if it's not breaking
down as we age,

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.390 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
look very youthful.

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:41.462 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any final thoughts
on the lovely stone of jade?

00:33:41.462 --> 00:33:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: I think that
pretty much sums it up.

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Jade means so much
to so many people.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, there are a
few other things I wrote down

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:47.900 align:middle line:90%
but we have more stones--

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.233 align:middle line:84%
we have five more stones to
get through in limited time.

00:33:50.233 --> 00:33:52.880 align:middle line:10%
Lapis lazuli, the
all-seeing eye, prehistoric.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that and
its uses historically,

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:58.670 align:middle line:84%
and what it can still offer into
our lives if we play with it.

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: So lapis
is a metamorphic rock.

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Again, not a single mineral
species but actually

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.350 align:middle line:90%
an aggregate of several.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So we've got the dark blue
lazurites, the golden flecks

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:10.489 align:middle line:84%
that resemble stars
made of iron pyrite,

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and these wisps and
veils of white calcite

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:15.199 align:middle line:84%
and a handful of other
accessory minerals.

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And to ancient people, they
would see these fragmented

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:21.710 align:middle line:84%
pieces of earth and they looked
exactly like the night sky.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:23.659 align:middle line:84%
And so it's always
sort of represented

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:26.420 align:middle line:84%
this internal longing
we have to return

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.270 align:middle line:84%
to our origin among the
stars with the divine

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:31.100 align:middle line:90%
to own that birthright.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's been used as a
symbol of royalty; of power.

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:37.489 align:middle line:84%
We think of royal blue and it's
that same ultramarine color

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:38.750 align:middle line:90%
that lapis is.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And when we work with
a stone like lapis,

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.730 align:middle line:84%
when we get in touch with our
soul's origins from the stars

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:46.530 align:middle line:84%
themselves, we have this
gift of sovereignty,

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:49.710 align:middle line:84%
this ability to decide what's
happening in your life.

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And we only get that by being
really conscious, really

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.350 align:middle line:84%
present, and deciding that
we've kind of had enough

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:56.510 align:middle line:90%
of the world beating us up.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:00.200 align:middle line:84%
So lapis is this wonderful
tool for opening our mind.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is it
actually harmonizes our heart

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:05.030 align:middle line:90%
and our mind together.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:07.102 align:middle line:84%
And in so doing, it
allows us to have

00:35:07.102 --> 00:35:08.810 align:middle line:84%
this heart-centered
awareness where we're

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:12.740 align:middle line:84%
no longer in competition, we're
not experiencing separation

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.470 align:middle line:84%
between one another, but
also with source, with God,

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:17.810 align:middle line:84%
with the primal
energies of all that is.

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:19.936 align:middle line:90%


00:35:19.936 --> 00:35:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you look
at all these stones--

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:25.000 align:middle line:84%
this is a brief aside,
but it's still relative,

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.230 align:middle line:90%
relates to this--

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:29.080 align:middle line:84%
and that is, all the different
books written on stones,

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.420 align:middle line:84%
you just look it up, you
get this much information,

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.850 align:middle line:90%
this is what it means, period.

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:36.610 align:middle line:84%
How useful do you
personally find

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:38.980 align:middle line:90%
most of the gemstone books?

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.140 align:middle line:90%
Is it more surface affect?

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Do you find them useful
at all considering

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:45.490 align:middle line:84%
your own relationship
with stones?

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: I am a book lover.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.999 align:middle line:84%
So long before I
started writing books

00:35:48.999 --> 00:35:50.290 align:middle line:90%
I was collecting crystal books.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's a point in
all of our lives, all

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:55.360 align:middle line:84%
of our journeys with
the mineral kingdom

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:59.170 align:middle line:84%
where all we're really ready for
is that sort of cursory glance

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:00.520 align:middle line:90%
at what a stone does.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.640 align:middle line:84%
But after a while,
I started wanting

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.290 align:middle line:90%
to go a whole lot deeper.

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And so with that,
I had to do a lot

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.121 align:middle line:90%
of my own independent research.

00:36:10.121 --> 00:36:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And that was where
I started to look

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:13.960 align:middle line:84%
at things like the
composition, the morphology,

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.630 align:middle line:84%
the inner world of
the mineral kingdom

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:17.060 align:middle line:90%
to get a lot of that depth.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So I still pick up the
quick and easy sorts

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.052 align:middle line:84%
of dictionaries of
stones' properties

00:36:21.052 --> 00:36:23.051 align:middle line:84%
every now and then,
especially if it's something

00:36:23.051 --> 00:36:24.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm totally unfamiliar with.

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But the first thing
I'll do before I

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:27.790 align:middle line:84%
get there is look up its
composition, its structure,

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:30.130 align:middle line:84%
and sit with it
based on the ideas

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:32.290 align:middle line:84%
that I have been able to
formulate from real world

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.748 align:middle line:84%
experience with things that
might be similar in composition

00:36:34.748 --> 00:36:36.400 align:middle line:90%
or structure.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.221 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not to be specific,
but I'm going to be specific.

00:36:39.221 --> 00:36:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most-- one of
the most well-known-- if you

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.577 align:middle line:84%
go to the Tucson Gem
and Mineral Show you're

00:36:43.577 --> 00:36:46.000 align:middle line:84%
going to see "The Crystal
Bible" everywhere.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.309 align:middle line:84%
And I always thought that
was a lovely little primer.

00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
get your take on that.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.230 align:middle line:84%
For people who are just
entering that world,

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:55.590 align:middle line:84%
that can be a really
good little ally

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:59.290 align:middle line:84%
to just get the very basic
principles of stones.

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:02.442 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'm asking if
you see it the same way.

00:37:02.442 --> 00:37:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Well, here's
what the deal is.

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:06.550 align:middle line:84%
With any book on crystals,
especially the shorter

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and sweeter it is, it represents
one person's relationship

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:09.820 align:middle line:90%
with a stone.

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: One
person's relationship

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:13.300 align:middle line:90%
with one example of one stone.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.520 align:middle line:84%
So they're good,
but we always have

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.980 align:middle line:84%
to bear in mind that any
words or reading, whether they

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:20.590 align:middle line:84%
are mine or someone
else's, they reflect

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:22.175 align:middle line:90%
that author's point of view.

00:37:22.175 --> 00:37:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:27.130 align:middle line:84%
If you go online-- if you just
go Google spiritual meaning

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:31.070 align:middle line:84%
of jade, for example, it's
a wide swath of material.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: It sure is.

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So that's--

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.940 align:middle line:84%
I guess the point is,
you're speaking about them

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.240 align:middle line:84%
in specific ways and this
is your internal knowledge

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.970 align:middle line:84%
that's coming through, having
worked with them, having

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:46.240 align:middle line:84%
studied the history of them,
having studied the stone

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.190 align:middle line:90%
lattice itself.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is, in a sense, a
researched point of view

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:54.850 align:middle line:84%
on what these stones
are about, and not just

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:57.210 align:middle line:84%
your personal
perception of them.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Doing scientific
work with the stones,

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:03.080 align:middle line:84%
understanding their makeup on
a really fundamental level.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.570 align:middle line:84%
But even still,
I'm an avid reader,

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I've read hundreds of books
on the properties of crystals.

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I've read dozens of books
on just their historical

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and sort of scientific
values as well.

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So when I write I
tend to call upon all

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:18.730 align:middle line:84%
those different perspectives
and marry them together and try

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:20.800 align:middle line:84%
to find the most
universal ideas, which is

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.979 align:middle line:90%
why these are stone archetypes.

00:38:22.979 --> 00:38:25.270 align:middle line:84%
They mean the same to all of
us no matter where we are.

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:27.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about one
person's relationship.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.620 align:middle line:84%
It's about the relationship
of the mineral kingdom

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:30.980 align:middle line:90%
and the human kingdom together.

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Just to finish up on lapis,
let's talk about some

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:40.070 align:middle line:84%
of the uses and the more lasting
works of art in the world.

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Yeah,
so lapis has been

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:48.280 align:middle line:84%
used for carving, for inlay,
for making pigment for paint.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.564 align:middle line:84%
Lapis has a lot of
eye-related imagery.

00:38:50.564 --> 00:38:52.480 align:middle line:84%
There's a really famous
statue I just recently

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.010 align:middle line:90%
visited in the Louvre that--

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which one?

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: I'll butcher the name
because it's a Persian name.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:01.930 align:middle line:84%
But it's a white marble
statue with lapis eyes.

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:07.550 align:middle line:10%
And the same lapis eyes we see
in things like Mesopotamian art

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:09.370 align:middle line:10%
and Egyptian art.

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Even in ancient Egypt they
would make eye makeup out

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.210 align:middle line:90%
of powdered lapis.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:16.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's got this strong
connection to vision, insight,

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of represents
the perspective

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:22.360 align:middle line:84%
that we gain when we
recognize and claim our place

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.372 align:middle line:90%
among the heavens.

00:39:23.372 --> 00:39:25.330 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden the whole
world opens up to us.

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:28.210 align:middle line:84%
We see it all at once from
that heightened perspective,

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:29.860 align:middle line:84%
that new vantage
point rather than

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.400 align:middle line:90%
the limited 3-D perspective.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's strongly related
to our internal vision,

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.050 align:middle line:84%
our psychic vision
and intuition.

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's also aligned
oftentimes in very simple books

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.030 align:middle line:90%
with the six chakra, right?

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Which room in the
Louvre were you in?

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Which collection, which era?

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:51.470 align:middle line:90%
So someone could find that.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:54.121 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: That was in the Near
Eastern and Middle Eastern art.

00:39:54.121 --> 00:39:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, because
that just sounds stunning.

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:57.453 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I've ever seen it.

00:39:57.453 --> 00:39:58.951 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Yeah, it's beautiful.

00:39:58.951 --> 00:39:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, well good.

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Next time at the Louvre then.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: For sure.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The next one
we're going to is emerald.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.680 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
grail and the Tablet.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.450 align:middle line:90%
Why is it called that?

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: So in mythology,
in folklore and history,

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:13.930 align:middle line:84%
the archetypal
roles of the emerald

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:18.910 align:middle line:84%
we see this idea of the Holy
Grail, some vessel or cup,

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:21.730 align:middle line:84%
sometimes a plate or a dish
that was carved from an emerald.

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes this
emerald is described

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:27.130 align:middle line:84%
as being the same stone
that was in Lucifer's crown

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:28.720 align:middle line:90%
when he was cast out of heaven.

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Archangel Michael struck
it and the emerald fell.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.516 align:middle line:84%
Was claimed by the
Queen of Sheba,

00:40:33.516 --> 00:40:35.140 align:middle line:84%
later given to King
Solomon, eventually

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.890 align:middle line:84%
becomes the grail
of the Last Supper.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:40.260 align:middle line:84%
But really, the
symbolism of the grail,

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:45.100 align:middle line:84%
especially if you look at
Eschenbach's "Parzival,"

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.580 align:middle line:84%
his retelling of it, you see the
Grail is this really powerful

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.080 align:middle line:90%
image of the divine feminine.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:55.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the sort of vessel in which
all the great alchemical work

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:56.510 align:middle line:90%
takes place.

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And in the Tale of
the Emerald Tablet,

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:00.670 align:middle line:84%
we have this little tract,
this little document

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:03.160 align:middle line:84%
that's been traded from
culture to culture and century

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.859 align:middle line:84%
to century, with lots of
commentary written on it.

00:41:05.859 --> 00:41:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Even Sir Isaac Newton
wrote his own version of it

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.490 align:middle line:90%
and provided his own commentary.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:12.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the main steps of
the alchemical process,

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and it's said to be
inscribed upon an emerald.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:19.150 align:middle line:84%
So emerald is deeply associated
with the idea of alchemy,

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:21.240 align:middle line:84%
of transforming a base
state, a leaden state,

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:25.540 align:middle line:84%
into a spiritually more rarefied
state or a golden state.

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's there to show us
that the way to true alchemy

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:29.840 align:middle line:90%
is through the heart.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:35.050 align:middle line:84%
If we look at that beautiful,
radiant green color, as well as

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:38.050 align:middle line:84%
its composition, its morphology,
that same hexagonal shape

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:43.420 align:middle line:84%
is closely associated with the
ancient symbol of the heart

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:46.600 align:middle line:90%
chakra, anahata, in Vedic lore.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.170 align:middle line:84%
All of this points
us to the heart

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:51.200 align:middle line:84%
and love as being the
primary force of all alchemy.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the hexagram
or star tetrahedron

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:55.420 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
primal symbols

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.440 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Absolutely.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so its
lattice structure is?

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Its lattice
structure is hexagonal.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to do something
called x-ray diffraction,

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.400 align:middle line:84%
bombard little powdered
pieces of it with x-ray,

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.920 align:middle line:84%
because it's a barrel, the
pattern it would actually make

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.410 align:middle line:84%
is the same pattern
as the Flower of Life.

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:18.040 align:middle line:84%
So its molecules are actually
arranged in that same pattern.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite
overtly hexagonal when

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:22.840 align:middle line:84%
you look at the way all the
circles line up they have

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.670 align:middle line:90%
sort of a hexagonal perimeter.

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:27.980 align:middle line:90%
What are some of its uses in--

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.400 align:middle line:84%
do you ever meditate
with emerald?

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Yes.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk
about that experience.

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Yeah, so when
we work with emerald,

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.251 align:middle line:84%
it's really activating
to the heart center.

00:42:35.251 --> 00:42:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Not just in a real cursory kind
of way; it opens the heart,

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:41.260 align:middle line:84%
but it allows us to get this
perspective that the heart is

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.670 align:middle line:90%
really all that matters.

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:44.680 align:middle line:84%
The heart is the
fundamental meeting place

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.480 align:middle line:90%
of heaven and earth.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.604 align:middle line:84%
So we have these earthy
stones in obsidian and jade

00:42:49.604 --> 00:42:50.770 align:middle line:90%
which is leading us upwards.

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:54.670 align:middle line:84%
We have this really heavenly
stone when it comes to lapis.

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:55.930 align:middle line:90%
And emerald unites them.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:58.660 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to take all of
these raw materials of heaven

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:00.620 align:middle line:90%
and earth and put them together.

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:04.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the beginning of the
Emerald Tablet, the text, on it

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:09.280 align:middle line:84%
says that this is absolutely
true, most certain, and "as

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.730 align:middle line:90%
above, so below."

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:11.530 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:12.946 align:middle line:84%
And that tells us
that the meeting

00:43:12.946 --> 00:43:15.220 align:middle line:84%
place of above and
below is the heart.

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.859 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we get
when we sit with emerald.

00:43:17.859 --> 00:43:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about the
healing properties of it

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and how you can work
with emerald in healing.

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: So emerald is
the carrier of the green ray

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.080 align:middle line:90%
in gemstone therapy.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Gem therapy is a little
bit of a different foray

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.640 align:middle line:84%
than your average form
of crystal healing

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.473 align:middle line:84%
because we use really
high-end tools, things

00:43:32.473 --> 00:43:33.274 align:middle line:90%
that are very pure.

00:43:33.274 --> 00:43:35.273 align:middle line:84%
Just like if you were
going to see an herbalist,

00:43:35.273 --> 00:43:37.330 align:middle line:84%
you want just the strongest
extract of something

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:38.620 align:middle line:90%
to be therapeutic.

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:40.450 align:middle line:90%
We do the same thing with gems.

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And so these sort of
steward or carrier

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:44.980 align:middle line:84%
of that primal green
energy in planet Earth

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:46.540 align:middle line:90%
happens to be the emerald.

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And the green ray is
all about recognizing

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:51.160 align:middle line:84%
that the physical form
is a manifestation

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.630 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual truth.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So in a roundabout
way, that translates

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.520 align:middle line:84%
to achieving our physical
perfection or physical healing.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.460 align:middle line:84%
So ancient cultures used
it for soothing the eyes,

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:03.550 align:middle line:84%
for vision, for closing
wounds, but it's

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:07.570 align:middle line:84%
got a really strong connection
to any sort of physical change.

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And the motivator, the force
behind it, the catalyst,

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.960 align:middle line:84%
is of course love,
unconditional love.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We tend to, when
looking at these stones,

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:18.520 align:middle line:84%
we tend to judge
them thinking, well,

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.680 align:middle line:84%
if it's really clear and
transparent and bright,

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.040 align:middle line:84%
bright green it's going to
have a better healing effect

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:28.500 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going to use it than
one that is more opaque.

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.869 align:middle line:90%
Is that necessarily true?

00:44:29.869 --> 00:44:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: I think
there's a different tool

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:33.524 align:middle line:90%
for every project.

00:44:33.524 --> 00:44:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So if we're just looking
at the physics of it,

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.480 align:middle line:84%
certainly an
unincluded material,

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.340 align:middle line:84%
something that's very
transparent and pure,

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.190 align:middle line:84%
has fewer other vibrations in
it because every other substance

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:44.830 align:middle line:84%
that's sort of crammed
into the crystal lattice

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:46.990 align:middle line:84%
is bringing its own
vibratory signature.

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's where
we see the kind of variegated

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.560 align:middle line:90%
looking--

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Exactly.

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So in gem therapy,
one of our goals

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.660 align:middle line:84%
is to get just that
distilled, pure emerald energy

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.470 align:middle line:84%
or pure quartz or any
other gemstone's energy.

00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No occlusions.

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Right, as
few as are reasonable.

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Something like emerald
rarely is ever flawless.

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:06.310 align:middle line:90%
It's virtually impossible.

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:09.276 align:middle line:84%
So there's a reasonable
amount of leeway there.

00:45:09.276 --> 00:45:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then you're
talking about fairly tiny pieces

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:12.400 align:middle line:90%
to work with then?

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Right.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let's talk
about the piece we have

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:15.240 align:middle line:90%
in front of us for example.

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: So over here,
we've got a pretty large piece

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:17.455 align:middle line:90%
of emerald.

00:45:17.455 --> 00:45:18.790 align:middle line:90%
This one's from India.

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:21.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's cut into a shape
that's called the emerald cut.

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:24.400 align:middle line:84%
It's got a really
flat surface that's

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.930 align:middle line:84%
meant to sort of
deepen the color,

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:27.590 align:middle line:84%
and they tend to
be tall and wide.

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:30.282 align:middle line:84%
So it sort of collects that
light that's within there.

00:45:30.282 --> 00:45:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what would
this be appropriate for working

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:33.490 align:middle line:90%
with, for example?

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:35.448 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: So this is
going to be a lot gentler

00:45:35.448 --> 00:45:38.800 align:middle line:84%
than maybe a gem quality
emerald, so sometimes really

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.520 align:middle line:84%
intense and perfect
gemstones can feel invasive,

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.020 align:middle line:84%
especially when you use them
for localized therapies, things

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:45.920 align:middle line:84%
where we're placing
them on specific points.

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:47.777 align:middle line:84%
Whereas a less gem
quality emerald like this

00:45:47.777 --> 00:45:50.110 align:middle line:84%
is something that is going
to be much gentler and slower

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:51.260 align:middle line:90%
in the uptake.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So you could use it for more
prolonged exposure or maybe

00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:55.339 align:middle line:90%
more meditative pursuits.

00:45:55.339 --> 00:45:57.130 align:middle line:84%
But certainly you could
use it for anything

00:45:57.130 --> 00:45:59.580 align:middle line:84%
you're using a really
nice emerald for too.

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which organs
does it relate to?

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:04.190 align:middle line:90%
What parts of the body?

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:05.830 align:middle line:90%
The heart?

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: The heart
on a spiritual level.

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:09.697 align:middle line:84%
But then any of
our physical body

00:46:09.697 --> 00:46:12.280 align:middle line:84%
period, because that green ray
is all about our physical form.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so all of them.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.090 align:middle line:90%
All right, next, amethyst.

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:18.890 align:middle line:84%
We always think people in
metaphysical communities

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:21.750 align:middle line:84%
think, OK, amethyst, just like
the one sitting behind you.

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Amethyst is the one that unites
us with the upper realms,

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:25.190 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: For sure.

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Yeah, so amethyst
is the stone of temperance,

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:34.180 align:middle line:84%
of alchemy, of recognizing
the divinity that's within us.

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Amethyst represents our
own divine connections.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of its
primary functions is

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:40.990 align:middle line:84%
to show us all
the behaviors that

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:43.266 align:middle line:84%
are standing in the way
of our divine connection.

00:46:43.266 --> 00:46:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of where that
temperance idea comes from.

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:47.265 align:middle line:84%
Even the name amethyst
comes from Greek

00:46:47.265 --> 00:46:49.947 align:middle line:90%
"amethustos," not intoxicated.

00:46:49.947 --> 00:46:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Greek wine was not the most
pleasant substance to drink.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.830 align:middle line:90%
They used red grapes.

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:57.820 align:middle line:84%
They would put it in amphoras
made out of porous material

00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:59.702 align:middle line:84%
so they'd put tar or
pitch on the inside.

00:46:59.702 --> 00:47:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So they would water it
down, cut it with honey.

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:04.750 align:middle line:84%
But let's say you gave your
guests really strong wine

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:05.590 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:08.320 align:middle line:84%
If you had cups
carved from amethyst

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.521 align:middle line:84%
then the wine could keep
getting watered down

00:47:10.521 --> 00:47:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and they would never know
because it would still

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:13.720 align:middle line:90%
appear to be dark purple.

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:15.250 align:middle line:84%
So you could drink and drink
and drink and never get

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:16.050 align:middle line:90%
any drunker.

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:18.105 align:middle line:84%
Hence, the stone of
not being intoxicated.

00:47:18.105 --> 00:47:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On a very
practical level.

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: But
spiritually-speaking,

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:23.914 align:middle line:84%
what it's doing is, the
carrier of the violet rays,

00:47:23.914 --> 00:47:27.290 align:middle line:84%
is that it helps to sort of find
our most limiting influences

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:28.090 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:31.570 align:middle line:84%
It's been used in clerical
settings, bishop's rings,

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and other sort of spiritual
uses to sort of act

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:38.920 align:middle line:84%
as that tempering
factor to step away

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.920 align:middle line:84%
from the limiting factors that
are kind of holding us back.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's
overindulging in alcohol

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:48.610 align:middle line:84%
or overindulging in beating
yourself up internally.

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:51.199 align:middle line:84%
So both of those things are
things we can be addicted to.

00:47:51.199 --> 00:47:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And amethyst is there to kind
of help break those addictions.

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:56.484 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so working
with on an emotional level.

00:47:56.484 --> 00:47:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: So definitely this
is a great stone and time we

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.279 align:middle line:90%
need to transmute our emotions.

00:48:01.279 --> 00:48:03.820 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of second archetype
in the book is that of alchemy.

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:05.750 align:middle line:84%
We look at the violet
flame for example,

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:09.430 align:middle line:84%
which is a tool that comes
from the ascended master

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:11.050 align:middle line:90%
teachings, the hand movement.

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And the violet flame
tells us that, whenever

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:17.140 align:middle line:84%
we invoke this high intense
spiritual flame of energy,

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:19.050 align:middle line:84%
it takes whatever
that base state is,

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:20.440 align:middle line:84%
something that
might be negative,

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.760 align:middle line:84%
something that might be
holding us back or hurting us,

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and it allows it to be totally
transformed into something

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:27.137 align:middle line:90%
helpful, positive and healing.

00:48:27.137 --> 00:48:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So we can use it for
emotional healing

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.810 align:middle line:84%
to find peace and serenity
even in times of great stress

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:33.390 align:middle line:84%
because it allows
us to capitalize

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:35.960 align:middle line:84%
upon that sort of
transmutational effect

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:37.834 align:middle line:90%
of the violet flame.

00:48:37.834 --> 00:48:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
about sleeping on in?

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.784 align:middle line:84%
Now we're back to the biomat
again because in the winter

00:48:42.784 --> 00:48:44.200 align:middle line:84%
when it's cool out
in particular I

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.890 align:middle line:84%
sleep on the biomat, the
amethyst one particular.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And I found it interesting
that the people I knew--

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.910 align:middle line:84%
a lot of us bought it
at the same time among

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:54.130 align:middle line:90%
my girlfriends--

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:56.590 align:middle line:90%
all had this same feeling.

00:48:56.590 --> 00:48:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Before we went to
bed at night, it

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:02.140 align:middle line:84%
was this inviting
feeling like almost

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:03.430 align:middle line:90%
like it's a relationship.

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, like it is a
relationship where you just

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:08.950 align:middle line:84%
couldn't wait to climb
in and get on your mat.

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And obviously it's the
amethyst speaking in that

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:15.250 align:middle line:84%
because you're relating to
something in there, right?

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:17.350 align:middle line:84%
So can you talk about
sleeping on amethyst

00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:18.710 align:middle line:90%
versus sleeping on jade?

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:19.540 align:middle line:90%


00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Amethyst
is a stone that

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.967 align:middle line:84%
has its own sort of
dreamlike quality to it

00:49:22.967 --> 00:49:24.550 align:middle line:84%
but a very different
mechanism for it.

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:26.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not anchored in
the present moment

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.660 align:middle line:84%
so much as it is opening
a divine channel to us.

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:33.550 align:middle line:84%
So when we really strengthen
that support system

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:35.417 align:middle line:84%
with the other
realm, when we let

00:49:35.417 --> 00:49:37.000 align:middle line:84%
go of the things
that are limiting us,

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.620 align:middle line:84%
allow ourselves
to be transformed,

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:41.950 align:middle line:84%
then we achieve this sort
of sacred space, this bubble

00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:45.550 align:middle line:84%
around us where we
become totally enveloped

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.860 align:middle line:90%
in our own innate divinity.

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:50.020 align:middle line:84%
So I would imagine that
sleeping on amethyst

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:53.530 align:middle line:84%
is like crawling into
this sort of sacred space,

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:55.902 align:middle line:84%
like walking into
a holy cathedral.

00:49:55.902 --> 00:49:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There is
that feeling about it,

00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:00.010 align:middle line:84%
and also then on a
physiological level

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:01.892 align:middle line:84%
it seems to really calm
the nervous system.

00:50:01.892 --> 00:50:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Right, absolutely.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:06.220 align:middle line:84%
The violet ray is the
most nourishing ray

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:07.440 align:middle line:90%
for the nervous system.

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:11.122 align:middle line:84%
So since amethyst is the carrier
of that ray it relates to it.

00:50:11.122 --> 00:50:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
might have been part

00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:15.340 align:middle line:84%
of their consideration
in the R&D

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.380 align:middle line:84%
to switch over to
amethyst in that way

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:19.310 align:middle line:84%
because everyone's
so jangled anymore.

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And it does calm
that right down.

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Any other thoughts on amethyst
that's used historically

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.690 align:middle line:90%
that would matter to us today?

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: I think
we've covered it.

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Then we can hop onto quartz,
because this is the one most

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:34.110 align:middle line:84%
people are most familiar
with and we've all

00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:36.840 align:middle line:84%
had our tales and stories
with, and oftentimes

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:38.847 align:middle line:84%
the very first stone
most people start with.

00:50:38.847 --> 00:50:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Absolutely,
so quartz technically

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.240 align:middle line:84%
gets two whole
chapters in the book

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.760 align:middle line:84%
because amethyst is
a variety of quartz.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.480 align:middle line:84%
That's just how important
quartz is to all of us.

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes
down to it, quartz

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.320 align:middle line:84%
is one of these
fundamental tools.

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:56.530 align:middle line:84%
It attracts all of the energies
in sort of equal temperament.

00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:59.610 align:middle line:84%
A perfect piece of quartz
is a perfect prism.

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:03.330 align:middle line:84%
It divides white light into
all the seven incident rays.

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:05.190 align:middle line:84%
So it provides us
with all the help

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:06.810 align:middle line:84%
we need in a broad
spectrum way, which

00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:09.480 align:middle line:90%
is why we're so attached to--

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:13.119 align:middle line:84%
rather it's why we're so
attracted to its energies.

00:51:13.119 --> 00:51:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And when we work with
quartz, we get a tool

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:19.380 align:middle line:84%
that can be soft and gentle when
it's tumbled or really directed

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and focused when it's
either polished to a point

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:23.460 align:middle line:90%
or in its natural state too.

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:25.050 align:middle line:90%
It's very versatile.

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
talk about using it

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:28.322 align:middle line:90%
in healing in particular.

00:51:28.322 --> 00:51:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: So when we
work with quartz-- quartz

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.910 align:middle line:84%
is attracting life force
to wherever we place it.

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Whether we want to call
that the seven rays

00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:37.620 align:middle line:84%
or call it chi or
prana, it's sort

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:39.390 align:middle line:84%
of working like a
lens through which

00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:42.540 align:middle line:84%
that sort of universal
light around us is directed,

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:44.676 align:middle line:90%
drawn into our body.

00:51:44.676 --> 00:51:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Not just our
physical body either

00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:49.710 align:middle line:84%
but the multi-dimensional
bodies that we have.

00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And also when it comes to its
crystalline forms, the shapes

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:55.050 align:middle line:84%
of it, whether they're
again polished wands

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:57.930 align:middle line:84%
or natural wands, it
becomes an energy tool.

00:51:57.930 --> 00:52:01.050 align:middle line:84%
People use them for
directing the flow of energy

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:03.427 align:middle line:84%
in and around the body through
the aura and the chakras.

00:52:03.427 --> 00:52:05.010 align:middle line:84%
You can use it for
things like cutting

00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:08.460 align:middle line:84%
cords for psychic surgery
and excising thought patterns

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:10.800 align:middle line:90%
from our nonphysical anatomy.

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's an amazing
tool for healing,

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.240 align:middle line:84%
and it comes in so
many different colors

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.990 align:middle line:84%
and shapes and
formations that it's

00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:20.910 align:middle line:84%
like having a whole
collection of tools

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:22.620 align:middle line:90%
encoded into a single mineral.

00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:25.170 align:middle line:84%
You can go out and find the
right quartz for the right job

00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:26.700 align:middle line:90%
virtually anywhere you go.

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:30.456 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And each one does
have its own abilities.

00:52:30.456 --> 00:52:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Yeah,
again, they have

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:34.930 align:middle line:84%
the same base
resonant frequency.

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:36.541 align:middle line:90%
But then they're specialized.

00:52:36.541 --> 00:52:38.040 align:middle line:84%
When we get something
like amethyst,

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.780 align:middle line:84%
for example, it's got
trace amounts of iron that

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.800 align:middle line:84%
make it purple, and
that iron and the color

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:44.890 align:middle line:84%
are giving a new personality
to the same old quartz.

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:47.550 align:middle line:84%
You might have something
else like smoky quartz, which

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:49.440 align:middle line:84%
is naturally irradiated
by the earth,

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:52.350 align:middle line:84%
and that causes these sort
of bends and empty spots

00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:55.320 align:middle line:84%
in the structure of it that
make it sort of suck up

00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.952 align:middle line:84%
like a vacuum all of the
photons that come through.

00:52:57.952 --> 00:52:59.910 align:middle line:84%
The more irradiated and
the more of those color

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:01.576 align:middle line:84%
centers there are the
darker it appears.

00:53:01.576 --> 00:53:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So smoky quartz is
grounding and protective,

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:07.230 align:middle line:84%
but it's really purifying
because it's literally

00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:11.609 align:middle line:84%
sucking, holding, pulling those
blockages that we might have.

00:53:11.609 --> 00:53:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
the ancient use of it,

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:15.090 align:middle line:84%
because many people
who've looked

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:17.490 align:middle line:84%
into ancient, ancient lore,
whether it's internally

00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:20.430 align:middle line:84%
or having read it in books
know of the great crystal

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:22.800 align:middle line:84%
in Atlantis and the way
technology was used,

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.781 align:middle line:84%
crystal technology
was used then.

00:53:24.781 --> 00:53:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Go ahead and explain some
of that because it's magical

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:28.260 align:middle line:90%
and we're headed there again.

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: Yeah for sure.

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
embedded in almost all

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.650 align:middle line:90%
our technology already.

00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:33.858 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: So the ancient
world was way more in touch

00:53:33.858 --> 00:53:36.540 align:middle line:90%
with the natural world.

00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Ancient people really
lived in a rhythm

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:42.480 align:middle line:84%
that we have forgotten, that
we've isolated ourselves from.

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.930 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes down to
it, in a place like Atlantis

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:48.180 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
live so in harmony

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:51.010 align:middle line:84%
with the mineral kingdom that
they could manifest miracles.

00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:54.150 align:middle line:84%
They used them for power
generators, to relay messages,

00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately it was greed
and all those other ego driven

00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:59.910 align:middle line:84%
things that caused them
to misuse crystals.

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:02.449 align:middle line:84%
That is believed to be
the fall of Atlantis.

00:54:02.449 --> 00:54:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
a whole other story.

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.010 align:middle line:84%
You could talk for
hours about that one.

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:09.390 align:middle line:84%
But we need to stick
to the subject at hand.

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:14.730 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at it in use for
communication with higher self

00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:16.170 align:middle line:84%
or with other
beings, because this

00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:19.470 align:middle line:84%
seems to have such strong
transmission and reception

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:20.550 align:middle line:90%
properties.

00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: So quartz is like
a natural sender and receiver.

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.183 align:middle line:84%
If we look at its
structure, that sort

00:54:24.183 --> 00:54:26.760 align:middle line:84%
of repeating lattice,
the way it spirals

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.782 align:middle line:84%
is a lot like the
fractal antennas that

00:54:28.782 --> 00:54:29.990 align:middle line:90%
are in our cell phones today.

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Phones today don't have
those long antennas

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:33.590 align:middle line:90%
you have to pull out.

00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:35.695 align:middle line:84%
It's because they're
very geometric, they

00:54:35.695 --> 00:54:38.070 align:middle line:84%
repeat in the same way that
the crystal lattice of quartz

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:39.120 align:middle line:90%
repeats.

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.661 align:middle line:84%
And they're also
natural oscillators,

00:54:40.661 --> 00:54:43.620 align:middle line:84%
so they can vibrate to specific
frequencies and rhythms

00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:45.780 align:middle line:84%
depending on the energy
or intention that we're

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:46.580 align:middle line:90%
working with.

00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So they're able to send and
receive these transmissions,

00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:49.990 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And they help to clarify
and refine our own ability

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.942 align:middle line:84%
to have these same sort of
spiritual communications.

00:54:55.942 --> 00:54:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell us how
you would begin then--

00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.780 align:middle line:84%
we only have a few minutes left
and I want to get to diamond

00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:01.900 align:middle line:90%
really quickly--

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.830 align:middle line:84%
but how you would begin
to create a relationship

00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:07.800 align:middle line:84%
say with any guides that
are within your realm

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.379 align:middle line:90%
with the use of quartz crystal?

00:55:09.379 --> 00:55:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: One of
the simplest things

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:14.256 align:middle line:84%
you can do is still your
mind, invite the crystal

00:55:14.256 --> 00:55:15.630 align:middle line:84%
to participate
with you, and what

00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:18.362 align:middle line:84%
I like to do is visualize
myself entering the crystal as

00:55:18.362 --> 00:55:20.820 align:middle line:84%
if you're seeing the stone get
larger and larger and larger

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:22.680 align:middle line:84%
and so you could
just walk inside.

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And if we go in
with the intention

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.894 align:middle line:84%
of inviting those spiritual
guides to be there,

00:55:26.894 --> 00:55:28.560 align:middle line:84%
more often than not
at least one of them

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:30.143 align:middle line:84%
will be present and
be willing to have

00:55:30.143 --> 00:55:31.484 align:middle line:90%
a conversation with you.

00:55:31.484 --> 00:55:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:35.280 align:middle line:84%
So just go inside
and wait and request

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:37.087 align:middle line:90%
and inset your intention.

00:55:37.087 --> 00:55:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And then other things
start happening.

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Then you start developing forms
of rapport and so forth, right?

00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And then also
keeping your crystal

00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:49.740 align:middle line:84%
charged, because they
can get dull absorbing

00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:52.110 align:middle line:84%
all the energies around
and even your own energies.

00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So how do you suggest
keeping them charged?

00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: I think more
important than charging

00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.523 align:middle line:90%
is actually clearing them.

00:55:56.523 --> 00:55:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That too, yes.

00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And I know there are a
lot of different thoughts

00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:01.590 align:middle line:84%
on that that
contradict each other.

00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: So the
basic idea here

00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:06.040 align:middle line:84%
is that, again, if we're
looking at the science of it,

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:07.810 align:middle line:84%
a crystal needs to be
a balanced equation.

00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:10.500 align:middle line:84%
You can't fit more energy in
without energy coming out.

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.685 align:middle line:84%
So if you ever feel
like it's kind of stuck,

00:56:12.685 --> 00:56:15.060 align:middle line:84%
then the best thing you can
do is cleanse it or clear it.

00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:17.790 align:middle line:84%
You can check out
exercise in the book that

00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:19.710 align:middle line:84%
actually use the
breath to cleanse them

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:20.840 align:middle line:90%
like Marcel Vogel did.

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:23.970 align:middle line:84%
But people use sacred sound
and sunlight and water and salt

00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:25.716 align:middle line:90%
and lots of other ways.

00:56:25.716 --> 00:56:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And sometimes even
just burying it in the earth

00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:31.170 align:middle line:84%
to extract that and
just become quiet again.

00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And then bring it back up and
then maybe place it in the sun.

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Get a little charge after
the clearing and all that.

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:40.565 align:middle line:84%
What do you find between
the sun and the crystal?

00:56:40.565 --> 00:56:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: This is one of
those sort of gray areas,

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:44.220 align:middle line:84%
because again, the
science of it says

00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:46.595 align:middle line:84%
that it's receiving the same
radiant energy whether we're

00:56:46.595 --> 00:56:48.549 align:middle line:84%
inside on a cloudy day
or outside in full sun.

00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
from inside the Earth,

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:52.764 align:middle line:84%
but they seem to react very
powerfully with the sun.

00:56:52.764 --> 00:56:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: So
quartz in particular

00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:57.810 align:middle line:84%
has a very strong relationship
with optical imagery.

00:56:57.810 --> 00:56:59.490 align:middle line:84%
We see it as a
sort of primordial

00:56:59.490 --> 00:57:01.800 align:middle line:84%
want which is really just
a prism in its raw state.

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And then we also have
the lens, the spheres,

00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:05.740 align:middle line:84%
the crystal globes
that have been used.

00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:09.850 align:middle line:84%
So it really comes to life when
we allow it to work with light.

00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:11.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not always visible light.

00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's just that sort
of capital L spiritual light,

00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:19.350 align:middle line:84%
but it helps to focus, condense,
refract, and direct light

00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:21.000 align:middle line:90%
on many levels.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Quickly, we only
have a couple minutes left,

00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:24.960 align:middle line:90%
diamonds.

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:28.500 align:middle line:10%
>>PEARSON: Diamonds are
an interesting stone.

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's called
the unconquerable

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:31.910 align:middle line:90%
and the thunderbolt, right?

00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: The word diamond
itself comes from Greek again,

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:37.221 align:middle line:84%
adamas, not tamed
or not conquered.

00:57:37.221 --> 00:57:38.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's literally an
invincible substance.

00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:40.624 align:middle line:84%
Diamond is so
strong that it could

00:57:40.624 --> 00:57:42.540 align:middle line:84%
cut through any other
stone but no other stone

00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:43.669 align:middle line:90%
could cut through it.

00:57:43.669 --> 00:57:45.210 align:middle line:84%
So the ancient people
believe that it

00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:48.370 align:middle line:84%
conferred the same level
of invincibility to us.

00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:50.880 align:middle line:84%
That invincibility
is derived from when

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:52.860 align:middle line:84%
we recognize the
one unconquerable

00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:55.277 align:middle line:84%
force in the universe
is unconditional love.

00:57:55.277 --> 00:57:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
why it became the stone

00:57:57.110 --> 00:57:58.899 align:middle line:90%
in wedding rings historically?

00:57:58.899 --> 00:58:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Yeah, for
sure, because if we're

00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:02.220 align:middle line:84%
willing to surrender
to that then

00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:03.845 align:middle line:84%
everything else is
a walk in the park.

00:58:03.845 --> 00:58:06.094 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There you go, and
that's the hardest of all.

00:58:06.094 --> 00:58:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts on your
general passion and love

00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:10.740 align:middle line:84%
for crystal and by
way of encouragement

00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.645 align:middle line:84%
for people not to be
intimidated by them?

00:58:12.645 --> 00:58:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: Yeah, find the
stones that speak to you.

00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:17.100 align:middle line:10%
The answer is that your
relationship with the stone

00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:19.260 align:middle line:10%
is far more important
than any other person,

00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:21.450 align:middle line:10%
any other expert's idea
of what stones do for you.

00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:24.300 align:middle line:10%
So find the ones you
gravitate towards.

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:27.180 align:middle line:10%
Work with them even if you
don't have a specific protocol.

00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Just sit with them, invite
them to be present with you,

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:31.627 align:middle line:84%
and you'd be surprised
at what happens.

00:58:31.627 --> 00:58:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent.

00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much
for your life's work which

00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:35.613 align:middle line:90%
is still a very short one.

00:58:35.613 --> 00:58:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And I have to ask you,
did you put that shirt on

00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:39.480 align:middle line:90%
to match your eyes today?

00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARSON: I did, yes.

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It couldn't
be coincidence.

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much Nicholas.

00:58:44.370 --> 00:58:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARSON: My pleasure,
thank you Regina.

00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I hope this has
been as instructive for you

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:48.750 align:middle line:90%
as it has for me.

00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:51.660 align:middle line:84%
A wonderful primer on the depth
of these beautiful stones.

00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:54.180 align:middle line:10%
Once again, the name of the
book is, "The Seven Archetypal

00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:56.070 align:middle line:10%
Stones," by Nicholas Pearson.

00:58:56.070 --> 00:59:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
