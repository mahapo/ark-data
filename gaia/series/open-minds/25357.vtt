>>REGINA MEREDITH: Legends
and religious texts

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.340 align:middle line:84%
have dated the human
species anywhere from 6,000

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:84%
to billions of years old,
depending on one's belief.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.650 align:middle line:84%
But once we move beyond belief,
we need to look for evidence.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Michael Tellinger has been
examining some strange sites

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.590 align:middle line:84%
in southern Africa that point
to the most ancient artifacts

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.870 align:middle line:90%
of human existence.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.190 align:middle line:84%
In his story, our
species dates back

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.970 align:middle line:84%
to between 250,000
and 500,000 years.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we lay the
framework for how

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.950 align:middle line:84%
this came into your life and how
you started finding these along

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.557 align:middle line:84%
with Johann, how you started
finding these incredible sites?

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL TELLINGER:
Well, thanks very much,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Regina, and thanks for talking
to me on your amazing show.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And the journey, for me,
started at a very young age,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.650 align:middle line:84%
like, I think many people
in this area of research

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.957 align:middle line:84%
and belief systems start
out at a young age,

00:01:14.957 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:84%
where I wasn't really quite
happy with the answers I was

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.690 align:middle line:84%
getting from teachers
and history books

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.920 align:middle line:84%
and the normal kind of
material that one gets to read.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.523 align:middle line:84%
And you go in search of
alternative reading materials,

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:27.940 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly you
realize, hold on,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:84%
this resonates a
lot more with me

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.350 align:middle line:84%
than anything else I'm
being taught at school.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not only
was your mind now

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.970 align:middle line:84%
turned to look at humanity
in a whole different way,

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.860 align:middle line:84%
but then comes the
artifact, the evidence.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yes.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.618 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this-- this
is really astounding.

00:01:43.618 --> 00:01:46.630 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah, and so
at some stage, I sat down

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:10%
and I realized I had this huge
accumulated body of knowledge

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:10%
and information that I could
pull together, because I

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:10%
had an ability to write.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.640 align:middle line:10%
And I sat down, and I wrote
"Slave Species of God."

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.790 align:middle line:10%
Shortly after that, I started
traveling through South Africa

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.490 align:middle line:10%
and doing presentations
on "Slave Species," pretty

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.890 align:middle line:10%
much taking a lot
of the information

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:10%
that I've been studying,
but not finding itself

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:13.930 align:middle line:10%
on one platform of a cohesive
storyline of human origins

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:10%
and our journey to
who we are today.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And we might as
well just be dealing

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.060 align:middle line:84%
with a god with a small "g" as
opposed to God with a big "G."

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: When it comes
to belief systems,

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.360 align:middle line:10%
that is a very
important distinction.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.650 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: It's a huge,
huge, important distinction,

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.350 align:middle line:10%
because we're not
here bringing down

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.390 align:middle line:10%
any belief systems,
any religion,

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:10%
any spiritual movement.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:84%
We're actually trying
to bring everything back

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:84%
into unity, because that's
what it's all about, isn't it?

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Ultimately.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.160 align:middle line:84%
So shortly after I started
doing these presentations,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I bumped into Johann
Heine, who came

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.900 align:middle line:90%
to one of my presentations.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And he whipped out
a laptop and started

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:84%
showing me these
circular stone structures

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:84%
that he'd been photographing
for about 15 years at that stage

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.630 align:middle line:84%
already, and trying to
bring it to the attention

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.470 align:middle line:84%
of the authorities and the
universities in South Africa

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.990 align:middle line:90%
with absolutely no success.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And I took one look at
that, and in a flash,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I realized, and I knew
instantly that somehow that

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:84%
was related to what I'd
written about in "Slave

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Species of God."

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.440 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know to what extent.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.400 align:middle line:84%
At that stage, Johann was
working with a historian called

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Cyril Hromnik in South Africa,
who is a really amazing mind

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.270 align:middle line:84%
who wrote a book
called "Indo-Africa"

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.360 align:middle line:84%
and brought to the table
the importance of the Hindu

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Dravidians and their influence
for the last 4,000 years,

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.250 align:middle line:84%
probably around 4,000 years
already at this stage.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that the
stone circles were directly

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.940 align:middle line:84%
linked to what Zachariah
Sitchin had been writing about

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and this vast vanished
civilization in what he refers

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.390 align:middle line:84%
to as the Abzu, the gold mining
empire set up by the Annunaki

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:90%
in the Abzu.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.720 align:middle line:84%
So now if we can find evidence
of this gold-mining empire,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.380 align:middle line:84%
then what we can do is
reverse engineer it and find

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:90%
the gold-mining empire.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll find evidence
for Zachariah Sitchin has

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.860 align:middle line:84%
been writing about,
and here we are, bingo,

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.083 align:middle line:84%
presenting that evidence in
absolutely irrefutable forms.

00:04:19.083 --> 00:04:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you know if
he was exposed to your work

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.082 align:middle line:90%
before his death?

00:04:22.082 --> 00:04:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: In my
presentations at the moment,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:84%
I express my great
sadness to the extent

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.640 align:middle line:84%
that Zachariah never
got to see any of this,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.520 align:middle line:84%
because the things he knew that
would have enabled us to speed

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.570 align:middle line:84%
up this process that I'm going
through, pulling together

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:84%
various parts of
his translations

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.260 align:middle line:84%
and finding the
physical evidence

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.200 align:middle line:84%
for what he wrote about,
without him knowing

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.720 align:middle line:90%
that we were going to find it.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: That, for me,
is the most exciting thing.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Help us through
the history of how many sites

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.700 align:middle line:90%
had been discovered.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: OK.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Before I go there,
just very quickly,

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:84%
all of this stuff that
we're talking about

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.850 align:middle line:90%
is inextricably linked to gold.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.750 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible to separate
human history and human origins

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.060 align:middle line:90%
from our obsession with gold.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.770 align:middle line:84%
The number of these
ruins in southern Africa,

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.980 align:middle line:90%
this is not a new fascination.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.620 align:middle line:84%
This was first picked up
by the Portuguese settlers

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.810 align:middle line:84%
in the late 1400s,
when they first

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.900 align:middle line:84%
came onto the land
from southern Africa

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.990 align:middle line:84%
as they were going past
the Cape of Good Hope

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.430 align:middle line:90%
or the Cape of storms.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And when they came
on land, they met

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.470 align:middle line:84%
the MaKomati people, which
Hromnik writes about,

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.820 align:middle line:90%
the Hindu Dravidians.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And they were told that this was
Terra dos MaKomatis, the land

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.170 align:middle line:90%
of the MaKomati people.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Then they went
further inland and met

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.700 align:middle line:84%
with some of the
native African tribes,

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.870 align:middle line:84%
who were living around
many of these stone ruins,

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily inhabiting
them, living around them

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:84%
in their typical
African rural villages.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.150 align:middle line:10%
And when they asked--

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:10%
this is in the late 1400s.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:10%
When they asked the
local African tribes

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.930 align:middle line:10%
who built these structures,
the answer was "we don't know."

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.240 align:middle line:10%
Now, that is not what you'll
read in history books today.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.697 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:06.530 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: I have a
big problem with that.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.950 align:middle line:10%
How come suddenly when
the people in 1400s

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.542 align:middle line:10%
didn't know who built it,
but today our historians,

00:06:11.542 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:10%
they claim that they know
exactly who built it, when,

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.270 align:middle line:10%
and how and why.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, advances
in academia, right?

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.095 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: Exactly.

00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:21.040 align:middle line:10%
The further back you go to
the source of the information,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.705 align:middle line:10%
the more accurate
it probably is,

00:06:22.705 --> 00:06:25.450 align:middle line:10%
so I'd like to stick with the
Portuguese version of this.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: And then
in the mid-1800s,

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.110 align:middle line:84%
a huge fascination started with
the stone ruins and this town

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.970 align:middle line:90%
circles in southern Africa.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And various researchers
came out from Germany

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and some other
parts of the world,

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.220 align:middle line:84%
and they looked at
these stone structures

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:90%
with great amazement.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.607 align:middle line:84%
And they had no idea
what they were all about.

00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine
what they thought.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:84%
They must have done exactly the
same as everybody else does.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.490 align:middle line:84%
As a historian or
an archaeologist,

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.070 align:middle line:84%
you immediately assume
that it must be dwellings,

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.700 align:middle line:84%
or it must be built by
people for your cattle,

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.810 align:middle line:90%
sheltering your cattle.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what you
still find in our history books

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.020 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.478 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Assumning
it's primitive.

00:07:06.478 --> 00:07:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Assuming
it's primitive, exactly.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.760 align:middle line:10%
And then the numbers
started coming out.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.590 align:middle line:10%
And the first estimate that I
read about or that I have found

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:10%
comes from who I
believe is probably

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.220 align:middle line:10%
the most brilliant archaeologist
in the last 120 years,

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:10%
Theodore Bent, a
British archaeologist

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.900 align:middle line:10%
who spent more than two
years in southern Africa,

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.060 align:middle line:10%
South Africa,
Botswana, Zimbabwe,

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.580 align:middle line:10%
exploring these ruins.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.103 align:middle line:10%
Theodore Bent estimated
from horseback,

00:07:32.103 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:10%
traveling through
southern Africa,

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.580 align:middle line:10%
that there were about
4,000 of these ruins.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.680 align:middle line:10%
That's already a
spectacular number

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.690 align:middle line:10%
if you think about
that, the fact

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.120 align:middle line:10%
that southern Africa is
supposed to have been a sparsely

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.860 align:middle line:10%
populated part of the world.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:84%
By 1974, the numbers
went up to about 20,000

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.600 align:middle line:84%
in various other estimates
by other researchers.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.420 align:middle line:10%
20,000 stone ruins in a
sparsely populated continent

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.532 align:middle line:10%
with only a few thousand
people running around,

00:07:57.532 --> 00:07:58.990 align:middle line:10%
you start seeing
that the numbers--

00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.220 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Busy workers, huh?

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.137 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah, the
numbers start to clash,

00:08:01.137 --> 00:08:03.520 align:middle line:10%
and they really start to
defy any kind of human logic.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.520 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: So already,
though, the warning bells

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.150 align:middle line:10%
should start going on.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.570 align:middle line:10%
But by the time I got involved
and I got exposed to it

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:14.500 align:middle line:10%
by Johann Heine, Johann
photographed hundreds if not

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.020 align:middle line:10%
thousands of these.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's just covering
a fraction of it.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle line:84%
By the time I spent
the first year

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.650 align:middle line:84%
walking around the mountains
looking at these ruins,

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:84%
I estimated there must be
at least 100,000 of these.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:31.330 align:middle line:84%
So we've gone from 4,000
to 100,000 in 100 years.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And that just wasn't
good enough for me.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't just
thumb suck a number.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.403 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking at
Google and aerial photographs.

00:08:39.403 --> 00:08:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because the
technology is there now.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: It's there.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And once you recognize the
symbols and the symptoms

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and the lay of the land,
you can extrapolate it.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:84%
You can get averages,
which is what I did.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at three main
cluster areas of these ruins,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.850 align:middle line:84%
two in South Africa
and one in Zimbabwe.

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I added
the numbers up, I

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.010 align:middle line:84%
could not believe my
eyes, because it was way

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.570 align:middle line:90%
beyond 100,000.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.490 align:middle line:90%
Not what I'd expected.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:90%
It was beyond 10 million.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beyond 10 million.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.143 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: 10 million
of these stone structures.

00:09:09.143 --> 00:09:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From
4,000 to 10 million.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: From
4,000 to 10 million.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, it's
hard to even fathom

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:16.280 align:middle line:84%
the land would be large enough
to accommodate 10 million

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.080 align:middle line:90%
of these.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as you can
see, these are very ornate,

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:90%
beautiful structures.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.810 align:middle line:84%
They're not any
kind of structure

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen anywhere
else in the world.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.885 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: You know,
that's an interesting thing.

00:09:26.885 --> 00:09:29.660 align:middle line:84%
There are stone circles
all over the world.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:84%
I've seen them in the Americas,
South America, North America,

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and Ireland, Scotland, all over
Europe, and now very important

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.500 align:middle line:90%
discoveries in Jordan.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.533 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands of stone
circular structures in Jordan.

00:09:41.533 --> 00:09:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But these
are different.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: These
are different.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.970 align:middle line:84%
What took me about a year
or more to figure out

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.098 align:middle line:84%
is the most obvious
question that everyone

00:09:51.098 --> 00:09:53.140 align:middle line:84%
should ask when you start
researching these stone

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.490 align:middle line:90%
structures.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And that question is, why is
each and every one completely

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.300 align:middle line:90%
unique?

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.558 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Every one of these,
more than 10 million stone

00:10:02.558 --> 00:10:04.700 align:middle line:84%
circular structures,
is completely unique.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.220 align:middle line:90%
No two are the same.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's just--

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And they're connected.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Not only are they
unique, they're all connected.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes well, sorry.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.630 align:middle line:90%
But yes. yes, exactly.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah, they're
connected by these channels

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.385 align:middle line:90%
that connect them together.

00:10:15.385 --> 00:10:18.130 align:middle line:90%
They don't stand alone.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.630 align:middle line:90%
So you've got the stone circles.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:84%
You've got the channels
that connect them.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.750 align:middle line:84%
When I say channels,
they look like roads

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.830 align:middle line:90%
from aerial photographs.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:24.850 align:middle line:90%
They look like roads.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what our
current historians tell us

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.417 align:middle line:84%
in our history books, through
their infinite wisdom.

00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:31.060 align:middle line:84%
They say that they
are roads, that they

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.290 align:middle line:84%
were built by the tribal people
to drive their cattle on.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And I find deep sadness in
that, because it shows you

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.660 align:middle line:84%
that they have done no
homework, no research.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:41.935 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, there's logic.

00:10:41.935 --> 00:10:43.630 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
the sophistication,

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.730 align:middle line:84%
you have to wonder
why people would

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.620 align:middle line:84%
in academia would
so easily settle

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.993 align:middle line:84%
for such a story that has no
inherent logic to it, honestly.

00:10:50.993 --> 00:10:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: No logic.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, at the
same time while they suggest

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.480 align:middle line:84%
that they were roads to
drive their cattle on,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.600 align:middle line:84%
they go and show us an
archaeological drawings as

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.170 align:middle line:84%
far back as 1939 that
these circles are

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.120 align:middle line:90%
connected by these channels.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, they
have no doors and entrances.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:14.080 align:middle line:84%
They're just fully enclosed
circular structures

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.560 align:middle line:84%
with sometimes very simple
structures and sometimes very

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.510 align:middle line:90%
complex structures.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And when I realized
that, when I accidentally

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.340 align:middle line:84%
heard some of the stones
in the stone walls.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.840 align:middle line:90%
[RINGING]

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.247 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on
how you hold it.

00:11:35.247 --> 00:11:37.830 align:middle line:84%
When we were clearing it so that
we can take tourists in there

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
and show them some
of these structures,

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:84%
and I heard the
stones being moved

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.810 align:middle line:84%
and I heard them clanging
against each other,

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and I heard that
they rang like bells,

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.160 align:middle line:84%
and each one rang at
a different frequency,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and these guys, as were
they moving the stones,

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.630 align:middle line:84%
I heard this cacophony of
bell-like sounds going on

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:84%
in the distance,
and I went, hold on,

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.100 align:middle line:90%
this is all about sound.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.410 align:middle line:84%
This has got nothing
to do with cattle.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:84%
It's got nothing to
do with dwellings.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.440 align:middle line:84%
This has got everything
to do with sound and sound

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:90%
frequencies.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
defining moment that

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.050 align:middle line:84%
really led me to reach the
conclusions that I did.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.592 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let's talk about
the measurements that happened

00:12:16.592 --> 00:12:17.590 align:middle line:90%
within these areas, OK?

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: What
happened first is,

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.720 align:middle line:84%
when I started taking people
on tours to the stone ruins

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.200 align:middle line:84%
and Adam's Calendar, we
noticed that your GPS

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.125 align:middle line:84%
stops to WORK especially
at Adam's Calendar.

00:12:29.125 --> 00:12:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's
a nice trick we use.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, I take
people in there,

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I say, OK, if you
go in there, you'll

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.660 align:middle line:84%
see your GPS is
will stop working.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And the macho guys always say
to you, "oh, my GPS will work.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.920 align:middle line:90%
Watch."

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And they go in there,
and very quickly,

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.650 align:middle line:90%
"what's going on here?"

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And so clearly there's
some energy fields

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.730 align:middle line:84%
that are causing
havoc with the GPS,

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.240 align:middle line:84%
and they don't allow the
satellite signal to reach you.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Once you walk into
this magical circle,

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.050 align:middle line:84%
there is no WALL It's
an imaginary circle,

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.930 align:middle line:84%
once you go in there,
you're out of sight.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.850 align:middle line:84%
So I realized that
there was some sort

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.290 align:middle line:84%
of an electromagnetic
field that was there.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And from the very
first time I started

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.170 align:middle line:84%
taking people, especially the
psychics and the people that

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:12.950 align:middle line:84%
feel energy and dowsers, They
started telling me immediately,

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:84%
this is a vortex,
it's an active portal,

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.510 align:middle line:84%
it's a transmutation
device, it's a stargate.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.940 align:middle line:84%
All these kind of expressions
were thrown at me.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, "OK, I'm an
open-minded guy, I'll take it.

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:29.720 align:middle line:84%
I'll hold onto that information
until I can make sense of it."

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And then, as time went
by, I met this guy

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.640 align:middle line:84%
who's got this
amazing device that

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.820 align:middle line:84%
can measure electromagnetic
fields, that can measure

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.360 align:middle line:84%
heat signatures, which is
an average down to about

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.390 align:middle line:84%
300 meters below the surface,
which tells you there's

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.750 align:middle line:84%
some weird stuff going on with
the temperatures that shouldn't

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:51.730 align:middle line:84%
be happening, sound
frequencies, and the loudness

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.933 align:middle line:84%
of the sound
frequencies in decibels.

00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:55.600 align:middle line:10%
And we went in, and
we started measuring

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.280 align:middle line:10%
some of these stone circles.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.860 align:middle line:10%
And it just blew our mind.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.375 align:middle line:10%
It completely blew my mind.

00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:03.250 align:middle line:10%
What happened is, this
chap went and he first

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.370 align:middle line:10%
measured it on his own,
and I got wind of it.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And I heard the
information that he

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.620 align:middle line:84%
shared with a journalist
in a small town

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.230 align:middle line:84%
right next to where I live,
and I couldn't believe my ears.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.203 align:middle line:90%
So I hunted him down.

00:14:16.203 --> 00:14:17.620 align:middle line:84%
I said, you better
come back here.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.990 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back in there
with you, with your devices.

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:21.670 align:middle line:84%
I want to see it
for myself, and I

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.230 align:middle line:84%
want you to tell me
and explain to me

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.380 align:middle line:84%
what you think you measured
and what you think you found.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And he told me, "well, I
measured sound frequencies

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.750 align:middle line:84%
beyond 14 gigahertz,
which is insane.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And I measured
electromagnetic waves

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.137 align:middle line:84%
that are just inside the stone
walls, of the stone circles.

00:14:39.137 --> 00:14:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And I can also tell you where
the next stone circle is,"

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:42.310 align:middle line:90%
he told me.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And I went, "how
could you tell that?"

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.727 align:middle line:84%
He says, "because there
are these energy lines

00:14:45.727 --> 00:14:47.620 align:middle line:90%
that run from circle to circle."

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.280 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know what I knew.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The cattle crawl.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.117 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: He didn't
know what I knew.

00:14:52.117 --> 00:14:54.590 align:middle line:84%
So as he was telling me all
this stuff, I was going,

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.880 align:middle line:84%
"my goodness, he's
measured the things

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:84%
that I've been
observing visually."

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: So then
we went out together,

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and we remeasured it, and got
the same results a second time,

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.390 align:middle line:84%
corroborated everything
he did, and we went

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and measured more sites
that he didn't know About

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.770 align:middle line:90%
and that blew my mind even more.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:10%
Basically, in a nutshell, we're
measuring electromagnetic waves

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.820 align:middle line:10%
that run horizontally
inside the stone circles,

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:23.320 align:middle line:10%
creating a dome-shaped kind
of roof structure effect that

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.250 align:middle line:10%
prevents signals coming in.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.640 align:middle line:90%
That's why you lose GPS.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And then some stone circles,
the electromagnetic fields

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.710 align:middle line:84%
run out of the ground
straight into the sky.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.270 align:middle line:90%
They run vertically.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.940 align:middle line:84%
So you get horizontal movement
and vertical movement.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.030 align:middle line:84%
We measure heat signatures,
that the average temperature's

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.470 align:middle line:90%
300 meters below the ground.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.270 align:middle line:90%
It's either 200 or 300 meters.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.770 align:middle line:10%
And the maximum heat
signature you can measure

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.310 align:middle line:10%
is 80 degrees Celsius,
at which point

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:52.060 align:middle line:10%
it suggests you're standing
on top of a volcano.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.760 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: What was the average
land outside of these stone

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.720 align:middle line:10%

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Give us an example of
what the temperature was?

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah, so we
measured the sound frequencies

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:00.370 align:middle line:90%
outside--

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:01.170 align:middle line:90%
nothing.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.040 align:middle line:90%
Just ambient noise.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.663 align:middle line:84%
You turn it inwards and it goes
crazy, beyond 14 gigahertz.

00:16:06.663 --> 00:16:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Beyond the ability
of our dogs to hear it.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Beyond anything.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.080 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: In
fact, some people

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.870 align:middle line:10%
will argue with you that it's no
longer sound you're measuring.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And yet that's what
we're measuring.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.177 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:16:17.177 --> 00:16:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: And it tells us
that the sound frequency is

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:20.310 align:middle line:90%
in--

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.290 align:middle line:84%
you know, the lowest we
measured is about 11 gigahertz

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.720 align:middle line:90%
at about 72 decibels.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.730 align:middle line:90%
That's how loud it is.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.170 align:middle line:90%
And then it goes up to--

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.030 align:middle line:84%
the sound frequencies go
up to, at Adam's Calendar,

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:37.640 align:middle line:84%
beyond 375 gigahertz, which is
beyond the frequency allocation

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Incredible energy

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: That wasn't

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.337 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:47.780 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: But the heat
signature is fascinating,

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.800 align:middle line:10%
because you're standing next
to this tiny little circle,

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.940 align:middle line:10%
and you point the device
outside the circle,

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.623 align:middle line:10%
and you're measuring
5 and half degrees.

00:16:56.623 --> 00:16:58.040 align:middle line:10%
That's the average
heat signature.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.998 align:middle line:10%
5 and 1/2 degrees on the
surface of the ground.

00:16:59.998 --> 00:17:02.165 align:middle line:10%
That's the average 200, 300
meters below the ground.

00:17:02.165 --> 00:17:02.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Celsius.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.040 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: As you turn
it into this little circle,

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.000 align:middle line:10%
it shoots up to like 29 degrees.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.790 align:middle line:10%
That's the lowest we
measured, 29 degrees.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Then it goes up to 33 degrees.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:13.109 align:middle line:84%
From 5 and 1/2 degrees to
33 degrees inside the bigger

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:14.839 align:middle line:90%
circles.

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:17.089 align:middle line:84%
The one big one on top of
the mountain that we always

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:21.680 align:middle line:84%
take people to, because it's 150
meters across, it's a big ruin.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.045 align:middle line:84%
You can see Dravidian
influence there, by the way.

00:17:24.045 --> 00:17:25.670 align:middle line:84%
In some of these
ruins, you can clearly

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.585 align:middle line:84%
see the recent occupation
of these ruins,

00:17:28.585 --> 00:17:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and that's where our
historians often get confused,

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:31.970 align:middle line:90%
because they see doorways and--

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.675 align:middle line:84%

>>TELLINGER: Not the builders.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.170 align:middle line:84%

Some basic--

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Remember

00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:45.040 align:middle line:90%
as a matter of fact.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah, exactly.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And at this one big ruin on
top, 5 and 1/2 degrees outside,

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.380 align:middle line:84%
you swing that device
inwards, and 58 degrees.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.440 align:middle line:90%
It's insane.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.610 align:middle line:90%
58 degrees.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:57.410 align:middle line:90%
But that's nothing.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.880 align:middle line:84%
When you get to Adam's
Calendar, that's

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.380 align:middle line:84%
where everything
we think we know

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.620 align:middle line:84%
about science and measurements
flies out the window.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.260 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly, all
those four years

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.650 align:middle line:10%
of taking people there and
learning from the psychics

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:13.580 align:middle line:10%
and listening to the energy
people that work with energies

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.700 align:middle line:10%
telling me that this is an
active vortex, it's a portal,

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:10%
it's a transmutation
device, it's

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.762 align:middle line:10%
a stargate, suddenly all of
that starts to make sense.

00:18:21.762 --> 00:18:23.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It could be
any and all of the above.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.630 align:middle line:10%
We don't understand those
ranges of frequencies.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.960 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: No, first of all,
the electromagnetic field,

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.570 align:middle line:10%
as you cross into Adam's
calendar, runs horizontally.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's four times as high
as the highest of the stone

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.380 align:middle line:90%
circles that we've measured.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And then you go between the
two central calender stones,

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's as if they
are activation plates.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And they create even a
higher electromagnetic field,

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.290 align:middle line:84%
but it runs out of the
ground into the sky.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:56.060 align:middle line:10%
So you got this
convoluted energetic field

00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:01.310 align:middle line:10%
with columns of energy
coming in and going out,

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:10%
and it's spectacular.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And it is at that
moment that I realized--

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.440 align:middle line:84%
and this is relatively
new information.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.520 align:middle line:84%
It's at that moment
that I realized

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:15.650 align:middle line:84%
that it is at Adam's Calendar
that they were probably

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:84%
transporting the
gold off this planet.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.590 align:middle line:90%

00:19:38.833 --> 00:19:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
but wait a minute.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:84%
It's also been
said that we do not

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:46.580 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to create
what is not already known

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.810 align:middle line:90%
on some level.

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.060 align:middle line:90%
We can leap frog.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.430 align:middle line:90%
We can recreate this technology.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:56.780 align:middle line:84%
What I'm telling you here is
that every one of those stone

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.000 align:middle line:90%
circles is an energy device.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.870 align:middle line:84%
It gives us huge amounts of
free energy every millisecond

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:03.980 align:middle line:90%
of the day.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.730 align:middle line:84%
We should have free energy just
by tapping into these millions

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.020 align:middle line:90%
of stone circles.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
some of them that

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:15.740 align:middle line:84%
are in the shape of magnetrons,
as what electrical engineers

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.732 align:middle line:84%
will know as magnetrons,
those create so much energy

00:20:18.732 --> 00:20:20.690 align:middle line:84%
that we probably won't
know what to do with it.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we get to the use
of the cone-shaped tools.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.880 align:middle line:84%
The stone, which rings
like a bell, which

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.440 align:middle line:90%
is known as hornfels stone.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.050 align:middle line:84%
The geology for that
is known as hornfels.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.170 align:middle line:90%
It's metamorphosis quartzite.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's got very strong
acoustic properties.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.790 align:middle line:90%
That's why they ring like bells.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.950 align:middle line:84%
But some geologists suggest
that they were molded,

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.180 align:middle line:90%
because you can't carve them.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.400 align:middle line:84%
You can't chip and shape
them into those shapes,

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.740 align:middle line:84%
because they will
flake and fragment

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:46.770 align:middle line:90%
as you start doing that.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So just molding stone
conjures up images of, well,

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:90%
how did you do that?

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.630 align:middle line:84%
It's only when you start
talking about sound.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And in all of human
history, it is sound

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.100 align:middle line:84%
that is referred to as
the source of all things,

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.500 align:middle line:84%
the divine creative
source of all things,

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.128 align:middle line:84%
the god with a big "G"
that we're referring to.

00:21:06.128 --> 00:21:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "First
there was the Word."

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Exactly.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.910 align:middle line:84%
"And God said, let
there be light."

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that the first
three verses of the Bible

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.060 align:middle line:84%
is probably a very elementary
introduction into quantum

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:20.690 align:middle line:84%
physics, how sound
combines with light,

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.880 align:middle line:84%
and together they activate
the infinite quantum

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.800 align:middle line:84%
soup of possibility and
manifest all this amazing stuff

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.750 align:middle line:90%
around us.

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are some of
the most far out estimates

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:34.210 align:middle line:84%
as to how old some of these
structures are From the patina?

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: I've spoken to some
of the world's leading experts

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:90%
on geology on patina growth.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:44.570 align:middle line:84%
They told me that the patina
growth that I'm talking about

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.660 align:middle line:84%
grows at about 1,000 years
per microscopic layer.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: And not much
is known about patina,

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:53.420 align:middle line:84%
because there have
been some studies done,

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:84%
but we're talking about
rough estimates here,

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.980 align:middle line:84%
but still, we're talking
about long periods of time.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:21:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: And
the estimates are

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:06.650 align:middle line:84%
anything between 50,000
to 300,000 years.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.420 align:middle line:84%
So you can't argue
with that, yeah?

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now let's
talk about the Annunaki

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and the species that, according
to Zachariah Sitchin's

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.900 align:middle line:84%
work, and then you would
extrapolate from that,

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:22.070 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that created
a worker bee species that

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.800 align:middle line:84%
were the ones who built
these artifacts, who

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.242 align:middle line:84%
built these stone circles
for a specific purpose.

00:22:27.242 --> 00:22:28.700 align:middle line:10%
You already mentioned
a moment ago,

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.630 align:middle line:10%
gold is central to this theme.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.860 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk
about the Annunaki,

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.610 align:middle line:10%
the backstory of the Annunaki.

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:36.590 align:middle line:10%
What happened, how
they bred this species?

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.573 align:middle line:10%
Because I find that fascinating.

00:22:38.573 --> 00:22:40.490 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah, the
Annunaki came to earth,

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:10%
according to Sitchin's
translations,

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:46.940 align:middle line:10%
430,000 odd years
ago looking for gold.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.590 align:middle line:10%
And boy, did they find it.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:50.540 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, does
it is it say anywhere

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:10%
in the Sumerian tablets that
he was using, among other data?

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Does it say why they
were looking for gold?

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Does it ever give--

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: It suggests why.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:07.610 align:middle line:84%
They used it for their
own physical immortality.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.490 align:middle line:84%
It suggests that
that's what they did.

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:12.830 align:middle line:84%
But more so than
that, it suggests

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:14.910 align:middle line:84%
that they used it to
protect their own planet.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: And that is
the most common answer

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:18.980 align:middle line:84%
that people give
you, but I don't

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:90%
know if I believe that anymore.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think these are the things
that Zakariah Sitchin would

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:26.300 align:middle line:84%
have probably adapted his
thinking, if he had known

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:84%
or seen what we found
in southern Africa,

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:84%
the physical evidence for
this vast gold-mining empire.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And they were mining
gold on a level

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.790 align:middle line:84%
that we can't even
begin to imagine.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And remember that
most of the gold

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.500 align:middle line:84%
the world, in all of human
history at this stage,

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.330 align:middle line:90%
has come out of southern Africa.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:46.028 align:middle line:90%
And it continues to do so.

00:23:46.028 --> 00:23:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
what is the evidence

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:52.070 align:middle line:84%
that gold was involved
near each of these sites?

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: First of all,
the Annunaki referred to--

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.280 align:middle line:84%
or the Sumerian tablets referred
to this place called the Abzu.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.080 align:middle line:10%
Now, many different
definitions have

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.970 align:middle line:10%
been given for the
Abzu and suggestions

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:04.460 align:middle line:10%
as to where the Abzu may
be, and that it's often

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.560 align:middle line:10%
referred to as Hell,
because it was believed

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:11.290 align:middle line:10%
to be underground or below
the surface of the Earth

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:12.090 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:15.350 align:middle line:84%
But I believe those are
all mistranslations,

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and the true translation of that
is that it's really the Abzu

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.680 align:middle line:84%
was the land below the equator,
where the gold came from.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.133 align:middle line:84%
So often when historians relate
to the Abzu, the land below,

00:24:26.133 --> 00:24:27.550 align:middle line:84%
they think, "oh,
below the ground?

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:28.730 align:middle line:90%
Well, it must be hell."

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:84%
No, it's the land
below the equator,

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.570 align:middle line:90%
where the gold came from.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is also, interestingly
enough, where I think the would

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:90%
"Abantu" comes from.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Abantu the name for the African
tribes from southern Africa,

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.000 align:middle line:84%
"Abantu" meaning "the
children of Antu"

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.460 align:middle line:90%
according to Credo Mutwa.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.315 align:middle line:90%
Who was Antu?

00:24:47.315 --> 00:24:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Antu was the Sumerian
goddess, the wife

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.660 align:middle line:84%
of Anu, the supreme
Commander of the Annunaki.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And we start seeing
some interesting links.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: But the golden
link is very, very important,

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:03.470 align:middle line:84%
because they refer over
and over again to, they're

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:07.310 align:middle line:84%
looking for gold and
finding it in the ground,

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:12.050 align:middle line:84%
in the ore of the
ground in the Abzu.

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And Enki, the
Sumerian entity who

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:19.520 align:middle line:84%
was put in charge of
the gold-mining exercise

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.910 align:middle line:84%
in the southern hemisphere,
in the Abzu, found gold,

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and that's where he established
his gold-mining empire.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.733 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, gold
comes up in Genesis.

00:25:27.733 --> 00:25:29.025 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Genesis 2 already.

00:25:29.025 --> 00:25:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 2, right.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Genesis 2.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is
really deeply embedded

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:35.790 align:middle line:84%
within our religious texts,
and not just the Bible, right?

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: And it's not
just encoded in as far back

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:40.550 align:middle line:90%
as Genesis 2.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And for people that
don't understand

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.200 align:middle line:84%
the importance of that,
it's that this is before Eve

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.730 align:middle line:90%
was created from Adam's rib.

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and that
part we have to get into.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.892 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: It's
really, really important.

00:25:50.892 --> 00:25:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Adam is alone on Earth, and
God comes to him in Genesis 2

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:84%
and says, "hey, buddy there's
this land called Havilah,

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.760 align:middle line:84%
where the land is good, the
water is good, and by the way,

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.010 align:middle line:90%
there is gold."

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.480 align:middle line:90%
So gotta say, hold on.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And in that one defining moment,
and I use that as the defining

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:08.710 align:middle line:84%
moment to separate god with
a big "G" and the gods,

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:12.320 align:middle line:84%
the Annunaki or the Elohim,
the biblical Elohim,

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.060 align:middle line:90%
the gods with the small "g."

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Just advanced human beings
who had advanced technology,

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.340 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge of cloning, and
the knowledge of manipulation,

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and they were looking for gold,
and it was their obsession

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:28.600 align:middle line:90%
that humanity inherited.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Our obsession with gold
doesn't come from us.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.210 align:middle line:90%
We inherited it from the gods.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And that can also be seen
echoed in the conquistadors

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:42.530 align:middle line:84%
and the colonialists that
came from Europe to occupy

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.870 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the world
some 500 years ago.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Every time they faced
a native population,

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:84%
whether it was in the Americas,
or in Africa, or in India,

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.810 align:middle line:84%
they somehow always
had huge amounts

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.280 align:middle line:90%
of gold, huge amounts of gold.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:58.433 align:middle line:90%

00:26:58.433 --> 00:26:59.567 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:26:59.567 --> 00:27:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: And when
they were asked, well,

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.500 align:middle line:84%
where does all this
gold come from, who

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.910 align:middle line:84%
does the gold belong to, it
was always the same answer.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.790 align:middle line:90%
The gold belongs to the gods.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.730 align:middle line:10%
And it is in that
defining moment,

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:15.590 align:middle line:10%
again, that we see
what a spectacular job

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:20.390 align:middle line:10%
the colonialists have done
to the native populations

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:24.560 align:middle line:10%
and those that then colonized
those native lands to separate

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.220 align:middle line:10%
us from our ancestors.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: And
today, we're behaving

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:29.990 align:middle line:90%
like a species with amnesia.

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:32.180 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea who we
are, where we come from,

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.690 align:middle line:84%
why are we here, while the
ancients seem to have been very

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:38.510 align:middle line:90%
clear on all those subjects.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.452 align:middle line:84%
Today, we think of our ancestors
as a bunch of stupid people

00:27:41.452 --> 00:27:42.410 align:middle line:90%
that lived in the past.

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:43.410 align:middle line:90%
They lived in the caves.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:44.750 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know anything.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:45.740 align:middle line:90%
That's how we see them.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:46.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Or that's what
we get taught to believe,

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:49.860 align:middle line:90%
in a way, through this system.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
have creationism

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.720 align:middle line:90%
or you have Darwinism.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Basically, people seem to
be divided in those camps.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:57.815 align:middle line:10%
But that's what's so exciting
about what you're doing,

00:27:57.815 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:10%
what Michael Cremo is doing and
some other people are doing,

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:06.020 align:middle line:10%
and that is we're
taking the species

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.230 align:middle line:10%
into a whole new understanding,
if we're open-minded,

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.630 align:middle line:10%
into a whole new
understanding of what we

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:13.483 align:middle line:10%
might have actually come from.

00:28:13.483 --> 00:28:14.900 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: Well,
what you say is

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.570 align:middle line:10%
so important, because
the whole creationist

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:21.950 align:middle line:10%
versus evolutionist argument
is completely irrelevant,

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:24.302 align:middle line:10%
because they're both accurate.

00:28:24.302 --> 00:28:26.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: There is a place
for truth in both of them.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:26.770 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah.

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:27.590 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.173 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: The
point is that there's

00:28:29.173 --> 00:28:31.910 align:middle line:84%
overwhelming evidence for
evolution of our planet,

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:34.910 align:middle line:84%
evolution of the solar
system, evolution of stuff

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:35.930 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.750 align:middle line:84%
But that does not mean
that we, as a species,

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:42.338 align:middle line:84%
are a product of evolution
here where we are today.

00:28:42.338 --> 00:28:44.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just that evidence
has never been presented.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We did not
crawl out of the sea.

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:45.980 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.030 align:middle line:90%
That link has not been made.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.322 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: And there's far
more overwhelming evidence

00:28:49.322 --> 00:28:51.110 align:middle line:10%
that we were somehow
genetically cloned.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And the translations
in the Sumerian tablets

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:56.690 align:middle line:84%
tell us over and over and over
again that the Annunaki came

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:59.030 align:middle line:84%
here looking for gold,
and they found it

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.610 align:middle line:84%
in spectacular amounts,
but they needed help

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:02.930 align:middle line:90%
to get it out of the ground.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:05.660 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And we need to start
opening our minds to this,

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:10%
because it may actually be
part of our history after all,

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:12.137 align:middle line:10%
and that is genetic manipulation
and cloning of species.

00:29:12.137 --> 00:29:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like to
do is, if you would get

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:18.410 align:middle line:84%
into a thumbnail sketch of the
translation of the Sumerian

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:21.350 align:middle line:84%
tablets and the
Annunaki manipulation

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:23.990 align:middle line:84%
and breeding of our species
and how that was done,

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.060 align:middle line:84%
because it's actually,
I think, fascinating.

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.268 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: Of course it is.

00:29:27.268 --> 00:29:31.730 align:middle line:10%
And just also to remind people
about genetic manipulation,

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.490 align:middle line:10%
most of the food we eat today
is genetically manipulated.

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:35.600 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You bet.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.225 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: If you
still have problems

00:29:37.225 --> 00:29:40.880 align:middle line:10%
trying to realize how easy

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.600 align:middle line:10%
genetically, stop.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Stop right now.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
not necessarily

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:47.450 align:middle line:84%
the most advanced
species in the universe.

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Well,
we think we are.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.260 align:middle line:90%
Our egos suggest we are, right?

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
assume we're not.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.197 align:middle line:84%
Let's assume others have come
before us and always have been.

00:29:55.197 --> 00:29:57.530 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at what the
Annunaki are said to have done

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and how that process
worked, because there

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.440 align:middle line:90%
were a lot of problems with it.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah, so
it tells us very clearly

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:06.530 align:middle line:84%
that the Annunaki
needed help, and they

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:12.200 align:middle line:84%
decided to clone a species
that could do the work

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.260 align:middle line:84%
to go into the ground
and extract the ore

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:19.278 align:middle line:84%
and get the gold, help them to
get the gold out of the ground.

00:30:19.278 --> 00:30:21.320 align:middle line:84%
They have to tell us very
clearly that they spent

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:25.257 align:middle line:84%
the first few 100,000
years getting the gold out

00:30:25.257 --> 00:30:27.215 align:middle line:84%
of the ground themselves,
and you're getting it

00:30:27.215 --> 00:30:28.910 align:middle line:84%
out of the water,
and out of the sand,

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and out of all kinds of
places, but it wasn't enough

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:33.710 align:middle line:90%
and they needed more gold.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's when Enki went, Enki
as in the brother of Enlil,

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.120 align:middle line:90%
the sons of Anu.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As in Annunaki.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: As in Annunaki.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And Enki went looking for more
sources of gold and found it.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's some amazing
references in the Sumerian

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:57.230 align:middle line:84%
translations that refer to
southern Africa and the Abzu

00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:00.180 align:middle line:84%
that he refers to, where
the gold was found.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
they settled there,

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and he established the
gold-mining headquarters there,

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:07.610 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the
species was cloned.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about the cloning process.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.030 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't quick.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.420 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't easy.

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.210 align:middle line:90%
It was a messy affair.

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: As it would be.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:19.340 align:middle line:10%
When you try to clone a
species that is smart enough

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.950 align:middle line:10%
to follow instructions
not get bored

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:25.610 align:middle line:10%
and wander off and start
doing its own thing,

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:29.960 align:middle line:10%
and be smart enough to use
advanced tools, not to endanger

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.510 align:middle line:10%

>>TELLINGER: To me,
it seems like it

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:46.510 align:middle line:10%
was some sort of a homo erectus
species in southern Africa,

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:50.670 align:middle line:10%
that the DNA genetic material
from homo erectus was taken,

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.420 align:middle line:10%
and it was blended
with the Annunaki DNA.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And it mentions
that in Bramley's book, too,

00:31:55.670 --> 00:32:01.100 align:middle line:10%
that a little bit of the essence
of the Annunaki was taken?

>>TELLINGER: Isn't
that beautiful?

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:07.010 align:middle line:10%
We refer to our DNA as
deoxyribonucleic acid.

>>TELLINGER: So we give
things such complicated names

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:20.270 align:middle line:10%
while the Sumerians

of what the DNA is?

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Because we understand it to

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:36.110 align:middle line:84%
this in the '50s, that it

responsible for what we are.

00:32:37.982 --> 00:32:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they
understood then,

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and so when they were first
bringing the first embryos

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.110 align:middle line:84%
to fruition, and then they
had to go through gestation,

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.200 align:middle line:84%
my understanding is, they
were trying to implant them

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.440 align:middle line:84%
into the human or the
homo erectus species,

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.550 align:middle line:90%

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.860 align:middle line:84%
first of all, before
we even get there,

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.070 align:middle line:84%
the translations,
Sitchin's translations,

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:07.010 align:middle line:84%
go into great detail
of how they tried

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of cloning and
crossing genetic material

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:12.800 align:middle line:84%
they tried, and they tried
all kinds of species.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.300 align:middle line:90%
It just didn't work.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.970 align:middle line:84%
They tried animal cloning
and all kinds of things,

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and I believe it's in those
translations that you see some

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.570 align:middle line:84%
startling and quite horrific
imagery of half-man,

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:25.452 align:middle line:90%
half-lion--

00:33:25.452 --> 00:33:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Our mythology
is based on this.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Exactly.

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Exactly.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And then they tried the homo
erectus and the Annunaki DNA,

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and they found that
was a good blend.

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:39.860 align:middle line:84%
But then they still didn't
know how to actually bring

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.120 align:middle line:90%
that being forward.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, the females of
the homo erectus didn't work.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.450 align:middle line:10%
And then they realized they
had to impregnate the Annunaki

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:54.410 align:middle line:10%
females with the fertilized
egg or fertilized

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:58.220 align:middle line:10%
material of this new creature.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And that brings us to a
very important discovery

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:04.520 align:middle line:84%
among these 10 million stone
ruins in southern Africa

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.830 align:middle line:84%
that Johann Heine
discovered by accident,

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:10.730 align:middle line:84%
or should I say rediscovered
by accident in 2003,

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:12.230 align:middle line:84%
and for five years
tried to bring it

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:15.050 align:middle line:84%
to the attention of the
authorities until he met me,

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:16.252 align:middle line:90%
and then everything changed.

00:34:16.252 --> 00:34:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:19.252 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Because I
realized that, once again,

00:34:19.252 --> 00:34:20.780 align:middle line:90%
this is a very important place.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.090 align:middle line:84%
It's what we now
call Adam's Calendar.

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:25.250 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
Adam in the Bible,

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:29.000 align:middle line:10%
the allegory of Adam and
Eve, the original being

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.210 align:middle line:10%
that was successfully brought
forth was called Adamu.

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:33.170 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Adamu.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I believe,
obviously, the Bible gets Adam,

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:39.739 align:middle line:84%
and Annunaki translations
call him Adamu.

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:42.320 align:middle line:90%
And it is at Adam's Calendar.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And when I called it
"Adam's Calendar,"

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.780 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize how close
to the truth I would be.

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.820 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's get the
Credo Mutwa piece in here.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yes.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The famous shaman.

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: This
is very important.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.449 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he's really
very, very elderly now.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:57.116 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah,
Credo is probably not

00:34:57.116 --> 00:34:59.450 align:middle line:10%
gonna be with us for
very much longer,

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:03.050 align:middle line:10%
and he has shared spectacular
information and knowledge

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:03.900 align:middle line:10%
with the world.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And much of what I write about
and much of the knowledge

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:11.270 align:middle line:84%
that I've gained has
come from Credo himself.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And when he saw my book
on Adam's Calendar, when

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.900 align:middle line:84%
I presented it to him,
he broke into tears.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.730 align:middle line:90%
He started to cry.

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And he told me he was initiated
in 1937 as a young shaman,

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:28.933 align:middle line:84%
and that it is known as the
birthplace of humankind.

00:35:28.933 --> 00:35:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In his
lore passed down.

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And isn't he the
last of the Zulu shaman

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:34.670 align:middle line:90%
with that level?

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:36.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, with that
level of knowledge?

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah, yeah.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.680 align:middle line:84%
There will be others,
obviously, but right now he

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.860 align:middle line:84%
is the supreme Zulu shaman
with all this knowledge

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.370 align:middle line:84%
that he's shared with the world
to the best of his ability.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what you
are finding is supported.

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: He knew about
that for decades and decades,

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and the African
ancient knowledge

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.930 align:middle line:90%
systems have known about it.

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's referred to in Zulu
as in "Inzalo y'Langa," which

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:04.280 align:middle line:84%
means "birthplace of the sun,"
not necessarily the S-U-N

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:08.240 align:middle line:84%
but the S-O-N, the
son of the Annunaki,

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.740 align:middle line:90%
the sons of the Annunaki.

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What did the Zulu?

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.898 align:middle line:10%
What did the Zulu try
to call the Annunaki?

00:36:14.898 --> 00:36:16.190 align:middle line:10%
Did they have a different name?

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.688 align:middle line:10%
What were the sky
gods referred to as?

00:36:18.688 --> 00:36:21.230 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: Well, they're often
referred to as the abelungu.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:22.060 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.540 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: The sky
gods, the pale sky gods.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:24.980 align:middle line:10%
And this is another
interesting thing.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:25.580 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The pale sky gods.

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.122 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: All
the ancient cultures

00:36:27.122 --> 00:36:28.580 align:middle line:84%
seemed to refer
to these sky gods

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.690 align:middle line:84%
and the color of their skin
as being pale sky gods.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's very important
to put that into context

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:38.170 align:middle line:84%
as to what was going on
and who these beings were,

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:39.490 align:middle line:90%
what they looked like.

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:41.200 align:middle line:84%
In the Sumerian
translations, Enki

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.630 align:middle line:84%
is often described
as having a pale skin

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:50.530 align:middle line:84%
and hair the color of the sun
and eyes the color of the sky.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need
to be a genius

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:56.920 align:middle line:84%
to figure out that he was of
an Aryan kind of heritage.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.630 align:middle line:10%
And I know that there's
some people that

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:00.700 align:middle line:10%
have problems with those,
but I'll stick to that

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.920 align:middle line:10%
until I find other evidence.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:08.062 align:middle line:10%
And the creator god in
the Sumerian tablets,

00:37:08.062 --> 00:37:09.520 align:middle line:10%
according to
Zachariah Sitchin, who

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.060 align:middle line:10%
is Enki or the geneticist
that started the whole thing,

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.690 align:middle line:10%
it was not only Enki, it was
also his sister, Ninhursag,

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:19.630 align:middle line:10%
and one of his sons,
and Ningishzidda,

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:24.100 align:middle line:10%
who are the medical experts and
the geneticists that actually

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.690 align:middle line:10%
were the hands-on people.

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:29.830 align:middle line:84%
So it was actually a female that
did the genetic manipulation

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:31.930 align:middle line:90%
and not Enki himself.

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:35.278 align:middle line:90%
So she was referred to as Mami.

00:37:35.278 --> 00:37:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
believe, and Sitchin

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.910 align:middle line:84%
believes that the word
"mama" or "ma" comes from.

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ma, Mom, Mommy.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.922 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Comes from,
and "mother" comes from,

00:37:41.922 --> 00:37:44.330 align:middle line:90%
the original creative female.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:47.530 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: And
then they took the--

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:50.420 align:middle line:10%
it was at Adam's Calendar,
or Enki's Calendar,

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.320 align:middle line:10%
as I now call it, because
there's overwhelming evidence

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:56.710 align:middle line:10%
to show that Enki constructed
this calendar site

00:37:56.710 --> 00:38:00.130 align:middle line:10%
that Johann Heine rediscovered.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was at Enki's Calendar
that they actually did

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:07.570 align:middle line:84%
the insertion or
implanted the fertilized

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:09.580 align:middle line:90%
eggs into the Annunaki females.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:10.960 align:middle line:90%
So it was like a ritual site.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was gonna
say, ritual, yeah.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.660 align:middle line:10%
>>TELLINGER: And from there,
I think in Hindu tradition

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:20.260 align:middle line:10%
and Hindu mythology, they
become the seven birth mothers

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:23.470 align:middle line:10%
or the seventh birth goddesses,
that they were originally

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:24.670 align:middle line:10%
the seven Annunaki females.

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this calendar
lines up very specifically

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:28.420 align:middle line:90%
with the sun.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so we're looking at the
rituals likely to have aligned

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:36.290 align:middle line:84%
with certain astronomical or
astrological configurations,

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:37.780 align:middle line:84%
for example, perhaps
when they were

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.197 align:middle line:84%
going through this
cloning process

00:38:39.197 --> 00:38:40.495 align:middle line:90%
and creating this species.

00:38:40.495 --> 00:38:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah, it's not just
the alignment of the solstices

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.640 align:middle line:90%
and the equinoxes and so forth.

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.780 align:middle line:90%
It is a highly energetic site.

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So now another thing that
we haven't had a chance

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:53.200 align:middle line:84%
to get into much, and we
have just a few minutes left,

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and that is the anomalous
artifacts around there.

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:59.283 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing, I love
this picture, the big foot.

00:38:59.283 --> 00:39:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Oh, yeah.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The big footprint.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yes.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have the
gigantic footprint that

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:06.220 align:middle line:90%
is very difficult to explain.

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.250 align:middle line:84%
We have Klaus Dona,
and I had the pleasure

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.270 align:middle line:84%
of sitting with him in
his apartment in Vienna.

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:12.978 align:middle line:84%
And he brought out
some of the artifacts.

00:39:12.978 --> 00:39:13.990 align:middle line:90%
And one of them was--

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and it goes with
this footprint, it

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.150 align:middle line:84%
was the occipital bone,
occipital bone of somebody,

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:22.600 align:middle line:84%
a human, a human occipital
bone, of somebody who was

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.938 align:middle line:84%
And it's in granite, and
everyone jumps up and down

00:39:37.938 --> 00:39:39.730 align:middle line:84%
says, well, it's
impossible for a footprint

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:40.770 align:middle line:90%
to be made into granite.

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:41.800 align:middle line:90%
I said, I know.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.260 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to give me
that geological lesson.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:45.843 align:middle line:90%
I've had it 1,000 times.

00:39:45.843 --> 00:39:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how
did it get there?

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: I do have an idea.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is your theory?

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.662 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: Yes,
it's not my theory.

00:39:50.662 --> 00:39:54.760 align:middle line:84%
This is what was e-mailed me
by a gold explorer from Canada.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:58.330 align:middle line:84%
He says he's been doing gold
exploration for decades.

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:00.010 align:middle line:84%
It's part of his
family tradition.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:01.630 align:middle line:84%
He says he knows
exactly how this

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:05.270 align:middle line:84%
happened, that because in Canada
they get gold out of granite.

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: They crush
it up into a sludge,

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:10.030 align:middle line:84%
and they extract
the gold somehow,

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and then they leave
behind a slurry of granite

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:15.130 align:middle line:90%
like wet cement.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:18.670 align:middle line:84%
After a while, the
granite gets hard again.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And if, during that process
while it's hardening,

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:23.242 align:middle line:84%
you step into it,
it'll behave like mud

00:40:23.242 --> 00:40:25.450 align:middle line:84%
and leave behind a footprint
pretty much like the one

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:26.290 align:middle line:90%
that I show.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:28.965 align:middle line:84%
He says, to him, that
makes absolute sense.

00:40:28.965 --> 00:40:31.090 align:middle line:84%
He has no problem believing
that that footprint was

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:34.960 align:middle line:84%
made by a real humanoid person
that was 7 and 1/2 meters tall.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These people,
by the way, whoever

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:38.180 align:middle line:90%
did this work disappeared.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yes.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There is no physical
evidence for this species that

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:42.040 align:middle line:90%
was cloned.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which I can probably
add a couple explanations,

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and so can you,
but we don't need

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:48.640 align:middle line:90%
to get into the speculation.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.510 align:middle line:90%
They have disappeared.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.440 align:middle line:90%
They could've been taken out.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.148 align:middle line:84%
Any number of things
could have happened.

00:40:52.148 --> 00:40:53.380 align:middle line:90%
Which makes it difficult.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: That's the
biggest mystery, really.

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:58.000 align:middle line:84%
We've got more than 10
million stone ruins,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and we need to reiterate once
again, these are not dwellings.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:02.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: These
are workplaces

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:06.090 align:middle line:90%
and energy-generating devices.

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:07.840 align:middle line:84%
We can say this because
we've measured it.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.403 align:middle line:84%
We're not just saying it because
I have a warm, fuzzy feeling

00:41:10.403 --> 00:41:11.570 align:middle line:90%
that they're energy devices.

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:14.090 align:middle line:84%
They are spectacular
energy devices.

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:14.890 align:middle line:90%
No dwellings.

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:17.123 align:middle line:84%
What happened to
millions of people?

00:41:17.123 --> 00:41:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To build
10 million structures

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:21.383 align:middle line:84%
had to have been millions
upon millions of inhabitants.

00:41:21.383 --> 00:41:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: No bones.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:22.480 align:middle line:90%
No bones.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No bones.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.580 align:middle line:90%
So we're finding these.

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:27.100 align:middle line:84%
We're finding the three
or four footprint.

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:30.700 align:middle line:84%
We're finding the femur bone
of someone nine feet tall,

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:31.500 align:middle line:90%
roughly.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.470 align:middle line:84%
So basically what we're
seeing is between all of that,

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:37.260 align:middle line:84%
there were many different
iterations of whatever it

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:38.940 align:middle line:90%
is that we have become today.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there have
been other species that

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.710 align:middle line:84%
introduced their own DNA into
it and were actually present

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:45.170 align:middle line:84%
once upon a time
upon the planet.

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah.

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so we could be
seeing some of their artifacts,

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.360 align:middle line:84%
because perhaps we're made
in their likeness, right?

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:50.800 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Exactly.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that kind
of where we're going?

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: And I think Kerry
Cassidy puts it so beautifully.

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:56.100 align:middle line:84%
She says, you know,
this planet has

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:59.340 align:middle line:84%
been like a Petri dish
of genetic experiments,

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:02.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's just like we've just
been so genetically manipulated

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and crossed so many times that
it's really difficult to try

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.515 align:middle line:90%
and pinpoint the source.

00:42:06.515 --> 00:42:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what
you've done is

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:11.310 align:middle line:84%
discover the best evidence
for what truly does

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:12.610 align:middle line:90%
exist physically at this time.

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Yeah.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For a
lost civilization.

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:16.702 align:middle line:84%
>>TELLINGER: And is
still active and alive,

00:42:16.702 --> 00:42:19.410 align:middle line:84%
and is giving us infinite
amounts of energy

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:22.058 align:middle line:84%
into which I hope we will
tap into very, very soon.

00:42:22.058 --> 00:42:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I hope so, too.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.017 align:middle line:84%
And Michael, thank you
so much for joining us.

00:42:25.017 --> 00:42:26.308 align:middle line:90%
>>TELLINGER: Thank you, Regina.

00:42:26.308 --> 00:42:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I really
appreciate your time.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.388 align:middle line:90%
Loads of fuel for thought.

00:42:29.388 --> 00:42:31.680 align:middle line:84%
The most important aspect,
though, of this kind of work

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.200 align:middle line:84%
is that we begin to honor
one another's perceptions.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not about being
right or wrong,

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:39.210 align:middle line:84%
but piecing together an
amazing portrait of our past,

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:41.370 align:middle line:90%
if we can hear each other out.

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thanks for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
