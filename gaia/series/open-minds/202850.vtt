>>REGINA MEREDITH: How
many vitamins and minerals

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.740 align:middle line:10%
do you have in your cabinet?

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.460 align:middle line:10%
If you're like me, it's dozens
of bottles, mostly half used.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, if
you were to take

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.270 align:middle line:84%
a peek inside your
stomach, you would also

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.000 align:middle line:90%
see most of them half digested.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.880 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Dennis.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:90%
This is fun.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Everybody behind the scenes
here, the crew, everybody's

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.363 align:middle line:84%
been talking to you
about what you do,

00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:39.840 align:middle line:90%
because it is really exciting.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.640 align:middle line:90%
And I have to just set this up.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Zeus, my husband, and I
were researching COVID.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.253 align:middle line:84%
We did tons of
research on it, just

00:00:47.253 --> 00:00:49.170 align:middle line:84%
trying to look at the
truth behind everything.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.770 align:middle line:90%
What can we do?

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And we came across
some articles that

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.890 align:middle line:84%
talked about this odd thing
about certain receptors

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:84%
in the lungs having
to do with nicotine,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and so we started
questioning, jeez, I

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.923 align:middle line:84%
wonder if people use nicotine
patches, if that would help?

00:01:02.923 --> 00:01:04.590 align:middle line:84%
It turns out they're
doing it in France.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.200 align:middle line:84%
They were very limited because
you couldn't even buy them.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And then he stumbled
upon you and found out

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:90%
that you can get--

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.617 align:middle line:84%
not just nicotine, but
nutrients delivered via patches.

00:01:17.617 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I got excited
and did my first interview

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.783 align:middle line:90%
with you on my site.

00:01:20.783 --> 00:01:21.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's so fun.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.850 align:middle line:84%
We had to bring your
story here to Gaia.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS SHEPHERD: Well, I
appreciate that very much,

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.540 align:middle line:90%
and thank you for having me.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: It's a pleasure.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is just,
to me, so fascinating

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.240 align:middle line:90%
for so many reasons.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.520 align:middle line:84%
It's hopeful for
so many reasons.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I think we need
to go to your own story, which

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.870 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned, half digested
pills in the stomach.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Right.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which used to
witness as a pathologist.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Right.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were
present at autopsies.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Right.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.578 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I want you to
just kind of tell us what

00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:48.360 align:middle line:90%
you found in people's stomachs.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:10%
>>SHEPHERD: Well, years,
and years, and years ago,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:10%
it was seen that undigested
pills and powders,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.220 align:middle line:10%
people coming in
there were athletes,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.610 align:middle line:10%
had a regimen of taking
25, 30, 50 pills a day,

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.810 align:middle line:10%
and having issues
with those pills--

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.610 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: --being
undigested in the stomach

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.450 align:middle line:90%
and in the lower intestines.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it isn't just
older people that have--

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: No.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --low
digestive enzymes,

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.520 align:middle line:84%
for example, because
I thought maybe

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.840 align:middle line:90%
it would have been the elderly.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: No, no.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
is that younger people,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.120 align:middle line:84%
because that's all they
had, were pills and vitamin

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.420 align:middle line:90%
supplements.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And they were over
supplementing themselves

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.000 align:middle line:84%
to help with whatever activity
they were really involved with.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.550 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that pills
are 95% filler and binder,

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and the filler and
binder can be sand.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:90%
It can be rice.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.210 align:middle line:84%
It can be pebbles ground
up, and that is the glue

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.470 align:middle line:90%
that holds a pill together.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I mean, the--

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.690 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the FDA doesn't oversee
these supplements per se.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.115 align:middle line:84%
So are you saying it's common
to have kind of trashy binders?

00:02:57.115 --> 00:02:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: I'm not--

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.358 align:middle line:90%
I can't define that--

00:02:59.358 --> 00:03:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just
saying I wouldn't want--

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: --because
I don't know.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I take-- I take
vitamins and minerals, right?

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Right.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
kind of off-putting

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.270 align:middle line:84%
to think that those kinds of
things might be in the binding.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And I know that some-- you have
much more high quality versus

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.010 align:middle line:90%
low quality--

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Sure, sure.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --ingredients
depending on the company

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:90%
and their integrity.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Right.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, to me, binders
and fillers are one thing.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.067 align:middle line:90%
It's the cement that keeps--

00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It all together.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: --the
powder together.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.460 align:middle line:84%
There's the only one
thing that does that.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: And as
you're mixing cement,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:84%
you're mixing it with rock,
and you're mixing it with sand.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: In order
to get a solid.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: And that's
what we've found.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.922 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So as far as--

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: As far as
that, those things.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those fillers
were not breaking down.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: They were
not breaking down.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if they're
not breaking down,

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.988 align:middle line:84%
they're not releasing
the nutrients

00:03:38.988 --> 00:03:40.855 align:middle line:84%
to the digestive system
and blood stream?

00:03:40.855 --> 00:03:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Well,
they're not-- they're

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.015 align:middle line:84%
not doing any good for you
is what the problem is.

00:03:45.015 --> 00:03:46.870 align:middle line:84%
So you might get, just
so you understand--

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: --is that a pill--

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.280 align:middle line:84%
let's say a 300
milligram vitamin

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.680 align:middle line:84%
could consist of really
only 30 milligrams

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.500 align:middle line:84%
of the actual ingredient,
because the rest is all filler

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.580 align:middle line:90%
and binder.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now
what about the gel caps?

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people would
say, they must melt.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.485 align:middle line:84%
That would be much better, you
know, by way of oral stuff,

00:04:06.485 --> 00:04:06.590 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: But
again, everything

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.608 align:middle line:84%
that goes through the
digestive system-- you're

00:04:09.608 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:84%
going to lose 60%,
70% of that product

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.923 align:middle line:90%
because it's going to be waste.

00:04:13.923 --> 00:04:15.840 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's going to go
right through the-- right

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.120 align:middle line:84%
through the body, and
you're going to excrete it.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.029 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: So it's not
actually getting into--

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.820 align:middle line:84%
the bioavailability of the
liquids, the sublinguals,

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.750 align:middle line:84%
the gel caps, and all of those
things is like anything else

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.790 align:middle line:84%
that you put orally
into the body.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.650 align:middle line:84%
It has to go through
the digestive system,

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and then it goes
through the liver,

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.378 align:middle line:84%
and it goes through
the digestive system,

00:04:34.378 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:84%
and then it's excreted
out of the body.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:90%
How much do you actually get?

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.270 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it really--

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.070 align:middle line:84%
the studies show
that you might end up

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.120 align:middle line:84%
with 18%, 20% maximum of the
actual ingredient of a pill,

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.790 align:middle line:84%
powder, sublingual,
liquid in the body.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
not age dependent?

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: It's not
age dependent at all.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody's body
metabolizes differently.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: That's a fact.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.413 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: And everybody's
bioavailability,

00:04:58.413 --> 00:05:01.170 align:middle line:84%
depending on their skin
type, is different,

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:06.450 align:middle line:84%
but we have learned that
a patch put on the body,

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.933 align:middle line:90%
on the skin goes right to the--

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bloodstream.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: --bloodstream, which
is where you want this to go.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes through all
of the organs in the body,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting 70%, 80%
of the actual ingredients

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.510 align:middle line:84%
that you need for
supplementation in the body.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, well,
that's why I was

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.160 align:middle line:84%
excited about doing
the interview with you

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.190 align:middle line:84%
after we stumbled onto
you, because it just

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:84%
makes sense to me, because I
know my digestion is so-so.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, I know I have a
lot of half empty bottles,

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:84%
or half full, or
2/3 full bottles,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:84%
because I can't really
feel the difference.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll just try something
for a while and then just let

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.220 align:middle line:84%
it sit there, waiting to
feel kind of the charge

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.183 align:middle line:84%
or feel the difference,
like a lot of people

00:05:43.183 --> 00:05:44.850 align:middle line:84%
have been going through
that are looking

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:45.868 align:middle line:90%
to improve their health.

00:05:45.868 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we take it
in our own hands.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.230 align:middle line:84%
There are no MDs that
are going to tell us

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.230 align:middle line:90%
about these supplements.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.162 align:middle line:84%
We have to just--
it's trial by fire.

00:05:52.162 --> 00:05:53.370 align:middle line:90%
We just have to play with it.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Absolutely.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.795 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that's
what we're all doing.

00:05:55.795 --> 00:06:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So the notion that nicotine has
traditionally been delivered

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:84%
this way for so many
years, it's-- first of all,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.490 align:middle line:84%
why hasn't this happened
a long time ago?

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.673 align:middle line:90%
Because it is logical.

00:06:07.673 --> 00:06:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: As far as patch
and vitamin supplements?

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Patch and
nutrients, yeah.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Well, only
because of the fact

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:84%
that you have to take
through the new technology

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.910 align:middle line:90%
of the nanotechnology before.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Patches have been
around since 1979,

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.850 align:middle line:84%
again, with your nicotine
patch, your estrogen patch, even

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.000 align:middle line:84%
your Demerol, you know, your
pain patches in hospitals

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.790 align:middle line:84%
for the elderly or for the
young with collapsed veins,

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:30.810 align:middle line:90%
no way to get--

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.240 align:middle line:84%
administer anything
into the body.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.170 align:middle line:90%
There was patches.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:39.150 align:middle line:84%
The only problem was that they
weren't able to dose properly

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.490 align:middle line:90%
those ingredients.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So we had a lot of issues with
the pain patches for sure,

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.400 align:middle line:90%
and it became a big issue.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
With the nicotine
patch, everybody

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:84%
knows nicotine patches do
work to a certain extent,

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:84%
but why would you want to put
poison back into your body

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.280 align:middle line:84%
in order to get you
to stop smoking.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.150 align:middle line:84%
That's something
I'm totally against.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
the only thing most of us

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.990 align:middle line:84%
even knew existed
in the patch world.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.198 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Exactly, exactly.

00:07:01.198 --> 00:07:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
estrogen patch,

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.020 align:middle line:84%
those things that work--
there's no doubt about it.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.240 align:middle line:84%
You can see that
through your blood work,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.610 align:middle line:90%
and that's all well and good.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.010 align:middle line:84%
However, once again, you're
not getting nutrients.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.530 align:middle line:84%
You're not getting the
supplementation the body really

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.920 align:middle line:84%
needs to work
properly in my eyes.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.220 align:middle line:84%
So patches evolved
from that, and when

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.138 align:middle line:84%
I got involved-- over 15 years
now I've been doing this,

00:07:26.138 --> 00:07:27.180 align:middle line:90%
and really be innovative.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.722 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
you make that leap,

00:07:28.722 --> 00:07:30.420 align:middle line:84%
as from a pathologist
to getting--

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.648 align:middle line:90%
doing this patch technology?

00:07:31.648 --> 00:07:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: It was real simple.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.920 align:middle line:84%
I got involved with the
state of California,

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and they asked me to be involved
with them on a proposition that

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.930 align:middle line:84%
would help drug and alcohol
patients or offenders, if you

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:44.730 align:middle line:90%
will--

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.900 align:middle line:90%
keep them out of jail.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.400 align:middle line:84%
The jails were
overcrowded, and they

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.100 align:middle line:84%
wanted first and
second time offenders

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.820 align:middle line:84%
to have alternatives to jail
and get them in treatment.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.660 align:middle line:90%
They need treatment.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.410 align:middle line:90%
They need help.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.562 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: And so they
asked me to come up

00:07:57.562 --> 00:08:01.320 align:middle line:84%
with some type of detection
product that I could use.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Back then, there was only a five
panel test, a urine test that

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:07.830 align:middle line:84%
would test for just
the methamphetamine,

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and the marijuana THC, the
opioids, the diazepines.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And so they said we've got
all these new drugs out there,

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.940 align:middle line:84%
and these date rape drugs,
and all these things.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Can you come up with something?

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.100 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.500 align:middle line:84%
I came up with a 10
panel drug test kit--

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.410 align:middle line:84%
that we made it portable that
probation officers could use

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.210 align:middle line:90%
in their cars and their kits.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:90%
And it worked a lot better.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.950 align:middle line:90%
And so I was on to something.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.490 align:middle line:84%
State of California
was behind me.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.900 align:middle line:90%
It worked.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.120 align:middle line:84%
It was a chain of
custody product.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.390 align:middle line:84%
It was great, and so all
of a sudden I'm going,

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.617 align:middle line:90%
well, I can do this.

00:08:40.617 --> 00:08:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Then I started getting
into pregnancy tests.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I was getting into the
home test products.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: And it was--

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.860 align:middle line:90%
it was just exciting.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Then a friend of mine
came over from China,

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Dennis, I've
got this patch for hangovers.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:00.840 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, sure.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:02.640 align:middle line:90%
He says, no, no, no.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.765 align:middle line:90%
You've got to look at this.

00:09:03.765 --> 00:09:05.020 align:middle line:90%
This is fantastic.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.610 align:middle line:90%
It's called hangover free.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:07.410 align:middle line:90%
I looked at it.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:08.520 align:middle line:90%
I studied it.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.060 align:middle line:84%
We did kind of a group study,
if you will, with kids--

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.980 align:middle line:90%
college kids, elderly, women.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, go
to a college campus.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.925 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Especially women--
yeah, exactly-- that drink

00:09:16.925 --> 00:09:19.450 align:middle line:84%
wine because they normally
get a hangover with a couple

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:20.250 align:middle line:90%
glasses of red.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: And so we found
that it actually worked and that

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:24.810 align:middle line:90%
the ingredients--

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:90%
I was so intrigued.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.080 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
these ingredients--

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.520 align:middle line:84%
you know, all these
ingredients into one patch.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And so through science,
reverse engineering,

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.990 align:middle line:84%
we found out that they were
able to take these ingredients,

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.660 align:middle line:84%
reduce the molecular
weight of a lot of them,

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.180 align:middle line:84%
put them on a patch, and they
go through the bloodstream.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.403 align:middle line:90%
Great, great, great idea.

00:09:43.403 --> 00:09:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, then, all of a sudden,
the light bulb goes on.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:46.653 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And here we are.

00:09:46.653 --> 00:09:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Why can't you do
all your vitamins, nutrients?

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how it started,
and it's really that easy,

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.640 align:middle line:84%
going into a lab and start
taking all of these products

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.290 align:middle line:90%
with evolving science.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.150 align:middle line:90%
The science is key to this.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.290 align:middle line:84%
The nanotechnology aspect of
what we're able to do today--

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.130 align:middle line:90%
encapsulation.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:84%
We're able to take the highest
potency of each ingredient,

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.960 align:middle line:84%
the vitamin D, the Bs-- all the
Bs-- the Bs 3s, 5s, 6s, 12s,

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:90%
all those things--

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and reduce them into the
molecular weight, the smallest

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:84%
transferable ingredient now that
we have, and put it on a patch.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:25.630 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.100 align:middle line:90%
It actually worked.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And so again it just opened
up a whole new idea of,

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.860 align:middle line:84%
why can't we do
all the vitamins?

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: And that's
what we started doing.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.917 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you started
working with some universities,

00:10:38.917 --> 00:10:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and what I want to do is get
to this, the project where

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.750 align:middle line:84%
you started working with
bariatrics patients, which

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:44.800 align:middle line:90%
is stomach stapling.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Yes.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, because this--

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.370 align:middle line:84%
I have a cousin who died
because she drank alcohol

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.200 align:middle line:90%
after her stomach stapling.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And she had had an
alcohol problem before,

00:10:55.690 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and the body just can't--
does not metabolize anything

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.990 align:middle line:90%
the same way.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: No, no.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so--

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Absorption
of alcohol, yes.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:03.825 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Horrid.

00:11:03.825 --> 00:11:04.625 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Horrid.

00:11:04.625 --> 00:11:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we know
the downside of that.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.140 align:middle line:84%
We know that they also
can't absorb nutrients well.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Right.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
what you did in that field.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Well, this
is really exciting.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:84%
This is how this really
blew up in my eyes--

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that,
when you get hospital,

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and clinics, and physicians
behind you in a certain group--

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and this was a fantastic study
that we did with the post--

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.338 align:middle line:84%
well, pre and post
bariatric surgery patients.

00:11:32.338 --> 00:11:33.880 align:middle line:84%
You have to meet
certain requirements

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.545 align:middle line:84%
to even be considered
for bariatric surgery.

00:11:36.545 --> 00:11:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Usually
it's extreme obesity.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.587 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: It is
extreme obesity.

00:11:39.587 --> 00:11:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And what you need to do
is be at a certain weight,

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:43.510 align:middle line:90%
and that is a fact.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.660 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be able to have
enough nutrients and minerals

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:51.220 align:middle line:84%
in the body to support the
surgery, because post surgery,

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
a pouch this big,

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.430 align:middle line:84%
and you're not going to be
able to take 25 pills a day--

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: --to supplement
and get all the nutrients

00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.710 align:middle line:84%
and everything, because
you're not going

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:90%
to get it through food anymore.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to get
it through drinking shakes

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:03.630 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.210 align:middle line:90%
All those things go away.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.170 align:middle line:84%
So how do you
supplement the body?

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.160 align:middle line:90%
You do it through the patches.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.720 align:middle line:84%
So we worked with bariatric
surgeons and surgery centers

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.860 align:middle line:84%
across the country to
the most greatest effect

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle line:84%
by having them give me
ideas of what they need,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.950 align:middle line:84%
what these patients
need, and they

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.270 align:middle line:90%
would give me formulations.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'd go in the
lab and say, OK, we

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.403 align:middle line:84%
can do this, this, and
this, but we can't do that.

00:12:31.403 --> 00:12:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And so we'd put our
heads together again

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, if
we didn't do that,

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.015 align:middle line:84%
we can supplement this by
adding this, this, and this.

00:12:37.015 --> 00:12:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, we
came up with products

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.760 align:middle line:84%
that were absolutely unique to
post surgery bariatric patients

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.310 align:middle line:84%
to where they're getting
the supplementation where

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:46.180 align:middle line:90%
they need today.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's absolutely fantastic.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.480 align:middle line:90%
Labs don't lie.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.320 align:middle line:90%
That's a key.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: And all of these
patients had a baseline.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.550 align:middle line:84%
They had their
pills, and powders,

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and all of that,
and the baseline

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:57.600 align:middle line:84%
was with those
particular products.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And they knew where their levels
were, where their vitamin D

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.930 align:middle line:84%
levels were, where
their hemoglobin was,

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.050 align:middle line:84%
where their Bs were, the
most essential nutrients

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.270 align:middle line:90%
that the body needs.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:90%
Get them off of that.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.415 align:middle line:84%
They have their surgery,
post surgery, and put them

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:13.510 align:middle line:84%
on a patch, and get their
labs in 30, 60 days.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.410 align:middle line:84%
They saw where
their levels were.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.770 align:middle line:84%
For instance, their D levels
might have been at 7 or 8,

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.950 align:middle line:84%
and now, all of the sudden after
30 or 45 days, their levels

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:24.730 align:middle line:90%
are 28 by just using the patch.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Now we're really
on to something.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.990 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't just with one
patient, or 10 patients,

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:30.100 align:middle line:90%
or 100 patients.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of patients
are testimony,

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.170 align:middle line:84%
coming out, saying
this is my lab.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:37.390 align:middle line:90%
They do not lie.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Now what happens?

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.320 align:middle line:84%
The doctors are like, oh
my gosh, this really works.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And now you've got
doctors behind you.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.413 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because normally
they're not that interested

00:13:45.413 --> 00:13:46.330 align:middle line:90%
in nutrient delivery--

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: They are not.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.347 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --because they're
not even trained in it.

00:13:49.347 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: No, absolutely not.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.902 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So this is really--

00:13:50.902 --> 00:13:52.360 align:middle line:84%
this is getting
kind of interesting

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:84%
because you have created an
excitement about nutrients

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.780 align:middle line:84%
themselves within some of these
universities you've worked for.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Exactly
right, and a lot of them

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:01.995 align:middle line:90%
use the products today.

00:14:01.995 --> 00:14:03.620 align:middle line:84%
They're still using
the products today,

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.880 align:middle line:90%
which is absolutely fantastic.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.347 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: And so
supplementation we've

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:11.563 align:middle line:84%
learned now is just exploded in
that regard technology again.

00:14:11.563 --> 00:14:12.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to technology.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:16.420 align:middle line:10%
The really exciting thing is
nanotechnology, encapsulation,

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.260 align:middle line:10%
what we do--

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.720 align:middle line:10%
the bioavailability
is so much better now

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:10%
with how we are
using accelerators

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.090 align:middle line:10%
unique to each
particular product.

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And again, proprietary
information I

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:27.790 align:middle line:90%
will not talk about.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.180 align:middle line:84%
However, the products
work only because of what

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.853 align:middle line:90%
the labs results are today.

00:14:32.853 --> 00:14:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it
time release then?

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.217 align:middle line:90%
You're not--

00:14:35.217 --> 00:14:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: It his time release.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Again, let's go back
to the technology.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.630 align:middle line:84%
The great thing, again,
about the technology

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and what we're talking about,
nanotechnology, and the ability

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:50.740 align:middle line:84%
to use a polymeric, non-woven
product with an adhesive that

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:84%
is proven hypoallergenic
and non-harmful to the skin.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.360 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to
have a well system.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And as the body
takes that patch,

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and as the patch is
worn throughout the day,

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.400 align:middle line:84%
it just keeps breaking down,
breaking down, and releasing it

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.430 align:middle line:90%
into the body.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.230 align:middle line:90%
And so it is.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:90%
It's time release.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:13.150 align:middle line:84%
So you will get first
couple of hours release,

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:84%
couple of hours release,
couple of hours release,

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:84%
up until the end,
up to eight hours.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.840 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we found.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where do
most people put these?

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Where do they go?

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Again,
and a great question,

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.110 align:middle line:84%
only because of the fact
that a lot of people think,

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.130 align:middle line:84%
oh my gosh, you've got to put
it right at the pain center

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.980 align:middle line:84%
at the nape of the
neck, or the back--

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.550 align:middle line:84%
the backward-- that's
where my pain is focused.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.350 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:37.990 align:middle line:90%
You want to put it where--

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.142 align:middle line:84%
the most absorb area
that we've found.

00:15:40.142 --> 00:15:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's the
most absorbent area?

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: People
like-- well, we've

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.170 align:middle line:84%
liked the back of the shoulder,
the arm, the back of the arm.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Even the tummy is a good
place for maximum absorption

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.257 align:middle line:90%
for a patch.

00:15:52.257 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Unless you're hirsute.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Yeah [LAUGHS].

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So for guys,
maybe find somewhere else.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: You need to
have-- this is very critical.

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:04.450 align:middle line:84%
You really want to put it on
a hairless, lotion-free area

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.975 align:middle line:84%
for maximum efficiency
of the product for sure.

00:16:06.975 --> 00:16:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that makes sense.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.670 align:middle line:84%
If you just slathered
lotion all over--

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:10.705 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Well,
you're blocking.

00:16:10.705 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --you're blocking.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Yes.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.180 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
basically another thing

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.880 align:middle line:84%
I was interested in is
this, because a lot of times

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.730 align:middle line:84%
you take nutrients that
actually are having conflicts

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and contraindications with other
nutrients, or even some drugs,

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.620 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.120 align:middle line:84%
If you're taking
it this way, and it

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.340 align:middle line:84%
bypasses the
digestive system, do

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:90%
you still have that kind of--

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.840 align:middle line:84%
those contraindications
or cross reactivity?

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Great question.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:36.040 align:middle line:90%
Great question.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:36.880 align:middle line:90%
And no, you don't.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's the exciting
thing, again, about a patch--

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.715 align:middle line:84%
is that by passing the digestive
system and all of that--

00:16:44.715 --> 00:16:46.090 align:middle line:84%
for instance,
you're not supposed

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.150 align:middle line:84%
to take vitamin D3
with an iron patch.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.320 align:middle line:90%
It interferes.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, with our product
you can use both.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:90%
Put both patches--

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why, though?

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:53.980 align:middle line:90%
If it--

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Because you're going
directly into the bloodstream,

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.355 align:middle line:84%
and it's not interfering
with the digestive process,

00:16:59.355 --> 00:17:00.760 align:middle line:90%
and the liver, and all of that.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
digestive process

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.910 align:middle line:84%
is where these things end up
interfering with each other?

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Yes,
that's exactly right.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:06.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not the blood?

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:07.732 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: And
that's exactly right.

00:17:07.732 --> 00:17:08.859 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, why do
people have to take vitamins

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.312 align:middle line:90%
with food in the morning?

00:17:14.312 --> 00:17:16.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, here's a big
problem that I've always

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.460 align:middle line:84%
had with supplementation in
pills, powders, sublinguals.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's, I think,
why I had a problem with B12,

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.729 align:middle line:84%
because I'd always get
sick to my stomach.

00:17:21.729 --> 00:17:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Well, that, and
your omegas, and your fatty--

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, all of it.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:25.569 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: --all
of the fish oils,

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and you're burping it back
up, and it's just terrible.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: All of that goes
away with putting it on--

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
using it as a patch, going
into the bloodstream.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:84%
That's the key, and there
is no cross reactivity.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.380 align:middle line:90%
We found that.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:84%
We know that's a fact, and
that's what's great about this.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And you can, again, put
different ingredients

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.780 align:middle line:84%
that would cause
that cross reactivity

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.060 align:middle line:84%
in a pill on the
same patch, which

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:54.760 align:middle line:84%
is really exciting for
the turmeric, for the D3.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those things are
just absolutely critical.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And omega krill oil, which is
the best part of the omega-3

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:90%
that you want.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: You can put
that on one patch, where

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.720 align:middle line:84%
you weren't able to do that
by taking pills of those three

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.520 align:middle line:90%
products.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.853 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and I think
most of us who take vitamins

00:18:11.853 --> 00:18:13.865 align:middle line:84%
and minerals have always
heard that, if you

00:18:13.865 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:84%
take vitamin C, for
example, most of it

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:16.937 align:middle line:90%
just spills out in your urine.

00:18:16.937 --> 00:18:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And we know what
happens to your urine

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle line:90%
when you take your B complex.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: We do.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is that
making it all yellow,

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.220 align:middle line:90%
and dark gold, and everything?

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Well,
again, it's just--

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's just spilling.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: It's
the-- it's the pill.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.087 align:middle line:90%
It's the capsule.

00:18:29.087 --> 00:18:29.920 align:middle line:90%
That's what happens.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you're just--

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: And you're not--
it's not being absorbed.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:34.660 align:middle line:90%
It's waste.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.690 align:middle line:84%
It's all waste, and it's being
filtered out through your body,

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and that's a
simple, simple fact.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Again, you might
get 20% of a pill,

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and if it's 300
milligrams, you might only

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.750 align:middle line:90%
get 20 milligrams of that 300.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.130 align:middle line:90%
People need to understand that.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.160 align:middle line:84%
95% of pills are
filler and binder.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.148 align:middle line:90%
A patch is not.

00:18:52.148 --> 00:18:53.440 align:middle line:90%
There's no fillers and binders.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.140 align:middle line:90%
Zero.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.287 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right-o.

00:18:57.287 --> 00:18:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things I
wanted to talk to you about

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.537 align:middle line:84%
are a couple of the
universities you've been working

00:19:01.537 --> 00:19:03.630 align:middle line:90%
with on very specific projects.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:90%
And we were talking--

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.075 align:middle line:90%
we were talking off camera--

00:19:07.075 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:84%
all of us were talking
about this-- one

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.040 align:middle line:84%
that you were so excited
about because it has to do

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.300 align:middle line:90%
with kids, and autism, ADHD.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into that
study, and that project,

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.990 align:middle line:90%
and what happened there.

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: And it
wasn't with a university.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:20.766 align:middle line:90%
It was with pediatrics.

00:19:20.766 --> 00:19:21.678 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pediatrics.

00:19:21.678 --> 00:19:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD:
Pediatric physicians.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.888 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: And they
were very, very essential

00:19:26.888 --> 00:19:28.180 align:middle line:90%
into what we were trying to do.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And they work specifically
with autistic children--

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.400 align:middle line:84%
ADHD, ADAD children
that couldn't focus.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.570 align:middle line:90%
And they had the--

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.270 align:middle line:84%
they were wild and
crazy, if you will.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.980 align:middle line:90%
And nothing to them.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.150 align:middle line:84%
However, is there anything
out there that could help?

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:50.370 align:middle line:84%
So these physicians had come to
me and said, here's our idea.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.830 align:middle line:84%
We've got this,
this, this, and this

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:57.000 align:middle line:84%
that we have found works
through supplementation,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.670 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't
work to the degree

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:03.360 align:middle line:84%
that we would like to see real
benefits and help these kids.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.912 align:middle line:90%
Can you put it on a patch?

00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And I said, just all I
need is the formulation,

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.370 align:middle line:84%
the ingredients,
and let me take it,

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.840 align:middle line:90%
and let's see what we can do.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:90%
And we did.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And we started playing
with it, and my own friends

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:20.310 align:middle line:84%
that have private schools work
and have classes with autistic,

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:23.640 align:middle line:90%
and ADD, and ADHD children--

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.040 align:middle line:84%
are using the product
to great effect.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And parents have
literally called

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:32.430 align:middle line:84%
me crying that their kid is
focused, that their kid is not

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:36.780 align:middle line:84%
antsy, running around,
being crazy in a classroom

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.820 align:middle line:84%
to where they actually
are getting things done.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're not ruining
the day's activity

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.550 align:middle line:84%
with other children, and
it's so exciting to see that.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.383 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just so
sad to think, though,

00:20:46.383 --> 00:20:48.200 align:middle line:90%
that so many kids--

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.517 align:middle line:84%
it's just a matter of
nutrient deprivation--

00:20:50.517 --> 00:20:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Exactly.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that we're labeling
as these other conditions.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, that they're kind of
stuck with these labels, too,

00:20:59.150 --> 00:20:59.990 align:middle line:90%
when, in fact--

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: I know.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --it sounds like
with a certain percentage--

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sure there
are levels of autism

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:84%
that nutrients alone are simply
not going to take care of.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.917 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Of course.

00:21:07.917 --> 00:21:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But with ADHD,
and ADD, and a certain level

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:11.970 align:middle line:90%
of autism, it makes sense.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:12.770 align:middle line:90%
What's in them?

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:16.025 align:middle line:84%
What nutrients are
creating that effect?

00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Well, you're just--
you're dealing with, again,

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:23.302 align:middle line:84%
proprietary blend that these
physicians have put in there,

00:21:23.302 --> 00:21:24.260 align:middle line:90%
and I just can't talk--

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I assume there
are some B vitamins.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.303 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: But there are.

00:21:26.303 --> 00:21:30.875 align:middle line:84%
Again, and all of the nutrients,
and everything's available.

00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:32.750 align:middle line:84%
You can look and see on
the back of the panel

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:84%
as to what's in there,
so what's good for you.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.860 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Parents were spending hundreds
and hundreds of dollars

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.960 align:middle line:84%
for the pills and
the combination

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.270 align:middle line:84%
of all these ingredients
that these doctors said

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.010 align:middle line:84%
would work for them,
these physicians--

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.810 align:middle line:90%
pediatric physicians only.

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: And when
you can take one patch,

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and put it on, and see
results, and reducing the cost

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.560 align:middle line:84%
by 70% or 80%, I mean,
are we paying it forward

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.830 align:middle line:84%
or what in helping families
keep the tight pocketbook

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:02.690 align:middle line:90%
for their kids?

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.165 align:middle line:84%
But seeing the results
and helping these kids--

00:22:05.165 --> 00:22:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's exciting.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:07.065 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: It's
really exciting.

00:22:07.065 --> 00:22:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And again, we must
remember this.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:09.650 align:middle line:90%
This is so key.

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:13.387 align:middle line:84%
Not everything is
working for everybody.

00:22:13.387 --> 00:22:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Prescription drugs,
prescription pain medication

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:17.805 align:middle line:90%
doesn't work for everybody.

00:22:17.805 --> 00:22:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
in patches, too.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Just like patches.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Just like supplementation.

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.200 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on
everybody's body.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're not a cure
all for everything,

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.547 align:middle line:84%
but at least we're an
alternative to try.

00:22:27.547 --> 00:22:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Alternative
delivery system.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.505 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: I think that-- we
are an alternative delivery

00:22:31.505 --> 00:22:33.765 align:middle line:84%
system, and people need
to understand that,

00:22:33.765 --> 00:22:35.160 align:middle line:90%
that we're out there.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And with the combination
of ingredients

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.600 align:middle line:84%
that we're able to do, instead
of taking five, or six,

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:84%
or seven pills a day, put one
patch on, and see what happens.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the key to
this whole patch technology.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
mean, I'm doing it

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.235 align:middle line:84%
because I like to
play with everything.

00:22:49.235 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:84%
That's why I have so many
half or 3/4 full bottles

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:53.610 align:middle line:90%
of vitamins.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: You and millions
and millions of other people.

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I like to play
with everything, so.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Well,
you know, people--

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:84%
one more thing I want to
talk about is the fact that

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.610 align:middle line:84%
there's 100 million--
this is a fact--

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:07.210 align:middle line:84%
100 million Americans today
that have a gut issue,

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:09.660 align:middle line:84%
whether it's celiac disease,
or Crohn's disease--

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No kidding.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: --or IBS.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.568 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Literally
all of my girlfriends

00:23:12.568 --> 00:23:14.527 align:middle line:84%
and I all have
issues with our guts.

00:23:14.527 --> 00:23:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: And they
can't take pills,

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and they can't take
powders and liquids.

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.587 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I was going
to say, god, can you fix that?

00:23:19.587 --> 00:23:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Yes, and, again,
we're an alternative to that.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you were
working with UCLA and Stanford,

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.040 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: That
was many years ago.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and what
were those projects about?

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And I remember you
telling me at one point

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.220 align:middle line:84%
you had one having to do with
kids and damaged mitochondria.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.110 align:middle line:84%
We'll get into that,
too, but what were

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.282 align:middle line:90%
you working with with them?

00:23:38.282 --> 00:23:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: That's
what I was working on.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:43.470 align:middle line:84%
They'd come to me talking
about mitochondrial disease,

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:45.600 align:middle line:90%
and I went to a seminar at UCLA.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And I met with
physicians that were

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.027 align:middle line:84%
just specific to
mitochondrial disease.

00:23:52.027 --> 00:23:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking
for ways to help

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.690 align:middle line:90%
through supplementation.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.900 align:middle line:84%
They found that mass
quantities of CoQ10

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.860 align:middle line:84%
absolutely helped
children and anybody

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.530 align:middle line:90%
with mitochondrial disease.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And so they came to me
and said, listen, Dennis,

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.730 align:middle line:90%
here's what we'd like to see.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.182 align:middle line:84%
Can you take mass
quantities of CoQ10--

00:24:12.182 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:84%
we know it's the most expensive
ingredient out there today.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's
really expensive.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.142 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: But
parents are out there

00:24:17.142 --> 00:24:21.180 align:middle line:84%
spending $1,200,
$1,800 a month to just

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.490 align:middle line:84%
have enough of those
supplement pills

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.107 align:middle line:84%
to help their children
get out of bed.

00:24:25.107 --> 00:24:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Jeez, how much--

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you'd have to
take handfuls of it.

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: You'd have to take--

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.260 align:middle line:84%
they're taking up
to 20 pills a day.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.802 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they have IVs or
anything where they could do--

00:24:32.802 --> 00:24:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: You
can do three ways

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:39.180 align:middle line:84%
to get things into the body
efficiently is an infusion, IV,

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.060 align:middle line:90%
injection, or topical patch.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, besides oral.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:43.685 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:43.685 --> 00:24:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Yes.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:44.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, no.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm not-- no, oral--

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, getting it
under the skin into the body.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Yes.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:49.960 align:middle line:90%
So we said, let's try.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: So we took a study
with UCLA physicians again,

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.060 align:middle line:90%
and came up--

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.490 align:middle line:84%
for this group, this
particular group of

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.860 align:middle line:84%
mitochondrial
patients and families,

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and came up with a high
dose patch for CoQ10.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.520 align:middle line:90%
And all of a sudden, it worked.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And we were putting
2,500 milligrams--

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:14.820 align:middle line:84%
getting the kids 2,500
milligrams of CoQ10.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And kids were
getting out of bed.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:17.760 align:middle line:90%
They were functioning.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.270 align:middle line:84%
But it took going
to these seminars.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:24.110 align:middle line:84%
It took these physicians to come
to us and say, can you do this?

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Can you do that?

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:25.906 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To be
open minded enough.

00:25:25.906 --> 00:25:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: To be
open minded enough.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just pleased
to hear there are some open

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.440 align:middle line:90%
minded--

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: And it's exciting.

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --physicians in this
area of nutrients in general.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:34.080 align:middle line:84%
That's exciting to
me, because it's

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.970 align:middle line:84%
been such an uphill
battle for people

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:37.290 align:middle line:90%
who have been health conscious.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:39.540 align:middle line:84%
But let me go back to
mitochondria, because you

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.630 align:middle line:90%
were dealing with kids.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Right.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there
are-- we're learning now

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.490 align:middle line:84%
that there are more and
more elements of life that

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:49.020 align:middle line:90%
are damaging mitochondria.

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Right.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so adults
are vulnerable, as well.

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:54.390 align:middle line:90%
We're all vulnerable now.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
factors that are damaging

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.690 align:middle line:90%
our mitochondria right now?

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:01.680 align:middle line:90%
And to what effect?

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how does
this affect a person?

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Well,
again, that's not

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:05.670 align:middle line:84%
my bailiwick of getting
into that science of it.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I know it's not.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not asking you to
be a doctor on this.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Just from what you even
learned at that time.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Well, just the
fact that the red cell--

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:18.240 align:middle line:84%
the red blood cells just
weren't plentiful enough.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.630 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have the
energy to help the lungs,

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:23.130 align:middle line:84%
to help the liver
function, to help

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:25.470 align:middle line:84%
all of the functioning
of the body itself.

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And we found that, through
real clinical studies of CoQ10,

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.913 align:middle line:90%
as it was, worked.

00:26:30.913 --> 00:26:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And that was the only
thing that worked.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.955 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
I first started

00:26:33.955 --> 00:26:37.630 align:middle line:84%
using CoQ10 reading some books
and also a couple of studies

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:38.430 align:middle line:90%
out of Japan.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Back in the 19--

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.050 align:middle line:84%
late '80s or early
'90s, I think,

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and also I had read at that time
the US military was originally

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:52.120 align:middle line:84%
experimenting with it on
soldiers who were overseas

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.300 align:middle line:84%
and had a lot of gum
disease, a lot of issues with

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.560 align:middle line:84%
their mouths, obviously, and
that they were having this

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:03.270 align:middle line:84%
incredible effect on healing
gum tissue in humans--

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:04.230 align:middle line:90%
in young men.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Not just older people,
but in young men.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the Japanese use of it--

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.900 align:middle line:84%
they've been using
it for decades

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.788 align:middle line:90%
for repairing heart damage.

00:27:11.788 --> 00:27:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Right, right.

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
mitochondrial damage--

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Exactly.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.852 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and the
pulmonary system.

00:27:15.852 --> 00:27:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Exactly.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, cardiac
pulmonary system.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So I've been a big fan of
CoQ10 for many, many years.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:27.220 align:middle line:84%
But whether or not it's working
on my body, how do you know?

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do you know?

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.510 align:middle line:90%
It's mitochondria.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Other than just being
knocked out and exhausted

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.340 align:middle line:84%
if you're so damaged, then how
would the average person even

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.750 align:middle line:90%
know if they needed Q10.

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Well, again,
are you lethargic?

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:39.318 align:middle line:90%
Are you down?

00:27:39.318 --> 00:27:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bleeding gums, maybe.

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Well,
you know, all--

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:45.830 align:middle line:84%
there's so many things
that are red flags.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And again, supplementation
by using mass quantities

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.800 align:middle line:90%
that they found with CoQ10--

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.180 align:middle line:84%
you've seen things
be eliminated.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So just by process
of elimination,

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:01.850 align:middle line:84%
by trying an alternative, we are
taking those ingredients that

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:04.850 align:middle line:84%
are beneficial to certain
aspects of ailment

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.770 align:middle line:90%
and putting them on one patch.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
going back to again now.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:13.670 align:middle line:84%
We're revisiting some of the
things that we did 15 years ago

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and finding that we need
to readdress those things.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.360 align:middle line:90%
What goes around comes around.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: And society
today and the problems

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.410 align:middle line:84%
that we're having
today with health,

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:26.240 align:middle line:84%
we need to get back
in and help people.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.310 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're all about.

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:30.993 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like epidemic vitamin
D3 deficiency, for example.

00:28:30.993 --> 00:28:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Of course.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:32.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of one-- just one.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Of
course, of course.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But also all the heart
disease because of the stress.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Of course.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because of
literally the stress

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:42.950 align:middle line:84%
that has been put on
society is creating en masse

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:44.745 align:middle line:90%
cardiac issues in people.

00:28:44.745 --> 00:28:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: I was just at Hoag
Hospital in Newport Beach,

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.020 align:middle line:84%
where I have a
lot of colleagues.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking to a real good
friend of mine, a cardiologist.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.030 align:middle line:84%
He was telling me that, with
this epidemic right now,

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:57.730 align:middle line:84%
people aren't coming
in to see him.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're having
myocardial infraction--

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.768 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: You know,
infarction at home.

00:29:01.768 --> 00:29:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And he says it just breaks
his heart what's going on.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Now you've got heart disease.

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:07.430 align:middle line:84%
They come in, and
they do a repair.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:11.070 align:middle line:90%
They do a bypass or whatever.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.620 align:middle line:90%
And what do you do?

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could have
prevented that if people

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.860 align:middle line:84%
would talk about these
heart problems and issues.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's build it up and make
sure that you have something

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.040 align:middle line:90%
to help with heart disease.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's a
whole lifestyle thing, too.

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: It is.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Of course it is.

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because stress, and
anxiety, and worry is just

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.670 align:middle line:84%
going to take you
down the wrong place.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Smoking
and drinking.

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Smoking and drinking--

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to
relieve the stress,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.050 align:middle line:84%
and now you're even
further away from your--

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Right, right.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.988 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, your
good health profile.

00:29:35.988 --> 00:29:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: But let's talk
just a moment about CBD,

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.460 align:middle line:90%
because CBD works.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.736 align:middle line:84%
The trials have
shown CBD works--

00:29:43.736 --> 00:29:44.840 align:middle line:90%
works for anxiety.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.400 align:middle line:84%
It works as an
anti-inflammatory.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.155 align:middle line:90%
It helps with so many things.

00:29:49.155 --> 00:29:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Or let me rephrase that.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:52.070 align:middle line:90%
It may help with this.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.180 align:middle line:90%
It may help with that.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.290 align:middle line:90%
It may, may, may.

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:55.240 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.165 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We are
not giving advice.

00:29:56.165 --> 00:29:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: We're
not giving advice.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.465 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're making
recommendations.

00:29:58.465 --> 00:29:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: That's
exactly right.

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:03.200 align:middle line:84%
But what we have found is that
our particular patches, again,

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.230 align:middle line:84%
with CBD in them,
combination with the omegas,

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:09.980 align:middle line:84%
or with pain patches, or with
any other patch we can put CBD

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.220 align:middle line:84%
in to help relieve that
anxiety that everybody's

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.810 align:middle line:90%
expressing today.

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's freaked out.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.640 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.600 align:middle line:90%
They're out there.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.320 align:middle line:84%
They're locked in their houses,
or they're afraid to go out,

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's just created this
society today where the anxiety

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:27.630 align:middle line:90%
levels are off the chart.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Combination of a CBD
patch with calming effect

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.550 align:middle line:84%
of supplementation works, and
people are finding that now.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And we are seeing
more, and more,

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.820 align:middle line:90%
and more people get involved.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.440 align:middle line:90%
No THC in our product at all.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.030 align:middle line:90%
Not-- no THC.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:44.720 align:middle line:90%
100% CBD broad spectrum.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.650 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:47.060 align:middle line:90%
So there's no issues.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:51.960 align:middle line:84%
There's no psychotropic product
out there on a patch from us.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And the good news is that
the effects are fantastic.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:58.220 align:middle line:84%
That calming effect that
you're getting with anxiety

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.110 align:middle line:90%
is amazing.

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:04.010 align:middle line:84%
PTSD and some of these
other issues with our heroes

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:06.050 align:middle line:84%
out there that are
coming back, that

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:08.510 align:middle line:84%
have all these issues-- you
talk about anxiety and PTSD.

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:09.110 align:middle line:90%
We're finding--

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the
medical profession.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.302 align:middle line:84%
They're the frontline
heroes these days.

00:31:12.302 --> 00:31:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Exactly
with that, too.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.640 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.360 align:middle line:84%
They have PTSD coming
back from spending 10, 12,

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.360 align:middle line:90%
14 days in the ER.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.530 align:middle line:90%
That's a real deal.

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:24.650 align:middle line:84%
I know that from a
lot of my colleagues.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:26.630 align:middle line:84%
A lot of friends
out there have that,

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:29.030 align:middle line:84%
and they're using the
patch to great effect.

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:31.340 align:middle line:84%
They're having that calmness
come back to them again

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.770 align:middle line:84%
so they can be
better at treatment.

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:34.595 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:31:34.595 --> 00:31:37.095 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because so many
people-- you know, it's odd.

00:31:37.095 --> 00:31:39.930 align:middle line:84%
When you get out of a
mode and a way of being,

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:43.550 align:middle line:84%
so many people are holed
up now by themselves,

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:45.410 align:middle line:84%
afraid to be around
other people.

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And that, in itself, is
becoming an accepted way of life

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.545 align:middle line:90%
and almost a chronic mindset--

00:31:51.545 --> 00:31:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: It is terrible.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:55.003 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --where people are
now afraid of other people.

00:31:55.003 --> 00:31:55.803 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: I know.

00:31:55.803 --> 00:31:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, the psychological
effect of what's happened

00:31:57.890 --> 00:31:59.625 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely amazing.

00:31:59.625 --> 00:32:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my gosh.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: It's terrible.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in that case,
yeah, I mean, we're looking at--

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:08.120 align:middle line:84%
yeah, we have some of
the classic nutrients

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.490 align:middle line:84%
to help get your nervous
system and your brain

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:13.240 align:middle line:84%
booted up again and
all that, but that's

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.400 align:middle line:84%
a really tough one,
because it involves

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.900 align:middle line:84%
so many aspects of our
multidimensional being,

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:18.700 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.075 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Of
course, of course.

00:32:20.075 --> 00:32:23.810 align:middle line:84%
But to have a non-psychotropic
product like CBD, and again--

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot of
people are using it for--

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.420 align:middle line:84%
to good effect all
over the world.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Well,
of course, they are,

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.500 align:middle line:90%
and it's accepted today.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And people have finally
realized that it's OK.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Even physicians
now are saying, oh my gosh,

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:34.960 align:middle line:90%
CBD works.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.090 align:middle line:84%
It absolutely works for
anxiety, and it works

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:38.920 align:middle line:90%
for anti-inflammatory issues.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.985 align:middle line:90%
And so we're seeing a huge--

00:32:40.985 --> 00:32:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For sleep apparently
for a lot of people.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Sleep-- oh my
goodness gracious, you know,

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:45.430 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:48.100 align:middle line:84%
If you're not-- if you're not
sleeping, what's the problem?

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've got
some real issues.

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Functioning during the day, if
you're in a high level stress

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.400 align:middle line:84%
situation job, how
do you-- how do

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.920 align:middle line:84%
you do that if you're not
getting your six, seven, eight

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.855 align:middle line:90%
hours a day?

00:32:57.855 --> 00:32:58.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what--

00:32:58.450 --> 00:32:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
because, I mean, I

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.690 align:middle line:84%
was ignorant as to the
existence of the technology,

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:02.583 align:middle line:90%
except for nicotine.

00:33:02.583 --> 00:33:04.750 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even-- I mean, I
probably should have known

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.548 align:middle line:84%
about hormone
patches, but I didn't.

00:33:06.548 --> 00:33:07.840 align:middle line:90%
I'd never been exposed to them.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.050 align:middle line:84%
So if I didn't know about it,
and I'm out there researching

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:14.470 align:middle line:84%
a lot, then most people probably
haven't been exposed to it.

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is the joy
of my job-- is always

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.010 align:middle line:84%
being out kind of
on the forefront,

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:19.400 align:middle line:84%
discovering things, and
sharing it with people.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: I can't thank
you enough, because--

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: --people's
eyes and ears are on this.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Once I finally met
you and talked to you about all

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:27.940 align:middle line:84%
this, it was so exciting--
is that you're an Energizer

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.530 align:middle line:90%
bunny, obviously.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And you love what you do,
and I know you do a lot of--

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.130 align:middle line:84%
you do some-- a lot
of pro bono just,

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.710 align:middle line:84%
you know, good work
for society and trying

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:41.300 align:middle line:84%
to help people, disadvantaged
groups, and so forth.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.360 align:middle line:84%
But what I like is
your open mindedness

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and that you're
willing to always--

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:47.530 align:middle line:84%
if someone-- one of
these people from--

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:49.990 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a group of
pediatricians, or university,

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:52.870 align:middle line:84%
or health ministry calls
and say we've got a problem,

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact that you're
willing to play with this,

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and keep experimenting,
and putting--

00:33:57.970 --> 00:33:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Absolutely.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:33:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --putting
yourself on the line

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.400 align:middle line:90%
to find something better.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.255 align:middle line:90%
I love that mindset.

00:34:01.255 --> 00:34:01.980 align:middle line:90%
I just have to say that.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Well, I
truly appreciate that,

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:05.180 align:middle line:90%
because that is my passion.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.670 align:middle line:90%
I have a lot of passion.

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:09.489 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, it comes
out in our conversation.

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And I know I can be
a little overbearing.

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.280 align:middle line:90%
No, I love it.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: But it's needed.

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:14.620 align:middle line:90%
We need to get the story out.

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.537 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm excited.

00:34:15.537 --> 00:34:17.949 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: We need-- you
know, the naturopaths,

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:23.050 align:middle line:84%
the homeopathic,
and the holistic

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:25.449 align:middle line:84%
understand Western
medicine isn't

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:27.439 align:middle line:90%
the win-win for everybody.

00:34:27.439 --> 00:34:28.239 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:30.281 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: And there are
alternatives out there.

00:34:30.281 --> 00:34:32.679 align:middle line:84%
And this is a strong message
to send to them right now--

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:34.780 align:middle line:84%
that it's here, and
we're here to help,

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.190 align:middle line:90%
and we'll work with those--

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:38.020 align:middle line:84%
and we'll work with
those that have ideas

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.480 align:middle line:90%
and think outside the box.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.280 align:middle line:90%
Come to me.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.165 align:middle line:90%
I can make a patch.

00:34:41.165 --> 00:34:43.540 align:middle line:84%
If you give me the ingredient,
I'll take it into the lab.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what we do.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.213 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:34:45.213 --> 00:34:46.360 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts on this?

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Because it sounds
to me like this

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:51.190 align:middle line:84%
is a breakthrough
technology that

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:55.150 align:middle line:84%
is starting to move us into
the future of nutrient delivery

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.230 align:middle line:90%
and absorption.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's not to say
there's anything

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.370 align:middle line:84%
wrong with my cupboard
full of supplements.

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's doing
their part in terms

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.680 align:middle line:84%
of what we know at any
given moment in history.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's always evolving.

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.980 align:middle line:84%
You're going to evolve
and learn more, too.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.680 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just happy that
this evolutionary step

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.640 align:middle line:90%
seems to be here.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: It's
here to stay, Regina.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.120 align:middle line:90%
Nanotechnology's here.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.290 align:middle line:90%
It's evolving.

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And the things that
we can do are only

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.500 align:middle line:90%
getting bigger and better.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:22.103 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: And they're working.

00:35:22.103 --> 00:35:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And people see it, and
people are coming to us

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:25.630 align:middle line:90%
and saying, thank you.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:29.200 align:middle line:84%
So if someone watching
this is affiliated

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.390 align:middle line:84%
with a group with special
needs of some kind,

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:33.640 align:middle line:84%
they can contact you and see
if you can work with them

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:34.570 align:middle line:90%
on a formulation, even?

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:35.528 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Absolutely.

00:35:35.528 --> 00:35:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And just so you know, I have--
my daughter is special needs.

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:41.290 align:middle line:84%
I have a special needs
daughter that I work with,

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and I work with all
of those groups.

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:46.780 align:middle line:84%
That is one of my
passions, and I've

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.600 align:middle line:84%
developed certain particular
products for them, especially

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:53.838 align:middle line:84%
in the CBD line, to
help reduce seizures.

00:35:53.838 --> 00:35:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, seizures.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:55.922 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: And it works.

00:35:55.922 --> 00:35:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter's a
testament to that.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:58.627 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:35:58.627 --> 00:36:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: And again,
she has collapsed veins.

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:03.050 align:middle line:90%
We can't get draws into her.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:06.290 align:middle line:84%
I've had to put a port in her
chest so I can get blood draws,

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:08.450 align:middle line:84%
and check, and do
all those things.

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:11.570 align:middle line:84%
But here's the thing, she's
on her vitamin D patch,

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and her D levels
are off the charts.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.742 align:middle line:90%
The Bs for energy, the focus.

00:36:14.742 --> 00:36:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She's doing better.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:17.658 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: She uses
all of these things,

00:36:17.658 --> 00:36:20.180 align:middle line:84%
but she gets CBD every night,
and her seizure activity

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.500 align:middle line:90%
is almost non-existent.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I've
read the studies on that.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: That is real.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:26.095 align:middle line:10%
>>SHEPHERD: So but
I do work with that,

00:36:26.095 --> 00:36:27.680 align:middle line:10%
and again, like
the mitochondrial,

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.030 align:middle line:10%
the focus for the autistic.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:30.830 align:middle line:10%
Come to me.

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:33.530 align:middle line:10%
If you have issues, you
have a problem, come to me,

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:35.550 align:middle line:10%
and we'll try and
see if we can help.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I like that you're not
too big for your britches where

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.000 align:middle line:90%
no one can--

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEPHERD: Not--
nobody should be.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No one can
get to you, yeah.

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: There's no ego here.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Just remember,
there's no ego here.

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.350 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Dennis,
thanks so much.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.805 align:middle line:90%
I'm really excited.

00:36:43.805 --> 00:36:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: My pleasure.

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This was great.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEPHERD: Great, Regina.

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.588 align:middle line:10%
