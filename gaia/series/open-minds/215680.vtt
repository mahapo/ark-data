00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:21.800 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: We have
someone very special with us

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.720 align:middle line:10%
today and new to Open
Minds, Lee Carroll.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.180 align:middle line:10%
It's hard to believe this is
my very first time with Lee.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm absolutely thrilled to
check in with what he has to say

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and what he's channeled
recently with Kryon,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.820 align:middle line:84%
absolutely phenomenal
information for our time.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.680 align:middle line:84%
So, so good to
have you here, Lee.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>> LEE CARROLL: This is where
I'm supposed to say it's really

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.610 align:middle line:90%
good also, and I'm--

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.940 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] I'm saying that--

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thank you for
saying what you have to say.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.703 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: No, it's
way, way overdue.

00:00:46.703 --> 00:00:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
it's way overdue.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.520 align:middle line:84%
I literally can't believe
we haven't met until now.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.423 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: This
is the Gaia family.

00:00:52.423 --> 00:00:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: And it's beautiful.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.900 align:middle line:84%
We have a very lovely
group of people here.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:84%
So because you do so
many things and I--

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.960 align:middle line:84%
if I'm on YouTube
looking, usually

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.610 align:middle line:84%
for little kitties and puppies
and things that make me laugh,

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.410 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.925 align:middle line:90%
But you pop up a fair amount.

00:01:08.925 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And you're sweet and cuddly and
make me laugh too sometimes.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.137 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, recently, a few
of your commentaries of your--

00:01:16.137 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
call them commentaries--

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:90%
presentations have popped up.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was
I just wrote down

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.930 align:middle line:84%
some notes from
a couple of them,

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.810 align:middle line:84%
plus some other
questions at large

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.840 align:middle line:84%
because we have so much
going on in these times.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that
you really talk about

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:84%
is that you've known about,
and were told many years ago,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.910 align:middle line:84%
about this time in history,
that this time had to come,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and that these were
going to be dark times

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
but leading to the light,
because the light wins

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.850 align:middle line:90%
in the end.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.090 align:middle line:84%
First of all, all right,
that's the spoiler alert.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:90%
Light wins.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.820 align:middle line:90%
We all know that.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.520 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, we're trying
to navigate these other times.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.285 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
you were told back when.

00:01:57.285 --> 00:01:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: I will
tell you that.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.780 align:middle line:90%
Also I'd like to reframe.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.580 align:middle line:90%
Light will win.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.420 align:middle line:90%
Light is winning.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.290 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Light is winning.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:10%
>> CARROLL: It is winning.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.810 align:middle line:10%
So we're there.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.770 align:middle line:10%
I was told many years ago.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.510 align:middle line:10%
Well, I've been doing
this for 36 years.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:10%
I'm a spiritual channel.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:16.000 align:middle line:10%
I was told many, many times
about what was coming right now.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.350 align:middle line:10%
And part of, I would say,
the channeling experience

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.080 align:middle line:10%
for all those years
also had to do

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.280 align:middle line:10%
with me studying what the
indigenous of the planet

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.580 align:middle line:10%
also said so that we
weren't facing something

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.260 align:middle line:10%
that people will say, this is
going to be a new age thing,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.310 align:middle line:10%
you've made it up--

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: No.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: --and all of that.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And much to my
delight, everywhere I

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.910 align:middle line:84%
looked in the cosmology
of the Incas, in the Maya,

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.630 align:middle line:84%
there's the Hopi, they talked
about this time in history,

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and so did my church,
because this is scriptural.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.960 align:middle line:84%
On or about the years
2000 and beyond,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.810 align:middle line:84%
something was going to happen,
whether it was the Armageddon

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.350 align:middle line:90%
or whether it was the rapture.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.880 align:middle line:84%
That's me training
in Sunday school.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: But also,
it's everywhere.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And then we started meeting the
indigenous who then pegged it.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.130 align:middle line:90%
This is what's going to happen.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.560 align:middle line:84%
We are sitting right smack
in what was predicted.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right
at that crossover.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.202 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: That's right.

00:03:17.202 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, Kryon's first book
was called The End Times,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.670 align:middle line:84%
and that was a
frightening title.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.710 align:middle line:84%
But the title meant it's
the end of an old time.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.130 align:middle line:90%
The old energy is passing away.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And in that, there
are a whole lot

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
of those with low
consciousness who

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.780 align:middle line:84%
want it to stay because
they're having good lives.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:90%
They're making a lot of money.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.230 align:middle line:90%
They don't want change.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And so there is
a fight going on.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.520 align:middle line:90%
And it isn't dark and light.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:90%
It's not evil and good.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.620 align:middle line:84%
It is dark, I would say,
old and new consciousness.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think that's a
perfectly fair way to put it.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a dying consciousness.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: It is a
dying consciousness.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.252 align:middle line:84%
Even right now,
light is winning.

00:03:59.252 --> 00:04:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask me, I'll tell you
some of the things we don't even

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.050 align:middle line:84%
think of that have happened
in the last years that

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.515 align:middle line:90%
show this very, very clearly.

00:04:06.515 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Give us an idea.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.960 align:middle line:90%
Just give us examples.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: If you ask your
grandfather or his grandfather

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
if there will ever be a
time when women wouldn't be

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:84%
subjugated to the whims of men
to get ahead and have to do

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.190 align:middle line:84%
certain kinds of things,
today, you have actors,

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:84%
you have congressmen, you
have rich guys going to jail

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:90%
for the very things like that.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather would have said,
it has been with us forever.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.090 align:middle line:90%
It always will be.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.260 align:middle line:90%
This is the way it is.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And that basically has been
the story up until now.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.210 align:middle line:84%
That's just the way it is on
earth, and I never bought it.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.252 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I didn't buy
most of what they told me

00:04:45.252 --> 00:04:46.500 align:middle line:90%
in Sunday school either.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: In Texas years
ago, Kryon gave a channel.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.760 align:middle line:84%
He said, we're going to
have a new pope soon.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.080 align:middle line:84%
13 months later,
we had a new pope,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.560 align:middle line:90%
and the other one didn't die.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.227 align:middle line:90%
Now he was reading the field.

00:04:57.227 --> 00:04:58.560 align:middle line:90%
That's Lynne McTaggart, one of--

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.477 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:59.477 --> 00:05:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: And so
this was something.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, the new pope
came along and did,

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.360 align:middle line:84%
what, something else that we
were told would never happen.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.390 align:middle line:84%
The new pope said, we
have priests abusing kids.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to stop it.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.170 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
do something about it.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.150 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to be
shoved around anymore.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:84%
I thought that
would never happen.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.990 align:middle line:90%
There's too much money there.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.340 align:middle line:90%
There's too much power there.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:90%
And it happened.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.130 align:middle line:90%
These are the kinds of things.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And then there is some obvious
little consciousness changes,

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.840 align:middle line:90%
call them little.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Can I just give you
a little example?

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You go for it.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.307 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: All right.

00:05:31.307 --> 00:05:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Put yourself 200, 250 years ago.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.580 align:middle line:90%
That's not that long in time.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Average age these days,
we've got maybe 60, 70 years.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.570 align:middle line:84%
That's only a few
generations back.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.070 align:middle line:90%
So pretend you're there.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.550 align:middle line:84%
You're a mom, and you're about
to take your kids for a picnic.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're going to pack
the food and all like that.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:50.820 align:middle line:90%
Kids are with you.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Going to go to a
little grassy place

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.540 align:middle line:84%
where you're going
to sit down, you're

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.110 align:middle line:84%
going to have a
good time, and you

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.490 align:middle line:90%
are going to watch a beheading.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.680 align:middle line:84%
That's exact same-- that is
the exact same example I use.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.495 align:middle line:84%
Or even only 100, even 60 years
ago, even in the United States,

00:06:07.495 --> 00:06:09.120 align:middle line:84%
watch a lynching on
a Saturday morning.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: Watch a lynching
on a Saturday morning.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we think we
haven't grown in consciousness?

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: We have.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: It's slow.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: But it is an
example, over and over.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Light is winning.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.030 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody's getting it.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about, are you
going to be getting religion?

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to get some
doctrine shoved at you?

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a natural awakening
to a bigger truth.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree, totally.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And it seems there are lines
that are lines of demarcation

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.755 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: Yes, there are.

00:06:40.755 --> 00:06:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And there is
self-responsibility involved.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's tough
because now we have

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.640 align:middle line:84%
to get down-- like you said,
no, it's always been that way.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
That's what's been said
historically on earth.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is now we have
to start refining that story.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:01.410 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me one of them is,
it's not really great anymore

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.790 align:middle line:84%
to gain at the
expense of another.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: No, it isn't.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That story
no longer works,

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.280 align:middle line:84%
and we've all accepted
it up until recently.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: Those kinds of
stories now slap me in the face.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.462 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I
was younger, there

00:07:15.462 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:84%
are kinds of stories
that are acceptable.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.760 align:middle line:84%
There are kinds of things
that are acceptable.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm with a
group of people who

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.080 align:middle line:84%
start either
complaining or talking

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.910 align:middle line:84%
or whatever or hate
rhetoric and all.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.550 align:middle line:90%
You just want to leave the room.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.090 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer anything
that I want to hear.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.590 align:middle line:90%
It makes me sad inside.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, me too, very.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: Yeah.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.355 align:middle line:84%
By the way, we can
all get through that.

00:07:38.355 --> 00:07:40.155 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] There are ways.

00:07:40.155 --> 00:07:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In fact, let's
talk about that right now

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:84%
because in one of your videos,
you were speaking about it.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.200 align:middle line:84%
But something that I
found interesting--

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.910 align:middle line:84%
we were chatting off camera,
and I said, this whole notion

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.920 align:middle line:84%
of this division
among people now,

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.390 align:middle line:90%
the polarization among people.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And you were saying that
the mastery comes when you

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:06.410 align:middle line:84%
don't allow yourself to
go there, when you don't--

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.550 align:middle line:84%
So let's open that discussion
up a little bit because we

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.120 align:middle line:90%
are feeling creatures.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: Let's
start at the beginning.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's go to the
beginning because we have

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.850 align:middle line:90%
so much subconscious stuff.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: We do.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.360 align:middle line:84%
We're programmed from birth in
our society, in our culture.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.095 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no
conspiracy to programming

00:08:23.095 --> 00:08:24.610 align:middle line:90%
to that, just our culture.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's a culture
based in a dark energy,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.220 align:middle line:90%
and that's the way it is.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.160 align:middle line:84%
So what we teach
and what's happening

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and what all of
the Indigenous said

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.940 align:middle line:84%
and what Kryon told me
all those years ago,

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be
a time of awakening.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And the awakening is
naturally going to happen.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.520 align:middle line:84%
But it has some metaphors that
I'll tell you later about, what

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:90%
we're actually doing.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:84%
But in this awakening,
we are going

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.440 align:middle line:84%
to start seeing and studying
what the Masters knew.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.070 align:middle line:84%
My whole point of what I
teach is studying mastery.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.150 align:middle line:84%
When you've got
several attributes,

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.870 align:middle line:84%
the first, most important
one regarding the division

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing in consciousness
right now, the polarization,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:90%
is mastery observes.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.180 align:middle line:90%
It does not react.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And so let's go a
little deeper into that.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.810 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely right.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So you have, say, certain
rhetoric going on.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And people who have
suffered at the hands

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.560 align:middle line:84%
of that kind of rhetoric,
maybe 300 or 400 years ago

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.365 align:middle line:84%
in past lives, it's buried in
the body, in the subconscious.

00:09:27.365 --> 00:09:28.165 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: It is.

00:09:28.165 --> 00:09:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're
responding with anger or fear

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.420 align:middle line:90%
and don't even understand why.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:84%
So this is an interesting part
to say, yeah, I do feel this.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.340 align:middle line:84%
How can you not
respond if your body's

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.440 align:middle line:84%
responding from an old
subconscious memory or pattern,

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.730 align:middle line:90%
which is interesting.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: I tell people,
this is how you have to train

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.315 align:middle line:84%
yourself to go inside,
drop into your heart,

00:09:51.315 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and find that which is the
divine peace that we all have.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.930 align:middle line:84%
The metaphor that Kryon
has given over and over,

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and we can even talk about
that, there is a lifting veil.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.580 align:middle line:90%
Now I do spiritual work.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: I don't channel
ETs or things of this.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.120 align:middle line:90%
I do spiritual work.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.150 align:middle line:84%
We have what is called
a lifting of the veil.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.590 align:middle line:84%
The veil has always blocked us
from the angelic power and all

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:13.390 align:middle line:90%
of these things.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Kryon says, you were
born magnificent.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.780 align:middle line:84%
You were not born
dirty as you were

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:90%
told, perhaps by your church.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.000 align:middle line:90%
You're born magnificent.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like the block of stone
that the sculptor takes,

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and he knows what
to remove in order

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.505 align:middle line:90%
to create the Michelangelo.

00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:35.290 align:middle line:84%
We are now peeling that
onion and starting to remove,

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:39.465 align:middle line:84%
and this is the important
part, what was always there.

00:10:39.465 --> 00:10:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that veil had
to really be there till we were

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:90%
ready to start waking up, right?

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: The
veil is inside us.

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's
always been there, right?

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: Yes.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Until we
were ready to wake up.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: So that awakening
we're talking about is

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.080 align:middle line:84%
a transformation
of consciousness.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is what Kryon
has always been about.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.920 align:middle line:90%
And there's physics involved.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.610 align:middle line:84%
There's all manner of things
to bring us to this point

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.100 align:middle line:84%
where we can begin to
then carve that statue.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.380 align:middle line:84%
We have been in a
circle of old energy.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.790 align:middle line:90%
History repeats itself.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.927 align:middle line:84%
Gregg Braden's book, The Fractal
Time book, proved it, showed it.

00:11:12.927 --> 00:11:14.010 align:middle line:90%
It's even scientifically--

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:14.927 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:11:14.927 --> 00:11:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: --until now.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And we have gotten
off of the circle.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.600 align:middle line:90%
We're on a new track.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:84%
That track, by the
way, we've never

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.530 align:middle line:84%
been on before, it's scary to
almost everybody, even to me,

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:30.700 align:middle line:84%
because we've never been
on that train before.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
So here we are in a new
track with light shining,

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:90%
and we're still uncomfortable.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people
who don't want that track.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.688 align:middle line:84%
They'd just rather
be in the circle

00:11:39.688 --> 00:11:40.870 align:middle line:90%
because it's so comfortable.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.190 align:middle line:90%
It works for them.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:43.720 align:middle line:90%
That is all that they have.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:49.560 align:middle line:84%
But we are having this amazing
awakening taking place.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:90%
This is very exciting to me.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It is
exciting to me too.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:55.630 align:middle line:84%
But we do have to tiptoe through
the dog poo to get there.

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.265 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: And that's
what's going on.

00:11:58.265 --> 00:12:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So back to the study
of mastery and all.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:04.680 align:middle line:84%
When you get to this place where
you will not react internally

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.440 align:middle line:84%
because of your Akash, perhaps,
and this is very doable,

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.940 align:middle line:90%
you can really be peaceful.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.890 align:middle line:84%
You can sit and
learn to be peaceful.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you go to
India for a while

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and discover how they've
done it, and they teach it,

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.970 align:middle line:90%
and this is very doable.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.880 align:middle line:84%
But more than that, you
can disengage your buttons.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:84%
I think what you
said earlier, I have

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.710 align:middle line:90%
found to be the absolute key.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And that is, if you can take
what's going on in your head

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and what's just overwhelmed
you-- and the thing is,

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.780 align:middle line:84%
having the presence to remember
to do it in that moment.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.675 align:middle line:84%
Right now, it's really
because it's habit.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:41.750 align:middle line:84%
If we don't do it, it's just old
habit that we're buying into.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:45.920 align:middle line:84%
But to drop those very
thoughts down into the heart,

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:84%
and it totally
transforms the way

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.080 align:middle line:84%
your body starts
feeling about whatever

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.740 align:middle line:90%
it is you've been exposed to.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: And also, then
you have the outside sources,

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.730 align:middle line:90%
the family.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.488 align:middle line:84%
So let's say the family
doesn't like what you're into,

00:12:58.488 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle line:84%
thinks you're an idiot,
and you're foolish,

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and that you broke ranks
with the rest of them,

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.392 align:middle line:84%
either it's
generationally, or you

00:13:05.392 --> 00:13:07.100 align:middle line:84%
didn't do what they
thought you would do,

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.600 align:middle line:84%
or you're in the
wrong religion now,

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.330 align:middle line:90%
or you've gone off the deep end.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you go home,
and you're with them

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.230 align:middle line:84%
for Christmas or New Years
or Thanksgiving, whatever.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.935 align:middle line:90%
And now the barrage starts.

00:13:17.935 --> 00:13:20.800 align:middle line:84%
This is what I tell people,
and it's worked and worked

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.740 align:middle line:90%
and worked and worked.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is you
become a listener.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Do not react to
anything they're saying.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.045 align:middle line:90%
Listen to what they say.

00:13:28.045 --> 00:13:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to change them because
you will not change them.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.870 align:middle line:84%
You will simply make it
worse, absolutely worse.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.155 align:middle line:84%
And up to a point
where you can say--

00:13:37.155 --> 00:13:38.780 align:middle line:84%
let's say you got a
brother or a sister

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:84%
or a mother or father who's
looking at you and going,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.470 align:middle line:90%
you're going straight to hell.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm really disappointed
and all that thing.

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And you look at them,
and you say, you know?

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.355 align:middle line:84%
You know we don't agree, but
I really love you anyway.

00:13:51.355 --> 00:13:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
let you know that.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And that's great.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.020 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: A conversation--

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It
confuses everything.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: --stopper.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: Absolutely.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.833 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, I agree with you.

00:13:59.833 --> 00:14:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: You do that enough,
and they stop for a while,

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:06.380 align:middle line:84%
after a while, because you're
really talking at the love

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.370 align:middle line:90%
level, the love level.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And a mom and a dad,
especially, are going

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.540 align:middle line:90%
to get that at some point.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And they may simply walk
away and not get it.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Or they may come
back later and go,

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about what you
said, and I love you too.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.070 align:middle line:90%
This works.

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:23.880 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And you can start doing
that even at work.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.990 align:middle line:84%
You can do that to people who
are always on you politically,

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:29.790 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And you know, how can you
possibly have done this

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.595 align:middle line:90%
and not believe that?

00:14:33.595 --> 00:14:34.477 align:middle line:90%
You're an idiot.

00:14:34.477 --> 00:14:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you're also
listening to completely

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.180 align:middle line:90%
different streams of info.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's
brainwashed by media.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: Yeah.

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.367 align:middle line:84%
And so you look at--
and you look at them,

00:14:42.367 --> 00:14:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and you can just smile and
say, you know we don't agree,

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.950 align:middle line:90%
but I kind of like you anyway.

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: And this
is what we teach.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.440 align:middle line:90%
This is mastery.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, so--

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:84%
and you've talked about
this before, which

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.360 align:middle line:84%
is what I just mentioned, you're
mentioning here, the notion

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.780 align:middle line:90%
that we've all been siloed.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.050 align:middle line:84%
The media has been
very, very destructive.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a necessary
arm of the darkness

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to
fulfill those agendas

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.300 align:middle line:84%
by the people, the beings
that try to control this show.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And so we're now seeing an
explosion in independent media

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:90%
via podcasts.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And even some of the
big streaming companies

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.210 align:middle line:84%
are starting to put some
questioning and edgy material

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.530 align:middle line:84%
on, which is
absolutely fascinating.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And so we realize
that a lot of this

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.150 align:middle line:84%
is all happening
in the mind matrix,

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.333 align:middle line:84%
but it's not really part of
who we are, this division.

00:15:36.333 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: I'm looking at you,
and I'm not hearing the question

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.690 align:middle line:90%
because I have something to say.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sure.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:44.217 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: Do you have-- do you
have any idea how important you

00:15:44.217 --> 00:15:46.500 align:middle line:84%
are in this program
to this planet?

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: It's
not a compliment.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:53.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a fact, because
you are the new media.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, we are
part of the new media.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: That's
exactly right.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: Have any idea how
many people are involved in this

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:00.730 align:middle line:90%
with the Gaia--

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:02.655 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: --with of that?

00:16:02.655 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:90%
It's approaching a million.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Really?

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: Yes.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we have
always said was coming.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.950 align:middle line:84%
If I had anything to say to
everybody who's watching this,

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.700 align:middle line:84%
I would say, please understand,
don't watch the news.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.710 align:middle line:90%
Don't watch the news.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:22.570 align:middle line:90%
Get it in written form.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's exactly right.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: Get it from a
professional journalist instead

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:84%
of somebody who is dressing up
and looking nice and giving you

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.588 align:middle line:84%
entertainment and
is told what to say.

00:16:32.588 --> 00:16:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In their cocktail
dresses, by the way.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: That's correct.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I was a news anchor.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.740 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't wear
a cocktail dress,

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.198 align:middle line:84%
and you had to
actually be serious.

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:40.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: This is what is--

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.270 align:middle line:90%
be aware of it.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Just start listening
to what they're saying,

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and you'll understand that
they grabbed the worst things

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.530 align:middle line:90%
possible and put them first.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And then they
continue with that.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.590 align:middle line:84%
When we had these
fires in Los Angeles,

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and I live in San Diego, the
news, every single channel,

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:00.430 align:middle line:90%
was the same.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.670 align:middle line:84%
They put somebody in
front of a burned house

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.069 align:middle line:90%
and interview a sobbing person.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:08.141 align:middle line:84%
How is this helping anyone
in this planet right now?

00:17:08.141 --> 00:17:09.099 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, I agree.

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:10.839 align:middle line:84%
I quit doing news for
that exact reason.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:11.881 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: That's right.

00:17:11.881 --> 00:17:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And so when you start
moving away from,

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.670 align:middle line:84%
hey, maybe there's
programming going on here.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:90%
And why are they doing that?

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:20.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a conspiracy.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:90%
It is not.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.569 align:middle line:84%
It's just an old energy paradigm
to get people to tune in and buy

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:25.619 align:middle line:90%
products.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:27.682 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it's
always been about.

00:17:27.682 --> 00:17:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
fear is addictive.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.182 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: That's right.

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:32.720 align:middle line:84%
What we have here,
what you have here,

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.270 align:middle line:84%
what we are doing
together, I believe,

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:38.950 align:middle line:84%
is a paradigm that is going
to be now emulated and copied

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and is going to
hit the mainstream.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.370 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
find Netflix and all

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:45.620 align:middle line:84%
that looking for programming,
which is more gentle,

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.077 align:middle line:84%
which is a bigger
truth, you might say,

00:17:48.077 --> 00:17:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and a balanced way of
looking at the planet.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That is what I crave,
is to have a program where you

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.240 align:middle line:84%
can have people on
different sides of an issue,

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.460 align:middle line:84%
but who are intelligent, and who
have the capacity for critical

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.210 align:middle line:84%
thinking, and who have open
hearts to come together

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:07.648 align:middle line:84%
and reflect on different
views of a given topic.

00:18:07.648 --> 00:18:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So you have something really
to go away and think about

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.905 align:middle line:90%
without any divisive thinking.

00:18:11.905 --> 00:18:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: When
I was in my 40s,

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:19.840 align:middle line:84%
I remember the monthly baseball
game that the Democrats

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.360 align:middle line:90%
and Republicans would play.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: And they would
be interested in the winners.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.010 align:middle line:84%
They didn't get together and
throw dirt at each other.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I know.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.140 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: They understood that
they had a different opinion,

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:84%
but they were both patriots
and loved the country.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And they could get
together and do this.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:90%
That's gone.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is gone.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.810 align:middle line:84%
That's before whoever runs the
media show and entertainment

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.080 align:middle line:90%
show ratchet it up.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.547 align:middle line:90%
It's strong arming.

00:18:44.547 --> 00:18:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: Correct.

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.590 align:middle line:84%
So when you start
listening or even

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.080 align:middle line:84%
some things on, for instance,
the media that you might see,

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.110 align:middle line:84%
watch for the buzzwords
that are there

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.770 align:middle line:90%
that are completely biased.

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.330 align:middle line:90%
They're not reporting anything.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.458 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: They're
pushing information at you,

00:18:59.458 --> 00:19:00.650 align:middle line:90%
so you'll believe something.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:01.560 align:middle line:90%
That is an agenda.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: So this is
part of the decisiveness.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.370 align:middle line:90%
It is an old energy.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And I recognize it when
I see it, immediately,

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.273 align:middle line:84%
as soon as you start
paying attention.

00:19:13.273 --> 00:19:14.107 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:19:14.107 --> 00:19:15.600 align:middle line:84%
You can feel it
manipulating you.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.058 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: And by the way,
you don't watch 11 o'clock news

00:19:18.058 --> 00:19:19.020 align:middle line:90%
and sleep well.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:19.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:21.173 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
why I quit doing it.

00:19:21.173 --> 00:19:23.330 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm serving up
bad news before people

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:24.130 align:middle line:90%
go into dream time.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:25.172 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: That's right.

00:19:25.172 --> 00:19:26.505 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And they required it.

00:19:26.505 --> 00:19:27.547 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: That's right.

00:19:27.547 --> 00:19:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We even
tried the good news.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.630 align:middle line:90%
We used the noon news.

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.630 align:middle line:84%
They use me as an
experimental vehicle

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.010 align:middle line:84%
to see if we could do
a good news forecast.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:35.810 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: When did you do it?

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.968 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This was ages ago.

00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: I mean,
what time of day?

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.052 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That was at noon, so
it would have affected women.

00:19:42.052 --> 00:19:43.082 align:middle line:90%
It's still failed.

00:19:43.082 --> 00:19:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: It failed--

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It totally failed.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.275 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: --mostly I
think, because it's at noon,

00:19:46.275 --> 00:19:47.520 align:middle line:90%
and people are still working.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.320 align:middle line:84%
They haven't even come
home to watch the news.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.528 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, but I mean,
even so, you should have

00:19:51.528 --> 00:19:54.410 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more gentle
audience among women that are

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:57.020 align:middle line:84%
staying home or people
in that day staying home.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.020 align:middle line:90%
This is a long time ago.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:58.690 align:middle line:90%
This is in the '80s.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:19:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: Yeah.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm not surprised
it didn't work.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But I think something
like that-- and they tried.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.550 align:middle line:84%
There's the Optimists,
The Daily Optimist.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And different types
of publications

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.190 align:middle line:84%
are trying to do
this, but it hasn't

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:14.130 align:middle line:84%
gotten that strong
magnetic appeal yet.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: The answer is going
to come from the sleepers,

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and that's the young people,
what I've called the Indigos

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:84%
because I wrote the book in
1999 called The Indigo Children,

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:90%
who now are starting to emerge.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.080 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are in Congress.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:84%
They are the age now that
they can be junior senators

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.060 align:middle line:90%
and whatever.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.210 align:middle line:90%
They see it.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.880 align:middle line:10%
They see it clearly, and
it's offensive to them.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.540 align:middle line:10%
They're keeping quiet now
until they can do something.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.290 align:middle line:10%
They have to go on the
various committees.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.595 align:middle line:84%
They see how they work, and
they're going to emerge.

00:20:40.595 --> 00:20:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And when they
start, you're going

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.260 align:middle line:84%
to be amazed at
what they're saying

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.093 align:middle line:84%
because the first thing
they're going to say

00:20:45.093 --> 00:20:46.860 align:middle line:90%
is, this is my opponent.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.340 align:middle line:90%
This person is a patriot.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.500 align:middle line:90%
Look what they've done.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't agree.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.480 align:middle line:84%
I can do something better,
but I don't hate them.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:54.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And what you said earlier,
too, I think is critical.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.670 align:middle line:84%
If you want to remain
somewhat informed

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.980 align:middle line:84%
as to what's going on around
you, because it does feel--

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me, I
almost feel I have

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.910 align:middle line:84%
to be somewhat informed
just to do my work.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:07.827 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: Of course.

00:21:07.827 --> 00:21:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But I
do what you said.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Mostly I just use written word
because it's not as inflamed.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.610 align:middle line:90%
There's no nuance.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:16.900 align:middle line:90%
There are no colors.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.400 align:middle line:90%
There are no-- there's no light.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.250 align:middle line:84%
There are no flashing
headlines to manipulate you.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.710 align:middle line:90%
But it is now--

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I think it's in
everyone's best interest

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.520 align:middle line:84%
to start looking for
what they feel are truly

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.700 align:middle line:84%
balanced minds out
there who are not

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.858 align:middle line:84%
prejudicial or true journalists
because that's almost dead.

00:21:37.858 --> 00:21:38.900 align:middle line:90%
There are some out there.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: There are.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And there are
some rising and some younger

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.560 align:middle line:84%
journalists rising that
are true journalists.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I try to find them and
follow them by written word.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: I was a recording
engineer for 15 years.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things we did in
my town that I did that is we

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:90%
did commercials.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.290 align:middle line:90%
We did news, opens and closes.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.560 align:middle line:90%
We did it from NBC and ABC.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't realize that the
news on is scored with music.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: It's
scored with music.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: It is
definitely pointed at drama.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:12.863 align:middle line:84%
They want you to be
afraid with the music.

00:22:12.863 --> 00:22:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.238 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: Like,
here's the music.

00:22:15.238 --> 00:22:17.322 align:middle line:90%
[HUMMING] And it's like--

00:22:17.322 --> 00:22:18.530 align:middle line:90%
and then here comes the news.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:19.730 align:middle line:90%
That's not news.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, it already
has-- it's already fulfilled

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:23.740 align:middle line:90%
the manipulative part of it.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.330 align:middle line:84%
I used to produce, and I
produced documentaries.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And oddly, I know, at the time,
people thought I was nuts.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:84%
But I always found the musician
to do the musical score first

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.002 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted
it to set a tone.

00:22:37.002 --> 00:22:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: It sets the tone.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Whether it was
to be open, compassionate,

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:45.520 align:middle line:84%
whatever it was, I wanted the
tone set subconsciously so that

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.820 align:middle line:84%
then the words and information
could be received in the way I

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.180 align:middle line:90%
hoped they would be received.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Nonetheless, it's
a manipulation.

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: It is.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Anybody who--

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.925 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When you pair
it with information--

00:22:54.925 --> 00:22:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: Yes, studies
advertising and all of these

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.580 align:middle line:84%
things understand
all of these things.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.710 align:middle line:90%
We have to search for good news.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:04.420 align:middle line:84%
We have to search for a good
journalist, as you said.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's get to the
subject now that I love--

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:10.310 align:middle line:90%
of many.

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And that is one that
I know you do too

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and you have wonderful
things to say about.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's the
subject of free will

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.900 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot of
misunderstanding about how

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.110 align:middle line:90%
free will works, what it is.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And some people believe
we don't even have any.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.930 align:middle line:84%
A year and a half
ago, a fellow named

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Robert Sapolsky wrote a
book, Determined, essentially

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.240 align:middle line:90%
life with no free will.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.613 align:middle line:90%
And I was offended.

00:23:33.613 --> 00:23:34.617 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:23:34.617 --> 00:23:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: You should be.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.062 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about free will.

00:23:38.062 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: When you look
at scripture, for instance,

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.625 align:middle line:84%
it's the only
guideline I ever had,

00:23:42.625 --> 00:23:45.750 align:middle line:84%
it's actually missing because
you have there the idea

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.000 align:middle line:84%
of what's going to happen
and where we're going to go.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't look like
we have much choice.

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.612 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
and it's God's will.

00:23:51.612 --> 00:23:52.590 align:middle line:90%
You live by God's will.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:53.632 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: That's right.

00:23:53.632 --> 00:23:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And then you have-- even
as a metaphysical person,

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.523 align:middle line:84%
let's say you are
a new age person,

00:23:57.523 --> 00:23:59.190 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call
it that or whatever,

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:00.980 align:middle line:90%
then you have the contract.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:05.180 align:middle line:84%
So all of these kinds of things
point to an old energy paradigm

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.360 align:middle line:84%
that things are going to happen
regardless of anything you do.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's just the opposite.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.970 align:middle line:90%
It's totally the opposite.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:14.660 align:middle line:84%
My information for
30 years has been

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:84%
about the magnificent
human being that

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.430 align:middle line:84%
has high consciousness
inside, is

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:middle line:84%
going to awaken
to a new paradigm,

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.670 align:middle line:84%
a multi-dimensional universe,
where we control everything

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:28.590 align:middle line:84%
through benevolent action,
through consciousness,

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.500 align:middle line:90%
compassion, and kindness.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
free will we have.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Look at what's happening
on the planet right now.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.780 align:middle line:90%
We have free will to change it.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.430 align:middle line:84%
We are awakening
to an idea where

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.300 align:middle line:90%
we have the creator inside.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.307 align:middle line:84%
Now I know I'm getting
spiritual, but this is--

00:24:47.307 --> 00:24:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We'll that's
who you're talking--

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.870 align:middle line:90%
our audience is totally open.

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:53.645 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: You'll find this
in scripture, god inside.

00:24:53.645 --> 00:24:57.350 align:middle line:84%
If that's true and we have
that soul and that magnificence

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.760 align:middle line:84%
that we have, that free will
is something that we are not

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.210 align:middle line:90%
only born with, it's our right.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:06.290 align:middle line:84%
It's our lineage to
awaken this earth

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and make a transition that
nobody really, truly expected.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:14.450 align:middle line:84%
It was the Harmonic
Convergence in 1987

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:17.770 align:middle line:84%
that actually set
this in motion.

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was up
on Shasta meditating.

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:20.650 align:middle line:90%
I had my tent.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:21.450 align:middle line:90%
I was there.

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:22.350 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: It was almost like
the earth was asked a question.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.280 align:middle line:84%
The alignments were, well, are
we going to go ahead or not?

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to go
through an Armageddon,

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.333 align:middle line:84%
or are we going to go
through World War III?

00:25:30.333 --> 00:25:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to have
nuclear war or not?

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.207 align:middle line:84%
And the overwhelming
thing was we're

00:25:35.207 --> 00:25:37.290 align:middle line:84%
ready for the-- we're ready
to go through the poop

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:39.440 align:middle line:84%
if we have to, but
we're going to.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.127 align:middle line:90%
And this is why we came.

00:25:41.127 --> 00:25:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the souls that
I'm looking at today, no matter

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:45.990 align:middle line:84%
how old they are, including
the Indigos and all,

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:47.790 align:middle line:90%
are aware of this.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.060 align:middle line:90%
This is why we're here.

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And that takes a
free will that says

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:54.700 align:middle line:84%
we are going to make an
ascended planet happen.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to start
by teaching mastery.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.310 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start by getting
through this division where

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.560 align:middle line:84%
people are starting to hate and
complain and all these things,

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and not even realize that it's
simply what their parents did.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:10.385 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, this is not
your grandpa's world anymore.

00:26:10.385 --> 00:26:11.215 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:26:11.215 --> 00:26:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: It just is not.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's the best
answer that I can have.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.690 align:middle line:90%
We have ultimate free will.

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:19.400 align:middle line:90%
It is not restricted.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.230 align:middle line:90%
We can do whatever we want to.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.850 align:middle line:84%
We can even change our
future before we get there.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So then the
issue becomes we all have

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.570 align:middle line:84%
a subconscious mind that has
recorded everything that we have

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:32.540 align:middle line:90%
ever done.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's there for our
protection and to inform us,

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:38.920 align:middle line:84%
but it also is
filled with trauma.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And triggering trauma
responses all the time.

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:45.205 align:middle line:84%
And so, what Robert
Sapolsky wrote in his book,

00:26:45.205 --> 00:26:47.800 align:middle line:84%
that we're so
predictable, you can

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.330 align:middle line:84%
tell exactly how
a person is going

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.840 align:middle line:84%
to react in a given situation
because of the subconscious

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.260 align:middle line:90%
programming in them.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So to an extent, there's
truth in-- absolutely,

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.260 align:middle line:90%
we all react subconsciously.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.590 align:middle line:90%
But I would like to--

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:04.270 align:middle line:84%
in a little bit,
we'll go to Kryon

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and have Kryon explain
to us that subtle way

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.730 align:middle line:84%
in which we start
shifting away from being

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:16.425 align:middle line:90%
reactive to being responsive.

00:27:16.425 --> 00:27:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: I'm going
to bring up something--

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Please.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: --that is not
going to sit well with a lot

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:23.550 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's OK.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: Almost everything
that is written in an old

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:32.120 align:middle line:84%
energy, even the things
that are metaphysical,

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.820 align:middle line:90%
don't apply anymore.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And so no matter
who the author was,

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.780 align:middle line:84%
no matter what
the paradigm, what

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:42.140 align:middle line:84%
are the psychologists
written in an old energy

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.910 align:middle line:84%
where we behaved
differently and when

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:48.060 align:middle line:84%
we took our kids to beheadings,
is not applicable today.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot then reference
even the most important things

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:84%
you thought Plato said and then
drag it into an enlightening

00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.730 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:01.522 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I am so glad
you're saying this.

00:28:01.522 --> 00:28:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: Thank you that you
agree because that won't sit

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:04.780 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, I totally agree.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:07.910 align:middle line:84%
You can't take
information born out

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:09.440 align:middle line:84%
of a certain level
of consciousness

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.607 align:middle line:84%
even though they were
the masters of that era.

00:28:11.607 --> 00:28:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: Correct.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's different now.

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: So the next phase
of that is Kryon saying that

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:22.350 align:middle line:84%
the bastions of spiritual
truth that some of us believe,

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:26.430 align:middle line:84%
which is how reincarnation
works, how karma works,

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:32.120 align:middle line:84%
how subconscious works, is going
to be new and different and not

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.420 align:middle line:90%
the old paradigm.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:36.620 align:middle line:84%
You will be able
to drop past life

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.820 align:middle line:84%
irritations because they
won't be in your consciousness

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:40.620 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:44.960 align:middle line:84%
You can drop even the things in
this lifetime that created you.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.410 align:middle line:90%
You have that power.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Our DNA is starting
to work differently,

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.040 align:middle line:90%
activate differently.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.040 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness is
becoming more benevolent,

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.390 align:middle line:90%
more benevolent.

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:57.270 align:middle line:90%
That's the key word, kindness.

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going to be
bothered by those things

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.940 align:middle line:84%
that you have listed
here that we all

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:07.170 align:middle line:84%
have just because of the change
between the old and the new.

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.680 align:middle line:84%
We're not carrying those
things into the new road

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.160 align:middle line:90%
unless we want to.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
who don't know

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.290 align:middle line:84%
they are and have to listen
to a program like this

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:24.380 align:middle line:84%
to realize, wow, what is it that
I'm carrying that I don't want?

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Why don't I feel good in
the morning when I wake up?

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Why am I waking up at 3:00 in
the morning and worrying when

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.500 align:middle line:84%
there's really nothing to worry
about that I can pinpoint,

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.790 align:middle line:90%
and yet I'm disturbed?

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:37.013 align:middle line:84%
These are all part
of the subconscious.

00:29:37.013 --> 00:29:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:39.388 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: Something
is happening.

00:29:39.388 --> 00:29:40.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand it.

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, it's going to be bad.

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:44.908 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so we
demonize the subconscious,

00:29:44.908 --> 00:29:46.210 align:middle line:90%
and that's not fair either.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.510 align:middle line:84%
It's here to help us,
not step in a ditch

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:53.410 align:middle line:90%
or run when we need to.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: Did you know that we
can actually put in front of us

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:59.890 align:middle line:84%
in our future that
is not known to us,

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:03.753 align:middle line:84%
things that will help
us when we get there?

00:30:03.753 --> 00:30:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Talk about
that a little bit.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: OK.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: How many who are
watching this program are

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:16.020 align:middle line:84%
familiar with the term
the now or oneness?

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.720 align:middle line:90%
That is a very old principle.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.310 align:middle line:84%
But it comes with a paradigm
shift of dimensionality.

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:25.952 align:middle line:84%
Now we're getting into
things that people go,

00:30:25.952 --> 00:30:27.160 align:middle line:90%
you're going to lose me here.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.020 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm not going
to lose anybody.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.550 align:middle line:90%
We are in 3D.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:35.040 align:middle line:84%
What if we are broaching that
into a more multidimensional

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:90%
way?

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.270 align:middle line:90%
What if it's not five?

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:40.330 align:middle line:84%
So I want to tell every people,
the next dimension is not five.

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:42.630 align:middle line:90%
You go 1, 2, 3, 4, all.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:43.770 align:middle line:90%
Ask a physicist.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:44.770 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it works.

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.437 align:middle line:84%
So we're not in the
fifth one, and we're

00:30:46.437 --> 00:30:48.220 align:middle line:84%
going to the sixth
one, the seventh one.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.530 align:middle line:84%
That's linear because
you're counting,

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.960 align:middle line:84%
and you can't count in a
multidimensional frame.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:59.982 align:middle line:84%
So you're broaching a whole
new way that reality works.

00:30:59.982 --> 00:31:02.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that you have
in a multidimensional world

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:06.970 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to be in the now,
which encompasses past, present,

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:07.930 align:middle line:90%
and future.

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:11.900 align:middle line:84%
You have some control
over the future.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And, are you ready, you
have control over the past.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:19.450 align:middle line:84%
There is a physics term
called retrocausality

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.420 align:middle line:84%
that says that what
you do today can affect

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.470 align:middle line:90%
the lineage of your past.

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And nobody is going to go there
and say that's impossible.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:28.730 align:middle line:90%
How can that be?

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.300 align:middle line:84%
You can do it in a
multidimensional way

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.650 align:middle line:90%
because you are in the now.

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:38.470 align:middle line:84%
So here I am, and I'm saying,
I am Lee Carroll and in--

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what's coming.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows that future.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.810 align:middle line:84%
They know perhaps
some of the decisions

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:46.070 align:middle line:90%
or perhaps what it contains.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:49.640 align:middle line:84%
But I know that I am
going to go there.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So because I'm in the now and
have a little more control,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.845 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put a benevolent
bomb in front of me.

00:31:55.845 --> 00:31:57.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So when I get there,
I'll know what to say.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:00.950 align:middle line:90%
I'll know what to do.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:02.210 align:middle line:90%
I'll know how to act.

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Love it.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.558 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: And I will
not step in the pothole.

00:32:04.558 --> 00:32:07.700 align:middle line:84%
I'll also not make the same
mistakes I made before.

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Beautiful.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Do you mind if we go into-- you
go into a little channeling mode

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.440 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: Sure.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.360 align:middle line:90%
Let's do that.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And, well, there's so many
things we'll talk about,

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.015 align:middle line:90%
we could talk about.

00:32:18.015 --> 00:32:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: [LAUGHS]

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, you just let me
know when you're feeling ready.

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: You'll
hear a phrase.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Kryon says he's a
magnetic service.

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:28.130 align:middle line:90%
That is another full discussion.

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And just to let
people know, I also

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:35.650 align:middle line:84%
take off my glasses because I'm
not in total control over my arm

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:37.376 align:middle line:90%
movements.

00:32:37.376 --> 00:32:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So I have flipped
off my glasses--

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:40.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:41.470 align:middle line:90%
--in channel.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:42.890 align:middle line:90%
So if you just give me a moment.

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sure.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:46.825 align:middle line:90%


00:32:46.825 --> 00:32:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL:
Greetings, dear ones.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm Kryon, a magnetic service.

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:53.740 align:middle line:90%


00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
lovely to be with you.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Should I go ahead and
ask questions now,

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.850 align:middle line:84%
or would you like
to speak first?

00:32:58.850 --> 00:32:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: I want
to speak first.

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: There is
so much love here.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.290 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Everybody who is watching this
knows, even before the question.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Everyone who is
watching this is known

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:18.120 align:middle line:84%
by that which you call
the creative source.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:22.160 align:middle line:90%
Every soul is known.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Every soul is known
by a name we sing

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:27.650 align:middle line:90%
in light when you're not here.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:33.260 align:middle line:84%
This grand soul of
yours is loved dearly.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And that is that principle,
the core of the message

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:43.580 align:middle line:84%
that I've been giving
all of these years.

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:48.440 align:middle line:84%
You have the ability to control
that which you don't think

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.410 align:middle line:90%
you can control.

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And as you do it, there
is a set of guides,

00:33:54.510 --> 00:34:00.050 align:middle line:84%
you might even call them
angels, who sit with you.

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:02.510 align:middle line:84%
When you go into a closet
and cry by yourself,

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:05.320 align:middle line:84%
we've always been
there, dear one.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And you've always had the
ability to take our hands

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:13.480 align:middle line:84%
and say, tell me what I should
know or help me through this.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And it has nothing to do
with the religion you knew.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:18.670 align:middle line:84%
It has everything
to do with who you

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:23.409 align:middle line:84%
are at the core level, a
piece of the creator itself.

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:25.159 align:middle line:90%
That's the message.

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:26.960 align:middle line:90%
That's the core message.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.850 align:middle line:90%
And then it goes from there.

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:29.655 align:middle line:90%
Questions?

00:34:29.655 --> 00:34:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Beautiful.

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:31.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we touched on something,
Lee and I a little bit

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:40.239 align:middle line:84%
ago, having to do with as
this new consciousness starts

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:43.929 align:middle line:84%
permeating us, that as
we start incarnating

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:46.420 align:middle line:84%
again and reincarnating,
that we're

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:53.590 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to release a
lot of the trauma and heaviness

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:56.980 align:middle line:84%
from the subconscious
that we call karma,

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and karma that we have perhaps
created within our lives out

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.260 align:middle line:90%
of ignorance or whatnot.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us how that works?

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:08.918 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I want to know
the mechanics of it.

00:35:08.918 --> 00:35:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: You want to
know the mechanics of it.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, that now the
subconscious will have less

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.425 align:middle line:84%
of an influence on
us as we incarnate.

00:35:16.425 --> 00:35:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: I ask
you a question.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sure.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.610 align:middle line:90%


00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: When this interview
is over and you get in your car,

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.690 align:middle line:84%
do you go to the glove box
and study the mechanics

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:30.390 align:middle line:84%
of the internal combustion
engine to see how it works

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:32.710 align:middle line:84%
before you step on the
gas and start the car?

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:34.427 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: You don't.

00:35:34.427 --> 00:35:37.560 align:middle line:84%
You trust that
it'll get you there.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.150 align:middle line:90%
That is the new paradigm.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:42.490 align:middle line:90%
There are things happening.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:47.220 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to understand
the minutia of the working parts

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:51.210 align:middle line:84%
of that which is going to be
the spiritual mastery of a human

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:55.410 align:middle line:84%
being that is starting to occur,
through that which we have

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:59.960 align:middle line:84%
called the 24th set of
chromosomes in your DNA,

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:05.300 align:middle line:84%
which are multidimensional,
have always been there,

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:09.920 align:middle line:84%
starting to awaken and giving
you all of these things which

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:14.170 align:middle line:84%
include that which is karma,
which will drop if you ask

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:14.970 align:middle line:90%
for it.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:16.530 align:middle line:90%
Dear spirit, I understand.

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:17.675 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:18.717 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: I understand.

00:36:18.717 --> 00:36:22.430 align:middle line:84%
You say, dear spirit, I would
understand that the old karma

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:23.343 align:middle line:90%
and the old ways.

00:36:23.343 --> 00:36:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to pull
it into this new energy.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.150 align:middle line:90%
No, you're not.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.210 align:middle line:90%
Give intent.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:28.470 align:middle line:90%
Do you want it or not?

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.740 align:middle line:84%
The answer is no,
you can just drop it.

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Dear spirit, I
want my past lives

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:38.420 align:middle line:84%
not to interfere with my mastery
as I go on this new path.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:39.500 align:middle line:90%
Make it so.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:40.710 align:middle line:90%
You're in control.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Don't ask how you're
going to do it.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:48.350 align:middle line:84%
The minutia of the how, turning
to others for many courses

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:51.960 align:middle line:84%
to learn, is an old
energy paradigm.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.690 align:middle line:90%
The courses are inside.

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, they always have
been, just like the veil,

00:36:56.540 --> 00:37:01.330 align:middle line:84%
just like the angel that you
are when you're not here.

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:06.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's go on to--

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:10.940 align:middle line:84%
in very ancient times,
Lemuria, Atlantis,

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:14.890 align:middle line:84%
when we had a different
consciousness on the planet.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:19.120 align:middle line:84%
If you could just give us an
idea of what the consciousness

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.780 align:middle line:90%
was at those times--

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and I know it's risen and
fallen throughout history

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:26.570 align:middle line:90%
to where we are right now.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: There is mythology
even with new age, a lot of it.

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:31.720 align:middle line:84%
They would say we
were smarter then,

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.900 align:middle line:84%
higher consciousness then,
and had higher technology.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.970 align:middle line:84%
That is all things
that you have made up,

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.960 align:middle line:84%
dear ones, in order to
satisfy the hero's journey

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.780 align:middle line:84%
story that you'd like to tell
about a consciousness that

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:47.770 align:middle line:84%
got poor and then is
getting better again.

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Lemuria was a
consciousness that you

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:57.380 align:middle line:84%
were learning the actual
core principles of mastery.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:00.900 align:middle line:84%
How you would say
the soul works?

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.190 align:middle line:84%
How God works, if you
want to use the word God.

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:05.730 align:middle line:90%
It was simple.

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:07.200 align:middle line:90%
It was not complex.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.490 align:middle line:90%
It was not advanced.

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:13.350 align:middle line:84%
You didn't start in
an advanced mastery.

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:17.090 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing here to say
that you arrived on this planet

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:18.380 align:middle line:90%
enlightened.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:19.880 align:middle line:90%
You did not.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Even when you get to
the stories of Atlantis,

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:27.420 align:middle line:84%
do you want to know what
the high technology was?

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.360 align:middle line:84%
The high technology
wasn't technology at all.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.980 align:middle line:84%
It was you learning a
higher consciousness that

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:36.530 align:middle line:84%
then translates to
higher technology

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:38.450 align:middle line:84%
because you were
thinking better.

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So between Lemuria and
the many Atlantises

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:44.420 align:middle line:84%
that there were,
and there were many,

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.640 align:middle line:84%
you are looking at a
learning consciousness,

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:52.500 align:middle line:84%
starting at the basics, being
taught by the star, mothers

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.210 align:middle line:84%
of what it is and
what it is not,

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:59.320 align:middle line:84%
how to pass with joy, how
to understand compassion,

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.800 align:middle line:84%
how to use the things that
you're being given by God.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.120 align:middle line:84%
The garden of Eden training,
if you want to say,

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.420 align:middle line:90%
that's what it was.

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.660 align:middle line:84%
When you look back
to it, it looks

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.470 align:middle line:90%
like a higher consciousness.

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:12.670 align:middle line:90%
It is not.

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:16.360 align:middle line:84%
You have a higher consciousness
today, believe it or not,

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.860 align:middle line:90%
than you did then.

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.470 align:middle line:84%
But the human being wants
to tell the stories,

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:22.030 align:middle line:90%
create the mythology.

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:25.140 align:middle line:84%
A lot of what you are
told, even about Lemuria,

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:28.300 align:middle line:84%
came right from the
scriptures, and even Greeks.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:32.080 align:middle line:84%
You have a technology
that got too big,

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.930 align:middle line:90%
so you were punished then.

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And then perhaps the island sunk
because you did something bad.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.820 align:middle line:90%
That's Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.650 align:middle line:90%
That's not Atlantis.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.150 align:middle line:90%
That's not Lemuria.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:45.300 align:middle line:90%
That's mythology.

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:48.240 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't sit well
with some of you, does it?

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so you're saying
the prevailing consciousness

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:56.730 align:middle line:84%
that's sweeping through the
cosmos now and is affecting

00:39:56.730 --> 00:40:00.970 align:middle line:84%
our transformation on earth,
transformation of consciousness.

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Is this the highest
it's ever been on earth?

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: No.

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:08.200 align:middle line:90%
There is something you've said.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.200 align:middle line:90%
It comes and goes.

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: It comes and goes.

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And then often, the
conquerors will take it away.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.790 align:middle line:84%
There was a very
high consciousness

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:21.700 align:middle line:84%
in the first portions
of the history of Egypt.

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: There is the
same in the Indus Valley.

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:29.570 align:middle line:84%
You had many of these
things where they actually

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:32.700 align:middle line:84%
were using the things
that were given to them

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.710 align:middle line:84%
and retained in
their Lemurian DNA.

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:38.760 align:middle line:84%
But they were then beat
up by the old energy,

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.060 align:middle line:90%
by their conquerors.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.490 align:middle line:90%
You know the story.

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:44.080 align:middle line:84%
So it comes in waves,
if you want to say,

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.090 align:middle line:90%
of high and low consciousness.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:49.730 align:middle line:84%
You are beginning
right now, however,

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:53.270 align:middle line:84%
the highest consciousness
that the planet has ever seen.

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:57.820 align:middle line:84%
By the way, you can
find that same message

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:02.240 align:middle line:84%
on the walls written
in the hieroglyphs,

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:08.560 align:middle line:84%
not in Egypt, but those in Maya,
in the Mayan temples where they

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.930 align:middle line:84%
were looking at the
calendars and seeing

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:15.100 align:middle line:84%
the end of an old energy
calendar, which they put away

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:18.850 align:middle line:84%
in 2012, and put a new
one up that your news

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:20.330 align:middle line:90%
didn't tell you about.

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:24.460 align:middle line:84%
The new one says this has
the potential of the highest

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:26.420 align:middle line:90%
consciousness on the planet.

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Even the Indigenous
were talking about what

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.860 align:middle line:90%
is happening right now.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:37.660 align:middle line:84%
This is the most exciting
thing I could give you.

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:41.290 align:middle line:84%
When I start talking
to humanity and I

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:45.610 align:middle line:84%
see that the love that went into
this, every soul on this planet

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:50.900 align:middle line:84%
came here knowing that it
could have gone the other way.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And it could have gone
right to the Armageddon that

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.100 align:middle line:90%
was predicted.

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Do you realize the love that
went into that from your soul

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:01.430 align:middle line:90%
who said, I'm coming anyway?

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:03.123 align:middle line:84%
Now you know why we
love you so much.

00:42:03.123 --> 00:42:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: And now we know and
now you know that this is a love

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.050 align:middle line:90%
arrangement on this planet.

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And light is winning,
and love will win.

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.270 align:middle line:84%
I certainly have
1,000 more questions,

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:19.920 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have
1,000 more minutes.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.245 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much, Kryon,
for sharing that with us.

00:42:23.245 --> 00:42:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: So it is.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.737 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And, Lee, just
one more tiny little thing.

00:42:26.737 --> 00:42:28.320 align:middle line:84%
We have just a couple
of minutes left.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not tiny.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:29.840 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
bringing Kryon through.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And that is the whole notion of
this little pineal gland that

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:41.660 align:middle line:84%
starts activating, decalcifying,
and starts opening us up

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.860 align:middle line:84%
to our higher selves,
which, of course,

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.630 align:middle line:90%
that the answers lie therein.

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:48.320 align:middle line:84%
How does that start
working for us?

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:49.903 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: This is
a common metaphor.

00:42:49.903 --> 00:42:50.820 align:middle line:90%
They've known it for--

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the reason the
Bindi is there at all

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.390 align:middle line:84%
is the mark of the third eye,
which aligns to the pineal.

00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:59.550 align:middle line:84%
The pineal has always been
seen as the window to the soul.

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:02.990 align:middle line:10%
So as the soul
starts to graduate

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:05.720 align:middle line:10%
and we start to see the
veil lifting inside,

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:10.430 align:middle line:10%
this means that we are getting
a lot more information sailing

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:11.730 align:middle line:10%
through that pineal.

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's the mechanics
of it, because you

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:14.900 align:middle line:90%
wanted the mechanics of it.

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:19.520 align:middle line:84%
That start to activate that
which is the Statue of David

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.170 align:middle line:90%
that we're starting to carve.

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:25.140 align:middle line:84%
We have always had
that, born magnificent.

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I would love anybody who
goes away from this show

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:32.960 align:middle line:84%
to remember that because this
is against the programming most

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.340 align:middle line:90%
of us have ever had.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.830 align:middle line:90%
So you're not worthy.

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Even our parents, some of
our parents, telling us that.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.370 align:middle line:84%
I was very fortunate there was
love in my life and my family.

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was told I
could do anything.

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Now, lucky you.

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: Yes.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Not everyone was.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>> CARROLL: We can.

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:49.077 align:middle line:90%
We are born magnificent.

00:43:49.077 --> 00:43:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I want
people to understand

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:55.388 align:middle line:84%
and start cognizing that
therefore, I can do anything.

00:43:55.388 --> 00:43:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, because it seems
to me there are an awful lot

00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:01.590 align:middle line:84%
of species out there
that are watching us here

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:05.100 align:middle line:84%
because of the dynamics that are
taking place right now that this

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:08.670 align:middle line:84%
species is waking up to,
which is to be in this kind

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:10.840 align:middle line:84%
of resistance, to be
in a physical body,

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.390 align:middle line:84%
but have that amount of light
and love at the same time.

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:15.473 align:middle line:84%
>> CARROLL: Another subject
that people said, hey,

00:44:15.473 --> 00:44:18.450 align:middle line:84%
why are all those around us in
a universe that is filled with

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:20.803 align:middle line:84%
life, simply standing
by and watching?

00:44:20.803 --> 00:44:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Why haven't they landed yet?

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:23.012 align:middle line:10%
Why haven't they come by?

00:44:23.012 --> 00:44:24.250 align:middle line:10%
Why haven't they said that--

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:27.270 align:middle line:10%
and the answer is very
basic and understanding

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:28.810 align:middle line:10%
and very practical.

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:30.276 align:middle line:90%
We are barbaric.

00:44:30.276 --> 00:44:32.010 align:middle line:90%

that they'll be destroyed when

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:35.443 align:middle line:90%

You had all these ET,
these extraterrestrials

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.580 align:middle line:84%
that would come and talk
with Eisenhower and people

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:50.180 align:middle line:90%
gentlemanly.

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.340 align:middle line:90%
There was no threat.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
something happened.

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:54.920 align:middle line:90%
It shifted.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.210 align:middle line:84%

consciousness shift,

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:57.340 align:middle line:90%
the ups and downs.

00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:59.850 align:middle line:84%

became enemies, you know?

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:01.250 align:middle line:90%
Shoot them down.

Thank you so much.
