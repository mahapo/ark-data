>>FRANK DE LUCA:
I try to present

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.360 align:middle line:84%
the Enneagram more as a
lens, kind of a narrow lens.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.797 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is
you see a broad view.

00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: You're
still OK if you know yourself.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.020 align:middle line:90%
But if you don't?

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: If you don't,
you're in trouble I think.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Underneath each type is one
version of I'm not lovable.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm not worthy.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a way to try
to fill up that gap.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.720 align:middle line:84%
There's some knowledge and
a lot of mystery around it.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:84%
You could say that we
are each a piece of work.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: You could also say
we are each a work of art.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.250 align:middle line:90%
And both are true.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.850 align:middle line:84%
What you add to that exclamation
point is a question mark

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.220 align:middle line:84%
and say, I have to
do this this way.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Well, don't I?

>>REGINA: In my previous
conversation with Frank De

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.980 align:middle line:10%
Luca, we gave an
overview of the Enneagram

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:10%
and touched on some
of the personality

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.040 align:middle line:10%
types and their dynamics.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.020 align:middle line:84%
Today, Frank is back
with us, and we're

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.590 align:middle line:84%
going to take a deeper dive into
the potential of the Enneagram

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.660 align:middle line:90%
in all of our relationships.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:84%
His new book is titled
"A Field Guide to Humans:

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Enriching Relationships
Through the Enneagram."

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.100 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Frank.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.350 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to see you again.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Thank you.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me back.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I loved the conversation
I had last time with you.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And you got a good
response to it.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.300 align:middle line:84%
People want to
know more about it.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.712 align:middle line:84%
And I know that because
you're back already.

00:01:24.712 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle line:84%
That means you were
really popular.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.850 align:middle line:90%

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.142 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: I'm glad to hear that.

00:01:28.142 --> 00:01:31.420 align:middle line:84%
It's this material that is
so captivating for people.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And once you touch it, you think
that there's something here,

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.490 align:middle line:90%
and I want to follow what it is.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.740 align:middle line:90%
So I'm happy to talk about it.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you did--

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.590 align:middle line:84%
I said this last time,
and I will say it again

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.600 align:middle line:90%
because your book is out.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.692 align:middle line:84%
I saw an early version before
it went through the editing

00:01:45.692 --> 00:01:46.650 align:middle line:90%
process and everything.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was so blown away by
the essential nature of it.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, you took so
much and boiled it down

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:84%
in a beautiful, beautifully
illustrated small book

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.040 align:middle line:84%
to the essence of
each of these types.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.918 align:middle line:84%
And that took, well, a lifetime
of doing the Enneagram.

00:02:04.918 --> 00:02:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: It took a bit of work.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.259 align:middle line:84%
I really respect what you
did because it's useful.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can sit down and use it.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: That was my idea, this
should be accessible to people

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:84%
without having to be taken
away by too much information

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.250 align:middle line:84%
or theory that you're
really not ready for.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.280 align:middle line:84%
There's so many layers
to the Enneagram.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to present
just a layer that

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:84%
will be helpful immediately
in your relationship.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.740 align:middle line:90%
So kudos to you.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So first thing I
want to find out

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.530 align:middle line:84%
is sometimes when people
use the Enneagram,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:84%
you use it to put others
more than yourself in a box.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And you said that's not how the
Enneagram is meant to be used.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a lens.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you would please go ahead
and explain the difference

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.560 align:middle line:84%
between those so we don't get in
some bad habits using Enneagram

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.160 align:middle line:90%
right off the bat.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yeah.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.768 align:middle line:84%
Try to correct that
from the start.

00:02:51.768 --> 00:02:53.650 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's easy because
we could think--

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.160 align:middle line:10%
well, we read a
little description,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.230 align:middle line:10%
and we decide, oh, I know.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.640 align:middle line:90%
You must be a five.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And then it's kind of like
the conversation is done.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.380 align:middle line:90%
I have it down.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.620 align:middle line:84%
I read something about fives,
and you definitely are a five.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.387 align:middle line:10%
And if I'm on the
receiving end of that,

00:03:10.387 --> 00:03:12.720 align:middle line:10%
especially if I don't know
anything about the Enneagram,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.570 align:middle line:10%
it's like, what did
you just do to me?

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.040 align:middle line:10%
It's like-- I say--

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:10%
I think it's a conviction.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.330 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, I've got it.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.430 align:middle line:84%
The other way-- and
it's also a box.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And some people object to the
Enneagram or any typing system

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:90%
to say I'm all of these.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.870 align:middle line:90%
Or don't put me here.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm more than this.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.510 align:middle line:90%
You are.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.670 align:middle line:84%
But if you take
the time to notice,

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.030 align:middle line:90%
we tend to be patterned people.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.970 align:middle line:84%
We tend to-- and people who
know us see our patterns more

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:90%
than we do.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:84%
How often in a
relationship to someone

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.030 align:middle line:90%
say "you always," "you never."

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.670 align:middle line:84%
That means they're
seeing a pattern.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And you might say,
oh, I never do that.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.220 align:middle line:90%
Well, every day you do that.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- and we are blind
to our own habitual nature.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: It's exactly right.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So I try to present the
Enneagram more as a lens,

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:90%
meaning look through this.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.360 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a narrow lens.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.270 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is
you see a broad view.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:84%
You begin to see someone
in their complexity.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:84%
You begin to see where
they-- what might

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.320 align:middle line:90%
be going on inside of them.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the Enneagram,
in boxing people in,

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.850 align:middle line:90%
their behavior is fixed.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And the Enneagram
says it really isn't

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.380 align:middle line:84%
so much about your
behavior what your type is,

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.090 align:middle line:90%
but what's motivating you?

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Why do you act that way?

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.320 align:middle line:84%
That's why people have a
hard time typing themselves

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.230 align:middle line:84%
or others because we all act
like these different types

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.760 align:middle line:90%
at different times.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a while
to see what I'm

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.720 align:middle line:90%
calling the hidden personality.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And the Enneagram is
really talking about what

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:90%
we don't see about ourselves.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that seems
very apparent.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:84%
You and I were talking when you
were getting your hair coiffed,

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.672 align:middle line:90%
you know, about--

00:04:55.672 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I think
I'm this, this, and this.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, hmm,
but are you really?

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like we see
ourselves as one way.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.292 align:middle line:84%
And because this is almost
kind of a self-diagnosis--

00:05:05.292 --> 00:05:06.750 align:middle line:84%
you can do it
through software too,

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.400 align:middle line:84%
and it'll kind of
give you types--

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.410 align:middle line:84%
we're only going through
our lens of perception

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.430 align:middle line:90%
about ourselves.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Right.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good point.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And there are typing tests,
and you can do things,

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.798 align:middle line:90%
and it can be helpful.

00:05:17.798 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:84%
As you know, the trouble
with that is we're

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:84%
going to see ourselves
a certain way.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we choose the
type that we would like to be.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And also I've seen, for
example, recently more

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.832 align:middle line:84%
men like to type themselves
as eights because they

00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:90%
think it's a more masculine--

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Power.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.595 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: --type.

00:05:32.595 --> 00:05:33.870 align:middle line:90%
The power, right.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:84%
It takes a while to
really discover your type.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.160 align:middle line:90%
I never push it.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I never-- I try not to
type people because it's

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.387 align:middle line:90%
a discovery process.

00:05:43.387 --> 00:05:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
mean about the lens.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.040 align:middle line:84%
You can take this and
put it on yourself.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think people
should ever believe,

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.820 align:middle line:84%
even if someone else types
them, or three tests say this,

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.400 align:middle line:90%
you have to verify it yourself.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.890 align:middle line:84%
You have to start to ask
the questions really?

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:90%
Is that true about me?

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And it starts a process
of self-discovery.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And so one layer-- outer
layer-- of the Enneagram

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.200 align:middle line:90%
is these personalities.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.790 align:middle line:84%
But you go a step further
and say, is this true for me?

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And as I think I said
before, the Enneagram

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:84%
is not particularly
kind to our egos.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.322 align:middle line:84%
It's not here to
make us feel better.

00:06:19.322 --> 00:06:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.380 align:middle line:90%
And in the book even--

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.920 align:middle line:84%
lovely, but it'll show the
elevated and detrimental aspect

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.235 align:middle line:90%
of each of these aspects.

00:06:27.235 --> 00:06:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yeah.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And if we're able to
handle that truth,

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.825 align:middle line:90%
it's a very liberating system.

00:06:31.825 --> 00:06:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody has the
elevated and detrimental

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.050 align:middle line:90%
in them.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.120 align:middle line:84%
We're all struggling to learn
in some area of our life.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Exactly.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So not to be afraid
of that and say, oh, no,

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I have to be perfect,
and get back--

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.020 align:middle line:84%
because I interrupted
you on that, too--

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:84%
going back to the
eight, and men trying

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.650 align:middle line:84%
tending to overidentify with
the powerful and the eight.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.140 align:middle line:84%
What about-- I'm
wondering generationally

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.940 align:middle line:90%
what that might look like?

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm wondering
about the younger

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.690 align:middle line:90%
millennials and zoomers.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Because oftentimes, the girls
are kind of outpacing them

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.417 align:middle line:90%
in some basic levels now.

00:07:05.417 --> 00:07:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: That's a good question.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.580 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't really
thought about that.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.280 align:middle line:90%
I think that some--

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.740 align:middle line:84%
well, there's personality
types, and then there's

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.750 align:middle line:90%
the archetype of each one.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And certain times in
cultures, for example,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.540 align:middle line:84%
men might have been expected
to be more in the eight role.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.663 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean they
were necessarily eights.

00:07:23.663 --> 00:07:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think what you're
alluding to with the younger

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.560 align:middle line:84%
generation is it isn't quite
as fixed in gender roles

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.010 align:middle line:84%
definitely, or in having
to be a certain way.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.220 align:middle line:90%
And so I think that--

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.400 align:middle line:84%
I haven't-- some people
do try to look at trends.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.288 align:middle line:84%
Are there more of these types
at certain types of generations?

00:07:41.288 --> 00:07:43.080 align:middle line:84%
No one really has much
evidence about that.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like my
dad's generation

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.300 align:middle line:90%
compared to a zoomer.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.530 align:middle line:90%
It's like, holy cow.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.540 align:middle line:84%
But then, of course,
if I can just say this,

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.540 align:middle line:84%
there is reincarnation
in my book-- in my mind,

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.770 align:middle line:90%
there is reincarnation.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.655 align:middle line:84%
And my dad's generation
and his dads are back.

00:07:56.655 --> 00:07:58.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they are zoomers
and millennials now.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.322 align:middle line:84%
And they bring those
imprints through, too.

00:08:00.322 --> 00:08:03.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these things take a
long time to cycle through--

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Lives.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:04.732 align:middle line:90%
Lifetimes, yeah.

00:08:04.732 --> 00:08:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, lifetimes.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And they can bring
back propensities

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.870 align:middle line:90%
like putting a little--

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.260 align:middle line:84%
carrying an attaché case and
wearing a buttoned-up shirt

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.130 align:middle line:90%
to eighth grade.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.300 align:middle line:90%
It's like, grandpa's back.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Right.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know if it's
really a personality

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.900 align:middle line:90%
and cultural overlay.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.240 align:middle line:90%
Same with the Enneagram.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people
can't see themselves

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.570 align:middle line:84%
because maybe they work
in a company that's

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:90%
very three-oriented.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.990 align:middle line:84%
They have to take on
three characteristics,

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.507 align:middle line:90%
but they're not really a three.

00:08:32.507 --> 00:08:34.049 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know
that because they

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:84%
become that for so many
years in order to get along

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:37.809 align:middle line:90%
or to survive.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that's
where stress is.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.150 align:middle line:84%
If someone is in
an environment that

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.880 align:middle line:84%
expects them to behave in
a certain way that's not

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.010 align:middle line:84%
their native land,
you might say,

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.920 align:middle line:84%
you're always having to
push against your more

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.977 align:middle line:90%
natural tendencies.

00:08:50.977 --> 00:08:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you've seen
this a lot because you're also

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.420 align:middle line:90%
a counselor.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Your background is
in psychology, right?

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Mm-hmm.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you've
dealt with a lot of people,

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.180 align:middle line:84%
both on an interpersonal
level, marriage and family.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.982 align:middle line:84%
But also, just what
you're talking about,

00:09:02.982 --> 00:09:04.440 align:middle line:84%
is how you have to
present yourself

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:90%
in your professional world.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not asking for
percentages, but is it common

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.060 align:middle line:84%
that someone is actually
presenting who they really

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.280 align:middle line:84%
truly are when they show up in
their power world around them?

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.532 align:middle line:84%
Are we often having
to wear masks?

00:09:17.532 --> 00:09:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Oh, there's
a lot of that.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's just-- that's
just how life is.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you just deal with it.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.120 align:middle line:84%
This is where
self-awareness really helps.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that most
stress that people experience is

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.890 align:middle line:84%
they just don't know
themselves well enough.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:84%
If you know yourself
well enough,

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.758 align:middle line:84%
and you're in an
environment that's

00:09:34.758 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:84%
demanding you behave
in certain ways,

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.807 align:middle line:84%
you can kind of figure
out a way through that.

00:09:39.807 --> 00:09:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can fake it.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: You can kind
of fake it if you want.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.320 align:middle line:90%
And you know who you really are.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're still
OK if you know yourself,

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:90%
but if you don't?

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: If you don't,
you're in trouble, I think.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Because then you don't
know who the real self is

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:90%
and how you might normally be.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And so you're going to be
pushing against your tendency.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And I find the
Enneagram-- once you

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:02.220 align:middle line:84%
begin to kind of see
your basic nature,

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.590 align:middle line:84%
you can align yourself more
with that in the positive way,

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:06.390 align:middle line:90%
hopefully.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And we all
keep saying, we all

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.070 align:middle line:84%
can take on behaviors of
any of the nine types.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.710 align:middle line:84%
There are certain times--
when I was doing a book,

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:84%
and working with an editor, and
thinking about presentation,

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.220 align:middle line:84%
and thinking about
now getting that

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.210 align:middle line:84%
into the marketplace, that's
a very three function.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.590 align:middle line:90%
I want this to look good.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:90%
I want it to be successful.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.240 align:middle line:84%
I want to bring people around
me who can make this successful.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.190 align:middle line:90%
I want to be known for this.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.812 align:middle line:84%
That's not my native
land, actually.

00:10:33.812 --> 00:10:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are--
tell me your number.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: I'm a type one.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.540 align:middle line:84%
My focus is I want
to get it done right.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:84%
This has to be exactly
perfect from the get-go.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my gosh.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.575 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
engage with an editor.

00:10:43.575 --> 00:10:44.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Who was a one, I think.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: We're not sure.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.090 align:middle line:90%
But editing is a good example.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.000 align:middle line:90%
Editing is a one function.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.530 align:middle line:90%
You have to be exacting.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.570 align:middle line:84%
You have to try to
get the words right.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.550 align:middle line:90%
You want to present correctly.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.620 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean
the editor was a one,

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.880 align:middle line:84%
but she was functioning
in that role.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, as a
one, it can be real hell

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.150 align:middle line:84%
because I'm already worried
about getting it right.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And have someone
else who's getting--

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.270 align:middle line:90%
make sure my words are right.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.728 align:middle line:84%
We went back and
forth quite a bit.

00:11:12.728 --> 00:11:13.853 align:middle line:90%
I went through some stress.

00:11:13.853 --> 00:11:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's
an exhausting process

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.700 align:middle line:90%
under the best of circumstances.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And I had to kind
of borrow on the three,

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:20.900 align:middle line:90%
I'll have to admit.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.550 align:middle line:90%
It said, this is good enough.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:27.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had Enneagram teachers
verify this is good enough.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.410 align:middle line:84%
But my job was to
say, but I want this

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:31.820 align:middle line:90%
to go out in the world more.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And threes are
really good at that.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:90%
They understand presentation.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.920 align:middle line:84%
They understand knowing
what people want

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:90%
and how to present that.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And so as a one, at
root, it can feel like,

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.260 align:middle line:90%
but it's got to have integrity.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.232 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm in integrity.

00:11:47.232 --> 00:11:49.190 align:middle line:84%
But there were certain
things in the book where

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.830 align:middle line:84%
I had to say, this
is good enough,

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:90%
and it's time to keep it moving.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And a three has a very
forward-moving energy.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:57.620 align:middle line:90%
We have a goal.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:58.770 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get there.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:02.098 align:middle line:84%
So I had to borrow on
the three quite a bit.

00:12:02.098 --> 00:12:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm glad you
talked about the one

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.630 align:middle line:84%
because a little
later on in our talk,

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:08.330 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get to
some type combinations.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.087 align:middle line:84%
And the only one that
wasn't included was the one.

00:12:11.087 --> 00:12:13.670 align:middle line:84%
So now we just found-- tell us
a little bit more about the one

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.360 align:middle line:84%
again, about yourself, besides
the need to have things right,

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:84%
that sense of
integrity, perfection.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: It's an innate drive.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:26.240 align:middle line:84%
If you go down a few layers in
the Enneagram and motivation,

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and even kind of
existential motivation

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.910 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual motivation--
because the Enneagram

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:90%
is based in spirituality.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And so for a one, what
feels like what is missing

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.090 align:middle line:84%
is that somehow I
haven't gotten there.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm not quite good enough.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I want to avoid being bad,
making mistakes, certainly

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:84%
failing, doing things wrong,
being noticed and being

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:52.610 align:middle line:90%
corrected on something.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Being humiliated.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Being humiliated.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a sense of,
I've got to be really good

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.840 align:middle line:84%
and get things right,
or I'm not lovable.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.180 align:middle line:84%
So underneath each type is one
version of, I'm not lovable.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm not worthy.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And you could say that
our personalities are

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:13.170 align:middle line:84%
a reaction to that, or it's a
way to try to fill up that gap.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is at the
basis of all humanity,

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.352 align:middle line:90%
a lack of self-esteem.

00:13:17.352 --> 00:13:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Lack of self-esteem.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Enneagram even
goes deeper and says,

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:middle line:84%
we've lost our connection
to our divine self.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, which is why we
have the self-esteem issues.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Right.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me ask you a
question now because you just

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.860 align:middle line:84%
brought it up, and we didn't
talk about it last time.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And you said because this is
a spiritual type of endeavor,

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:38.330 align:middle line:90%
the Enneagram.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.130 align:middle line:90%
What is it actually based on?

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I asked you
that in our first interview.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.197 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: I talked a
little bit about it,

00:13:44.197 --> 00:13:47.940 align:middle line:84%
but there's some knowledge and
a lot of mystery around it.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Well, the symbol
itself, from what we know--

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.380 align:middle line:90%
it's more speculation.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Some people try
to research this,

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.310 align:middle line:84%
but it could have been from
Pythagoras and going back

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.010 align:middle line:84%
to the Greeks, as far
as sacred geometry.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Others say it kind of
similar to the tree of life,

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and we have this projection
of these nine elements here.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:13.250 align:middle line:10%
And it certainly-- it comes
from mystical traditions, not

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.700 align:middle line:10%
the exoteric religions.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.500 align:middle line:10%
But--

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.300 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Such as?

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Well, in
Islam, in Christianity,

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.650 align:middle line:84%
in Christian mysticism,
in Buddhism and Eastern

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.510 align:middle line:84%
philosophy as well,
there's a sense--

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.000 align:middle line:84%
there's a psychology
in there about what

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.500 align:middle line:90%
is the nature of the universe.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.510 align:middle line:84%
It didn't start
with personalities.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.000 align:middle line:84%
The Enneagram, as the
symbol, started with kind

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.085 align:middle line:90%
of a map of the universe.

00:14:33.085 --> 00:14:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
was just going to ask.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.240 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like nine
energies causing--

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: It's actually
three energies.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.920 align:middle line:84%
If you see, in the
middle of the triangle--

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.050 align:middle line:84%
at the middle of the
circle, there's a triangle.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's where the nine,
the three, and the six are.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.090 align:middle line:90%
And so this is the law of three.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Where we could look
at-- you can go back

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.180 align:middle line:90%
to the Egyptian parlance.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.995 align:middle line:84%
You could say Isis, Osiris,
Horus-- the masculine,

00:14:55.995 --> 00:14:56.795 align:middle line:90%
feminine and--

00:14:56.795 --> 00:14:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Just repeats.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:58.830 align:middle line:90%
It repeats everywhere.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: So you can see
this repeating pattern

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.350 align:middle line:90%
in many traditions.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And the Enneagram is
built on that triad.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.960 align:middle line:90%
So there's the three energies.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.820 align:middle line:84%
In one way we say--
in the Enneagram--

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.960 align:middle line:90%
it's like one is moving forward.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:13.760 align:middle line:90%
One is whoa.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:90%
Let's wait a minute-- slow down.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And the top one is saying,
let's mediate between these two

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.130 align:middle line:90%
forces.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's really the experience
of the forces of the universe.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And what we know is then that
in the early 20th century,

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.487 align:middle line:84%
the first time a symbol kind
of appeared again, we will say.

00:15:32.487 --> 00:15:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Although, we don't
have documentation.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right It was brought
through from somewhere,

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.290 align:middle line:90%
sometime.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:37.623 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: It was brought through.

00:15:37.623 --> 00:15:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And Gurdjieff, who was
a mystic philosopher,

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:42.990 align:middle line:84%
was the one who put
this into his teachings.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:45.200 align:middle line:84%
He didn't talk so much
about personalities

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:84%
but about the
energies of each one.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And he had a sense of how to
work with students to wake them

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.640 align:middle line:90%
up by using the Enneagram.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.977 align:middle line:84%
So there is where it
kind of came through.

00:15:54.977 --> 00:15:56.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't know quite how
it came through him.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:84%
But I think I mentioned Oscar
Ichazo, another kind of mystic,

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.950 align:middle line:84%
philosopher, teacher
who just died--

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:06.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- maybe five years
ago, who began to use this

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and talked about ego fixations
and several Enneagons,

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:12.272 align:middle line:90%
he called it.

00:16:12.272 --> 00:16:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And here's where we get the
Enneagram of personality,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:84%
the Enneagram of the virtues,
the Enneagram or the Holy ideas

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.310 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:22.580 align:middle line:84%
They came into more popular
personality beginning

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.710 align:middle line:84%
in the '70s through
Claudio Naranjo,

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.970 align:middle line:84%
who was a psychiatrist trained
in personality systems--

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.770 align:middle line:90%
also a mystic.

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.110 align:middle line:84%
I heard an interview
with him that was taped.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And he said basically it was
kind of like automatic writing,

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.010 align:middle line:84%
how he really got
to this material.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So he used his Western mind
and his more mystical mind.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And that was when the Enneagram
came-- in about the '70s--

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:48.680 align:middle line:90%
came into.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.013 align:middle line:90%
He taught it to a few people.

00:16:50.013 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And from that group,
it began to spread.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It really
came into the West.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Because I first remember
hearing about it in the '80s.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And people were using it
a lot in the workplace

00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:59.420 align:middle line:90%
in corporate world--

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Already, then?

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.470 align:middle line:90%
OK, yeah.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --relationships
in general.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.430 align:middle line:84%
But I remember--
maybe I was just

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.010 align:middle line:84%
tapped into people who were
using it for the workplace.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:12.829 align:middle line:84%
But it was to see the functional
compatibilities of people.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:14.359 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a moment

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:16.099 align:middle line:90%
because it's all relationships.

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Do you do some of that between
members of the same group

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.880 align:middle line:90%
or corporation?

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yes.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.550 align:middle line:90%
I have used it.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I've done consulting, leadership
training, and team building,

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.090 align:middle line:90%
and I use it with discretion.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.940 align:middle line:84%
The Enneagram, to
really learn it,

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.130 align:middle line:90%
takes a bit of vulnerability.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:38.340 align:middle line:84%
You have to be willing to open
and to disclose and to have

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.140 align:middle line:90%
someone--

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.788 align:middle line:90%
it's like an X-ray machine.

00:17:40.788 --> 00:17:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And so you're in a group
of people you work with,

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and the light is
shining there on you.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:46.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's like that.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.290 align:middle line:84%
So I only used it--
what I preferred to do,

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and I did more of this,
was to work with leaders.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Because, for example, some
years ago I was in a period

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.120 align:middle line:84%
where I did a lot of
consulting with people

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:90%
who were in creative fields--

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.690 align:middle line:90%
interior design.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Then I got referred to
the landscape architect

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:07.835 align:middle line:84%
company, decorative
painting company--

00:18:07.835 --> 00:18:09.710 align:middle line:84%
all these people who
were in creative fields.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And I found that if I
worked with the leader,

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.400 align:middle line:90%
that would help.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.610 align:middle line:84%
But I did work with
someone who heard about me,

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.920 align:middle line:84%
and he hired me with
his small company.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And he was frustrated all
the time with his employees.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of got
a sense this man

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.590 align:middle line:84%
was a four, which some
deeply creative people are--

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:31.622 align:middle line:90%
pretty dramatic, moody--

00:18:31.622 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Little
judgmental, maybe?

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: A little judgmental.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.022 align:middle line:84%
Brilliant in many ways,
but he had no idea

00:18:37.022 --> 00:18:39.230 align:middle line:84%
how to relate to his staff
or take care of his staff.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.550 align:middle line:84%
He was just over his
head all the time.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And so he wanted me to go
and work with his staff

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.932 align:middle line:84%
so that they wouldn't
complain to him.

00:18:47.932 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Not a great arrangement
for a consultant.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, that's not--

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.340 align:middle line:90%
That's a big setup.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: It didn't
last too long.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Because it was like, please,
I can't-- and as a four,

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.658 align:middle line:84%
what he would do is he
would pay them more.

00:18:59.658 --> 00:19:00.950 align:middle line:90%
He would do-- he would try to--

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just do it.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:01.880 align:middle line:90%
Here's money.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:03.837 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Just please
leave me alone.

00:19:03.837 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:84%
What do you need from me--
kind of a two side of things.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.700 align:middle line:90%
How can I help you out?

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.260 align:middle line:90%
That didn't go so well.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So I learned through time
not to take on that dynamic.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.110 align:middle line:90%
So let me ask you.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:16.075 align:middle line:84%
In a situation where
you have a four who's

00:19:16.075 --> 00:19:17.450 align:middle line:84%
trying to be the
boss but doesn't

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:20.330 align:middle line:84%
know how to relate
to people as well,

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:24.260 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it be best if
they had a built-in mediary

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.122 align:middle line:90%
between others?

00:19:26.122 --> 00:19:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Well, that's--

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
wouldn't they hire

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.640 align:middle line:84%
someone that would be--
what type could balance them

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.760 align:middle line:84%
out and relate well
to the employees?

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Well, I think he had
his top person there was a one,

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.540 align:middle line:90%
and we can get things organized.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:42.980 align:middle line:90%
But that's true.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.040 align:middle line:84%
You can either substitute and
get someone who can do the job.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Or if someone's
willing, they can

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.710 align:middle line:84%
learn how to be a leader
from a four perspective.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But if they can't,
they'd be a wise person--

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: If they can't,
then they have to-- they're

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:54.940 align:middle line:90%
going to be paying the price.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to
bring someone else.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, to bring someone else in.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: But if they're
aware enough, yes,

00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.080 align:middle line:84%
they can bring in,
let's say, a three.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.040 align:middle line:90%
They can bring in someone else.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's not a failure.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: No.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.780 align:middle line:84%
But, again, a little
bit of awareness.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.430 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't aware that he was
driving his employees crazy.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.287 align:middle line:84%
So there's where the
self-awareness comes in.

00:20:09.287 --> 00:20:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
go back to what you

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:12.120 align:middle line:90%
talked about a little bit ago.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So this guy has that-- his
hidden dynamics going on.

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.960 align:middle line:84%
They're hidden
mostly from himself.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And we all have hidden
dynamics going on.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.230 align:middle line:84%
What does it require besides
vulnerability and humility

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:27.070 align:middle line:84%
to really start excavating
and allow ourselves to have

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.050 align:middle line:90%
revealed what's underneath--

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:90%
good and bad?

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.800 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people can't
see their good stuff.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: This is true.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.297 align:middle line:90%
You know, I think--

00:20:36.297 --> 00:20:37.630 align:middle line:90%
this is-- it's a great question.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I-- but even
before the Enneagram,

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.080 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing personal
growth work and so forth.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And I can always see some
people seem to wake up and be

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:90%
willing to look and others not.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.710 align:middle line:84%
I could never predict exactly
who that would happen to.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways,
it takes a wound,

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.758 align:middle line:90%
some major hit, some failure.

00:20:55.758 --> 00:20:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big gash in the side.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:57.883 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: A big gash.

00:20:57.883 --> 00:20:59.470 align:middle line:90%
A hit the head--

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:00.340 align:middle line:90%
side of the head.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.290 align:middle line:90%
And they go, oh.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:03.970 align:middle line:90%
That sometimes happens.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.680 align:middle line:84%
In a company, for example,
though, when you're the boss,

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.650 align:middle line:84%
you're kind of protected
from rebellion.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:11.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, you're
in a power position.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.360 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, people
have to kind of work

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.830 align:middle line:90%
around your ego and your--

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I think-- I believe this
man knew he was a four.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.520 align:middle line:90%
But that was all he knew.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle line:90%
Just a number.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: It was just a number.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:23.932 align:middle line:84%
And he could see it
happening, but he

00:21:23.932 --> 00:21:25.460 align:middle line:90%
couldn't do anything about it.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:84%
So what someone
does with that is

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.570 align:middle line:90%
there has to be some moment--

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:30.070 align:middle line:84%
and I kind of put
that in the book--

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.870 align:middle line:90%
that there's an aha moment.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it happens
through relationship.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really
through relationship

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:90%
that can be the catalyst to--

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One kind or another.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: --to go deeper in
there and say, what is this?

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Why am I left in
this same pattern

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:84%
again of feeling
rejected, or that people

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.440 align:middle line:84%
don't understand me, or they
won't do what I want them to.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Why is it I've gone
through several employees,

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.510 align:middle line:84%
several relationships, several
friendships, and the same thing

00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.380 align:middle line:90%
occurs.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.360 align:middle line:84%
It's that moment
when someone can

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.180 align:middle line:84%
say, what's the same in
all of these scenarios?

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.167 align:middle line:90%
Oh, me.

00:22:07.167 --> 00:22:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, what about me?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what is
that function within us

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:84%
that holds so tightly
to our stories of self,

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:18.590 align:middle line:84%
that we feel that if we allow
that vulnerable truth to come

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.360 align:middle line:90%
through, we're going to what?

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.380 align:middle line:90%
Dissolve?

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.030 align:middle line:90%
Not exist anymore?

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:24.900 align:middle line:84%
What is it we're
so terrified of?

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: I know.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.658 align:middle line:84%
There's where I kind of
go to that we're really

00:22:27.658 --> 00:22:29.720 align:middle line:90%
all pretty tender.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:90%
We're protective.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.120 align:middle line:84%
None of us want to
be wounded again.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And our personality,
in many ways,

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.270 align:middle line:84%
is a protection
against that wounding.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:42.237 align:middle line:84%
So we identify with the
shield or the armor.

00:22:42.237 --> 00:22:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The story.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: The story.

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And the story is that
it's a spiritual answer.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:48.407 align:middle line:90%
It's a psychological answer.

00:22:48.407 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's deep.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:50.923 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: It's many things.

00:22:50.923 --> 00:22:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But most
people have it,

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.477 align:middle line:84%
to one degree or another,
this self-protection.

00:22:54.477 --> 00:22:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Well, I remember before
I got into this kind of work,

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.010 align:middle line:90%
when I was--

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:01.080 align:middle line:84%
even in my 20s, I remember
driving by Esalen, for example,

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.460 align:middle line:84%
in California where people
are-- this is in the '60s, '70s.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.470 align:middle line:84%
People are doing all
these wild workshops

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and exposing themselves
and so forth.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.590 align:middle line:90%
A lot of nudity.

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: And I thought, no way.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.430 align:middle line:84%
I got into the human potential
movement early on in my 20s,

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.610 align:middle line:84%
where intensive workshops
of exploration and kind

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:20.720 align:middle line:90%
of revealing things.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Then I began to see
the value of it.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:26.000 align:middle line:84%
But it usually took someone
either holding my hand

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:84%
and saying, really,
this is not so bad.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think that most good
things come into our life

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.990 align:middle line:90%
through good relationship--

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.960 align:middle line:84%
someone we trust,
someone that helps us.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Someone that
sees us for what we truly

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.630 align:middle line:84%
are and accepts the parts
that aren't perfect.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: That's
a big part of it.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.040 align:middle line:10%
And this is where I
love the Enneagram

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.380 align:middle line:10%
because it gives you that lens.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:10%
And I tried to put in the book--

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.960 align:middle line:10%
I have that quote in the
opening to the chapter,

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.270 align:middle line:10%
to the introduction,
that says, you

00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:00.140 align:middle line:10%
could say that we are
each a piece of work.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.650 align:middle line:84%
You could also say we
are each a work of art.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.680 align:middle line:90%
And both are true.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And to me, the Enneagram
gives you the lens

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.910 align:middle line:90%
where you see the whole picture.

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And once you see that
work of art in there,

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:15.160 align:middle line:84%
you begin to relate
to someone there.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.857 align:middle line:84%
You kind of-- the
Enneagram, in a way,

00:24:16.857 --> 00:24:18.940 align:middle line:84%
gives you a chance to look
through the personality

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.030 align:middle line:84%
to the soul and the
struggle of the soul

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:25.940 align:middle line:84%
to just emerge
through that story.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.450 align:middle line:84%
But once we can start
to trust that piece,

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:33.370 align:middle line:84%
we don't take our
personality as personally.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And the word I use for
it, and other people do,

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.680 align:middle line:84%
we're not grasping as
hard under our story.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.230 align:middle line:84%
For a one, I say,
well, we have to do--

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.550 align:middle line:90%
I have to do things right.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like my survival
depends upon this.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I don't know
what's going to happen.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's a
declarative statement.

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.670 align:middle line:90%
I have to do this.

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:55.720 align:middle line:84%
What you add to that exclamation
point is a question mark

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and say, I have to
do this this way.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:01.698 align:middle line:90%
Well, don't I?

00:25:01.698 --> 00:25:03.340 align:middle line:90%
I never thought about that.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, don't I have to be totally
prepared for this interview

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and make sure I answer
every question correctly?

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.430 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I don't.

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I could be present.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, our story keeps
us away from being present.

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.700 align:middle line:90%
We don't trust the moment.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's interesting
because that's what I do.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:26.610 align:middle line:84%
I overprepare, and it's
my security blanket.

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: It helps.

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then when
I show up, I may not--

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:84%
we may not use the
script at all, or we may.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.730 align:middle line:90%
But I tend to overprepare.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And I have people say all
the time, why do you do that?

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: So you can be present.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So I can be present.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Because then it's all done.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.340 align:middle line:90%
It's on paper.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.860 align:middle line:84%
If something falters, or
if someone blanks out,

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.550 align:middle line:90%
I've got something to refer to.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.350 align:middle line:90%
But it--

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yeah.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.800 align:middle line:90%
To me--

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --requires
a lot of work.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: We're all trying to
work towards being present.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And once you see
yourself through the lens

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:58.722 align:middle line:84%
of the Enneagram, you recognize
that we would rather be right.

00:25:58.722 --> 00:25:59.930 align:middle line:90%
We would rather help someone.

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:01.070 align:middle line:90%
We would rather be wounded.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.750 align:middle line:90%
We would rather be in power.

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.650 align:middle line:84%
We grab on to that
aspect of personality

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:08.720 align:middle line:84%
because we don't trust
that we have enough

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.660 align:middle line:84%
in the present moment
that we will be cared for,

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.630 align:middle line:84%
or we will just have something
that will flow through us.

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.460 align:middle line:90%
And so we grab onto--

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.090 align:middle line:84%
so it's the grasping
that distinguishes

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.040 align:middle line:90%
our more expansive side.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:90%
I know you-- I think maybe--

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to go into
the expansive and contraction

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:25.520 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.870 align:middle line:90%
But you know what I want to do?

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to get to those
type combinations

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.770 align:middle line:84%
now so we can get an
idea of how they operate,

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.285 align:middle line:84%
then get into the expansive
contraction thing.

00:26:33.285 --> 00:26:34.160 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Go for it.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:35.300 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Does that work?

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:36.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.758 align:middle line:90%
So let's dive in now.

00:26:38.758 --> 00:26:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Because we've talked about the
one and what the one is about.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to
get into the others,

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.070 align:middle line:84%
but in combination
with each other.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.705 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to take
a three with a six.

00:26:47.705 --> 00:26:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Hmm.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.590 align:middle line:90%
That's a good one.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say why a
good one because if--

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.810 align:middle line:90%
the Enneagram is a map.

00:26:56.810 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And I talked about the
triangle, and there's lines

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.170 align:middle line:90%
that connect different types.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And the three and
the six are connected

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.510 align:middle line:84%
by a line, the horizontal line
at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.420 align:middle line:84%
So I have found that
there's a lot to be learned

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes a lot of
blood under the bridge

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:17.570 align:middle line:90%
between these types.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Here's the essential
assumption of a three.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Life is about
getting things done.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Life is about finding
out what the world wants

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.880 align:middle line:90%
and providing that to the world.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Life is about being
noticed for achievements.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Life is about I'm OK
being in the limelight.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:38.390 align:middle line:84%
I want to get things
done efficiently.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.760 align:middle line:84%
If it's done perfectly, it's
not that important to me.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.730 align:middle line:84%
That would be some
trouble with a one.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:45.568 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Well, a one--

00:27:45.568 --> 00:27:46.610 align:middle line:90%
that's a whole other one.

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:48.560 align:middle line:90%
The six, it can be similar.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Because the six is looking out
for others in a certain way.

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:56.270 align:middle line:84%
But like a one, there's a
certain ethical standard

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.200 align:middle line:90%
that sixes have.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
does a six embody?

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Six is--

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:04.400 align:middle line:90%
I call them the guardians.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.950 align:middle line:84%
They tend to watch
out-- they don't quite

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:10.350 align:middle line:84%
trust that appearances
are what they are.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.320 align:middle line:90%
So a six looking into three--

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.480 align:middle line:90%
big-time skeptic.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.700 align:middle line:84%
They can see through
the three's facade.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Because threes are
OK with a facade.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So are three's good
with expediency, for example?

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And a six might say, that's not
really being covered properly?

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Exactly.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.590 align:middle line:84%
I think I gave an
example in the book.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.630 align:middle line:90%
The six is working for a three.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.760 align:middle line:84%
The six might see
all the things--

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.710 align:middle line:84%
there could be ethical
problems coming around,

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.200 align:middle line:84%
or problems we hadn't thought
about that could hit us.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.295 align:middle line:84%
It could wipe us out as
a company or something.

00:28:38.295 --> 00:28:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And the three is just
kind of, move it.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just get her done.

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:41.365 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Get it done.

00:28:41.365 --> 00:28:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And the six is
saying, wait a minute.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:47.840 align:middle line:84%
So a three can feel like the
six is dragging things down.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And the six will say,
but listen, really.

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Because sixes sometimes
get overlooked

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:57.890 align:middle line:84%
because it's like they kind
of have this antenna radar

00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:59.930 align:middle line:84%
to sense when things
could go wrong.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And they want to prevent
that from happening.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.310 align:middle line:90%
So actually, a wonderful ally--

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:07.290 align:middle line:84%
you want to have a good
six on your team to say,

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:08.690 align:middle line:90%
have you thought about this?

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:10.760 align:middle line:90%
What about contingency planning?

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.460 align:middle line:84%
What about this and this
and this could go wrong?

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And the three is
like, eh, you know.

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So there's a tension
between the two.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:84%
What happens, especially if
people get to know their types,

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.787 align:middle line:90%
they're not in conflict anymore.

00:29:23.787 --> 00:29:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so in this
case, the six is the employee

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:26.950 align:middle line:90%
of the three--

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:27.860 align:middle line:90%
is under the three.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yeah.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, if it's the other
way, the six will--

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.920 align:middle line:84%
well, sometimes sixes have a
difficult time in leadership

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.800 align:middle line:84%
because it's hard for
them to trust themselves,

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and they don't trust
other people as well.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:39.750 align:middle line:90%
Trust is a factor.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Trust.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.983 align:middle line:84%
They don't know that
they know enough,

00:29:41.983 --> 00:29:44.600 align:middle line:90%
or they have self-doubt.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and they
can do it either

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:50.340 align:middle line:84%
by kind of falling back
into doubt or the opposite.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.870 align:middle line:84%
It called counterphobic
six, where full speed ahead.

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't care about
what's going to happen.

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:57.110 align:middle line:90%
It's like being reckless.

00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Because both are focused on what
they think is most important.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.410 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
nine types, they're

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:05.180 align:middle line:90%
kind of all around the circle.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And they're all looking
at the same thing,

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:09.080 align:middle line:90%
but from a different viewpoint.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.030 align:middle line:90%
We need the three.

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:12.800 align:middle line:90%
We need the six.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And if the six can
understand that we--

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:18.140 align:middle line:84%
if a six is not
friendly with a three,

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:21.290 align:middle line:84%
they kind of get stuck
in paralysis of wanting

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:22.575 align:middle line:90%
to overanalyze something.

00:30:22.575 --> 00:30:24.200 align:middle line:84%
We haven't thought
enough through this.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.060 align:middle line:84%
So threes get
frustrated with sixes

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.640 align:middle line:84%
if a six is in leadership
because they feel like they're

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.410 align:middle line:90%
not moving fast enough.

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:32.090 align:middle line:84%
We can't consider
all these things.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:33.800 align:middle line:90%
We really have to move ahead.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And so a six could feel more
anxious because of that,

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:40.590 align:middle line:90%
more stressed.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So the six really has to get
to know his or her self pretty

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:47.240 align:middle line:84%
well and know when they're
overdoing their skepticism

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.140 align:middle line:90%
and their doubt.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably a
key thing for every type.

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.290 align:middle line:84%
The thing that is our
strength when overdone

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:56.903 align:middle line:84%
becomes our weakness
or our vulnerability.

00:30:56.903 --> 00:30:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Key thing to know.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.685 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: A six's sense
of skepticism, concern--

00:31:00.685 --> 00:31:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Paralyzing.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:06.968 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: --wary,
overdone-- it's a mess.

00:31:06.968 --> 00:31:09.412 align:middle line:84%
If they can learn to
say, well, let me--

00:31:09.412 --> 00:31:11.120 align:middle line:84%
sixes, you have to do
your reality check.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Is that really going to happen?

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:14.730 align:middle line:90%
What are the probabilities?

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:16.610 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at this more openly.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Because each person--
each type gets fixated

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:22.260 align:middle line:90%
in the emotion behind it.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.590 align:middle line:84%
So a six says, if I don't
pay attention to this,

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure something bad
is going to happen.

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:30.170 align:middle line:84%
But if I do a little bit of
reality checking and someone

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:32.780 align:middle line:84%
helps them do that,
they go, well, OK.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:33.740 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:34.670 align:middle line:90%
Let's move ahead.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.070 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a lot
to unhinge them,

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.105 align:middle line:84%
you might say,
from that concern.

00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And from the number
three's point of view then?

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.910 align:middle line:84%
How do they resolve-- the
three and the six resolve?

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: They have to
appreciate one another.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
basically, you--

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That requires
maturity, and also

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:55.340 align:middle line:84%
some contemplative
experience with that person.

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Good leadership always
require some self-awareness.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And then also
begin to appreciate

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.005 align:middle line:84%
there's more than one
way to see something,

00:32:03.005 --> 00:32:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and there's where the
Enneagram is brilliant.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not a right or wrong.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:12.208 align:middle line:84%
And then we learn, how do I get
the best out of this person?

00:32:12.208 --> 00:32:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes really
where the Enneagram

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.770 align:middle line:90%
is extremely useful as well.

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:19.048 align:middle line:84%
How do I see their high
qualities there and use those?

00:32:19.048 --> 00:32:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I would
think the compassion.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Because you might see a
type in operation thinking,

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.152 align:middle line:90%
I don't relate at all.

00:32:25.152 --> 00:32:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're just trying
to hog the limelight,

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:29.270 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is that
you're seeing that you

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:30.500 align:middle line:90%
don't like in your judging.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.380 align:middle line:84%
But also understand
that's your wound

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.250 align:middle line:90%
speaking to perhaps their wound.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.050 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yes.

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:36.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:38.000 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.850 align:middle line:90%
It does come down to compassion.

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think we
can really get there

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:46.670 align:middle line:84%
unless we have gone into the
wounding of our own type,

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and we feel how
difficult the struggle

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.740 align:middle line:90%
is to not always go that way.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Because these are
tied-in, deep places

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:57.363 align:middle line:84%
of these kind of mental,
emotional patterns that got

00:32:57.363 --> 00:32:59.030 align:middle line:84%
set a long time--
they're in our bodies.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:32:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, gosh.

00:32:59.210 --> 00:32:59.900 align:middle line:90%
They're our bodies.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:00.740 align:middle line:90%
They're in our DNA.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:01.970 align:middle line:90%
They're ancestral.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:03.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.220 align:middle line:90%
So ready to go to the next one?

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Sure.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Put a
five with a seven.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Again,
the lines connect

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.850 align:middle line:90%
between the five and the seven.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:18.130 align:middle line:84%
So fives tend to kind of
hold their energy in--

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:20.440 align:middle line:84%
the sin it's called,
the passion is avarice,

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.440 align:middle line:84%
meaning not that
they're cheap, but they

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.420 align:middle line:84%
feel there's not enough
energy to go around,

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:26.710 align:middle line:90%
so I have to kind of contain.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:28.900 align:middle line:84%
I want to use that to go
deeper into something.

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:29.903 align:middle line:90%
It's a mental type.

00:33:29.903 --> 00:33:30.820 align:middle line:90%
They love to research.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.653 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they might
feel more closed off

00:33:32.653 --> 00:33:34.480 align:middle line:90%
or isolated or introverted?

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: They choose that.

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:36.495 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:33:36.495 --> 00:33:38.745 align:middle line:84%
And so we're perceiving it,
but they're choosing that.

00:33:38.745 --> 00:33:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Well, that's their--
that is their strategy.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Because what their fear
is I will be overwhelmed

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:46.670 align:middle line:90%
by people's emotional needs.

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:48.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't have time for this.

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:51.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing something important,
and I'm doing something deep.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:53.570 align:middle line:84%
I want to put all of
my intention in that.

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:55.510 align:middle line:90%
Please don't distract me.

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they can be extroverted
as well, not that they're all

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.080 align:middle line:90%
closed down.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.620 align:middle line:84%
But they want to kind of
methodically figure things out.

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Sevens have almost
the opposite energy.

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where's the party?

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Let's plan
the next thing.

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And if five is saying no,
we haven't even done this.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.520 align:middle line:90%
So you can feel that tension.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.400 align:middle line:84%
The plus for each one, and
how they can help each other,

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.510 align:middle line:84%
is the seven can really help the
five be a little more playful

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy things before all the
study is done, you might say.

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But are the fives
usually resistant to that?

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:29.507 align:middle line:90%
Or can you draw them out?

00:34:29.507 --> 00:34:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: It depends.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Anyone feeling safe and loved
can alter their behavior.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.784 align:middle line:84%
If you come at a five and
saying, get out of yourself.

00:34:38.784 --> 00:34:40.159 align:middle line:84%
You're in your
head all the time.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:41.170 align:middle line:90%
It's not a great--

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:42.199 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not good.

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:43.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not a good strategy.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.133 align:middle line:84%
So what would you say to that
five to have them come out

00:34:46.133 --> 00:34:47.050 align:middle line:90%
and have a little fun?

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yeah.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.520 align:middle line:84%
You may have to seduce
them a bit in having fun,

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.320 align:middle line:84%
to almost come to
the dance floor

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and bring them-- pick
them up, grab their hand.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.768 align:middle line:90%
And once fives--

00:34:57.768 --> 00:34:59.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not all fives--
not that they're not fun.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:01.227 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
really fun fives.

00:35:01.227 --> 00:35:03.352 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wave the hors
d'oeuvres under their nose,

00:35:03.352 --> 00:35:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and then go pass
on to the other.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yes.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:06.740 align:middle line:90%
Life is not so bad.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Taste this.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.510 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like that,
to kind of take them out.

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:12.760 align:middle line:90%
And the five with the seven--

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.210 align:middle line:84%
it's pretty hard sell
for a five to say

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:19.730 align:middle line:84%
just quiet down a little bit,
or let's look a little deeper

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:20.530 align:middle line:90%
at something.

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:22.615 align:middle line:84%
Because the five gets
restless with that.

00:35:22.615 --> 00:35:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
seven isn't necessarily

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.350 align:middle line:84%
inclined in that
same way, right?

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:27.910 align:middle line:90%
They want-- they're more--

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:29.350 align:middle line:84%
they want to be
out in the world.

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:30.725 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
to miss anything.

00:35:30.725 --> 00:35:33.350 align:middle line:84%
They want to taste
everything, do everything.

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's not a really
super easy match.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: No.

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:40.790 align:middle line:84%
But it can-- it's
not super easy.

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:45.924 align:middle line:84%
But it can work-- and in the
Enneagram theory for the seven,

00:35:45.924 --> 00:35:48.190 align:middle line:84%
one area of
development for them is

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:51.190 align:middle line:84%
to understand their
own inner five.

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is the wonderful
thing about relationships.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.680 align:middle line:84%
If you-- if a seven
can recognize-- you

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.050 align:middle line:84%
see, what happens, we
project all that on a five

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:03.080 align:middle line:84%
to say, as a seven would, too
much thinking, too much going

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:03.880 align:middle line:90%
on there.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.320 align:middle line:90%
Just lighten up.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But if the seven
begins to recognize

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.800 align:middle line:84%
the value of going in
sometimes-- because the seven's

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.180 align:middle line:90%
energy is always going out.

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.940 align:middle line:90%
And see, if they can feel like--

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:20.080 align:middle line:84%
if they can calm themselves
from the understanding

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.480 align:middle line:84%
that there's a party
happening over there,

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and you're not going
to be included.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.450 align:middle line:84%
You're not going because
you've got to drill down

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:27.250 align:middle line:90%
a little bit into--

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:28.780 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's for
work or something--

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:32.150 align:middle line:84%
that it's OK to not be part
of everything all the time.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yes.

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's where
sevens mature, you see?

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And so the value I see
in knowing your own type

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:44.440 align:middle line:84%
is that in getting to
know the other types,

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:48.460 align:middle line:84%
then you start with
the types next to you.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:52.270 align:middle line:84%
For the seven, it's
the eight and the six

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:54.490 align:middle line:84%
and the lines that
connect for you.

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:58.900 align:middle line:84%
For the seven, it's
the five and the one.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:02.560 align:middle line:84%
For the five, it's the
seven and the eight.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:06.310 align:middle line:84%
So people-- the fives
tend to be maybe

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:84%
a little leery around
eights, for example.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.660 align:middle line:90%
But that's part of them.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Because fives can
use their eight--

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:15.670 align:middle line:84%
I call those things
kind of lifelines.

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:19.480 align:middle line:84%
In other words, each type
has its great gift, but also

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.010 align:middle line:90%
its narrowness.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And we all need to fill out
the missing pieces by saying,

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:27.572 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm stuck in my five.

00:37:27.572 --> 00:37:28.780 align:middle line:90%
What will get me out of this?

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:29.740 align:middle line:90%
Eight.

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And when a five uses eight,
they become more forthcoming.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.570 align:middle line:90%
They become more in command.

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:37.390 align:middle line:84%
They don't wait around to figure
out they need to learn more.

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:38.190 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.315 align:middle line:90%
Just take action right now.

00:37:39.315 --> 00:37:40.773 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't
wait to be invited.

00:37:40.773 --> 00:37:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yes.

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can see fives
get very aggressive.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:45.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, interesting.

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:47.202 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Especially if
they know something,

00:37:47.202 --> 00:37:48.280 align:middle line:90%
which they do know a lot.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Because they take a
lot of time to learn.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And then the seven
for them can be uncomfortable.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.050 align:middle line:84%
But, again, it's
like, OK, what--

00:37:56.050 --> 00:38:00.167 align:middle line:84%
that's another part of me over
there that can enjoy life.

00:38:00.167 --> 00:38:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the
two and the eight.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.900 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure we have time
for each of these and two more

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:05.170 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Well, it's
interesting, because you're

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.930 align:middle line:84%
picking all the ones where
the lines do connect.

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.130 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:11.088 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And you intuitively
kind of knew that.

00:38:11.088 --> 00:38:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And my theory
about it is that we

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:17.110 align:middle line:84%
tend to have the most
significant relationships

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:20.410 align:middle line:84%
with people with
whom we share a line.

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And we battle it
out, or we learn.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:25.420 align:middle line:84%
The two and the
eight-- so the two

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.570 align:middle line:84%
tends to be focused on
others and on making sure

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:30.700 align:middle line:84%
that people have a
positive experience, that I

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.140 align:middle line:90%
can help make you happy.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I can provide something that
will bring good feelings.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:35.740 align:middle line:90%
Me--

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nurturing.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: I don't know.

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:37.870 align:middle line:90%
Nurturing, yeah.

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:39.490 align:middle line:90%
The eights are not nurturers.

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:42.670 align:middle line:84%
That's just not on their radar,
not that they don't care.

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:44.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's like they just
go, what has to be done?

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:45.710 align:middle line:90%
Let's go do it.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And if someone gets knocked
out of the way on the way,

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, but I'm just
asserting the power--

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:50.582 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Had to be done.

00:38:50.582 --> 00:38:52.068 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Had to be done.

00:38:52.068 --> 00:38:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those would seem
almost polar opposite.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yes.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a classic
relationship there.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, I always say
when I coupled--

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:02.590 align:middle line:90%
when I worked with couples--

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:04.120 align:middle line:84%
let's say it was a
two and an eight.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.830 align:middle line:90%
I would say, here's the line.

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:09.190 align:middle line:84%
You both are kind of polar
opposites here in certain ways.

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:13.660 align:middle line:84%
If you, two, would move an
inch closer to the eight,

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and you, eight, would move
an inch closer to the two,

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:19.670 align:middle line:84%
you'll have a better chance
of understanding one another.

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So for the two, two do you
need to assert yourself

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:24.160 align:middle line:90%
a little more sometimes?

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Two, do you need to
recognize that you

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:27.730 align:middle line:90%
have some power as well?

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Twos tend to go to eights
when they're trapped,

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:34.270 align:middle line:84%
when they don't know what
else to do because they're

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:36.940 align:middle line:84%
angry that someone
didn't appreciate them,

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.380 align:middle line:90%
and then they're in your face.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And people get surprised by
this very supportive, sweet two.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They go into
passive-aggressive stuff.

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Well, no.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.440 align:middle line:90%
Aggressive.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Aggressive.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.060 align:middle line:90%
Oh, all right.

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.920 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: In your face.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.630 align:middle line:84%
The eight-- just taking
care of business.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:53.560 align:middle line:90%
Don't think about it.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nothing personal.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:55.513 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Nothing personal.

00:39:55.513 --> 00:39:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So for the eight, that one
inch of movement is to say,

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:02.560 align:middle line:84%
hmm, I wonder how this
affects someone I care about.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'm always blustery.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And also eights tend to
overindulge in things.

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:13.837 align:middle line:84%
They do too much of whatever it
is literally-- food, sex, life.

00:40:13.837 --> 00:40:14.920 align:middle line:90%
It's like we got to just--

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're gobbling
it up with the big spoon.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yeah.

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.360 align:middle line:90%
But what does this do to others?

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So bottom
line, would you

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.880 align:middle line:84%
say on a relative
scale percentagewise

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.850 align:middle line:84%
that might have a higher
percentage of divorce, to it?

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:29.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Well, it could.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.490 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're always--

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm asking because
if we know these things, if we

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:38.680 align:middle line:84%
know ourselves, if our
partner knows themselves,

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.560 align:middle line:84%
or our potential friend or
partner know themselves a bit,

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and you use the Enneagram
as a lens, not a box,

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:47.290 align:middle line:84%
you could avoid-- say, hey,
we could be great friends,

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:49.582 align:middle line:84%
but it probably wouldn't be
good to be in a tight space

00:40:49.582 --> 00:40:50.530 align:middle line:90%
together every day.

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Well, it's possible.

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:53.820 align:middle line:84%
I think once people
learn the Enneagram,

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:56.330 align:middle line:90%
at first they might go, oh, man.

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:59.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm this and you're that?

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.580 align:middle line:90%
And I can look--

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:03.910 align:middle line:84%
any type can get
along with another.

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.340 align:middle line:90%
Some are more challenging.

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:09.550 align:middle line:84%
But, again, it comes
back to how willing

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.080 align:middle line:84%
you are to soften the
edges of your type.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Just two more questions because
we're almost out of time.

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:19.210 align:middle line:84%
So I want to go back to that
expansion and contraction

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:23.020 align:middle line:84%
issue within us, as
whatever our type is.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to ask you
another question on the heels

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:29.620 align:middle line:84%
of it, which is, do we change
types as we mature and go

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:30.825 align:middle line:90%
through phases of our life?

00:41:30.825 --> 00:41:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK:
Expansion-contraction is

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.670 align:middle line:90%
the language I use around this.

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Other people talk about
levels of development.

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:41.860 align:middle line:84%
But my way to say it
is, what type you are,

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:45.700 align:middle line:84%
or what type you live in,
is not as important as where

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.878 align:middle line:90%
you live in your type.

00:41:47.878 --> 00:41:50.170 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we could live
in our more narrow, where

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:53.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm fixated on my beliefs.

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:56.030 align:middle line:84%
If it's an eight, I
have to stay in control.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:59.170 align:middle line:84%
I have to be in the power
of position no matter what.

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:00.460 align:middle line:90%
That's a narrow side.

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's all held in by these
mental, emotional patterns

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:04.695 align:middle line:90%
that are unconscious.

00:42:04.695 --> 00:42:06.362 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So like you
said a minute ago,

00:42:06.362 --> 00:42:08.080 align:middle line:84%
if you have a two
and an eight, if they

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.490 align:middle line:84%
move toward each other,
that's expansion.

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yes.

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:15.395 align:middle line:84%
And it gives you your particular
path from your point of view.

00:42:15.395 --> 00:42:17.770 align:middle line:84%
We don't-- you can say, well,
we all on a path of growth.

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:18.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we are.

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:22.750 align:middle line:84%
But here's your specific--
your GPS points you this way.

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And so for the
eight what we do--

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:27.190 align:middle line:90%
the expansion starts this way.

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Eight, what would
your nine be like?

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:32.874 align:middle line:84%
Eight begins to mellow a
little bit with a nine.

00:42:32.874 --> 00:42:36.828 align:middle line:84%
Eight and the nine taking
him-- it's right next to you.

00:42:36.828 --> 00:42:38.120 align:middle line:90%
How about if you just see the--

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
nine is a peacemaker.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: How do I see that
there's many points of view,

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:42.330 align:middle line:90%
not just mine.

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:43.720 align:middle line:90%
It isn't my way or the highway.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.060 align:middle line:84%
The nine says, there are
a lot of highways, OK?

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:49.330 align:middle line:84%
The seven says,
lighten up a bit.

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:52.210 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy yourself, but come on.

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And then the line that
connects the eight to the two

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:57.250 align:middle line:90%
that says, think about others.

00:42:57.250 --> 00:43:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And the eight that connects
to the five, the other line,

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:04.540 align:middle line:84%
it says sometimes go in a
little bit and analyze before.

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Because eights tend
to act and then think.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:08.630 align:middle line:90%
They're very impulsive.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.330 align:middle line:84%
The five really thinks
through something

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:12.140 align:middle line:90%
before they take an action.

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.950 align:middle line:90%
So there's the expansion.

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:17.495 align:middle line:84%
So again-- and once you
do that, already you've

00:43:17.495 --> 00:43:19.120 align:middle line:84%
got four other types
that are like you.

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.100 align:middle line:90%
No, it makes sense.

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.720 align:middle line:84%
It's just maturing and
expanding into potentials--

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.500 align:middle line:90%
that are your potentials.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.772 align:middle line:84%
So what about the notion of
changing throughout a lifetime?

00:43:27.772 --> 00:43:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: I would
call it prevailing

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:31.750 align:middle line:84%
theory is that we don't
necessarily change our type,

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:33.280 align:middle line:90%
but we grow on our type.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.903 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe
what we do is expand

00:43:34.903 --> 00:43:36.820 align:middle line:84%
into all these other
relative types within it.

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: We'll learn that
it's not that I am an eight.

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I see life through
this lens only.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.370 align:middle line:90%
What else can I do?

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:46.420 align:middle line:10%
And another really
key thing in the types

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.950 align:middle line:10%
is called subtypes, which
we don't talk about here.

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:53.200 align:middle line:84%
But we do sometimes move
through those in our life,

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.880 align:middle line:90%
depending on circumstances.

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.010 align:middle line:10%
So you might be
operating as a four

00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:58.683 align:middle line:10%
in your one-on-one
subtype, which

00:43:58.683 --> 00:44:00.850 align:middle line:10%
is going to look different
from your social subtype,

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:02.660 align:middle line:10%
and different stages of
life will require that.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, like if you're
going through a long period

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:06.250 align:middle line:84%
of grief, for example,
that might switch--

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:08.320 align:middle line:84%
that might shift
your subtype too.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: I've seen people
identify themselves as fours

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:12.220 align:middle line:90%
when they are in grief.

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:13.970 align:middle line:90%
So there's an overlay of that.

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But generally, we don't
really, that I can see,

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:18.640 align:middle line:90%
change our type.

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.990 align:middle line:90%
We get more like our type.

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:22.913 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And also, we
get less like our type--

00:44:22.913 --> 00:44:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: --where we're
not as identified with it.

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:28.990 align:middle line:90%
It's like we're more than that.

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:31.523 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Enneagram
invites us to do.

00:44:31.523 --> 00:44:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so beautiful.

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And you're so-- I love
the fact that you just

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:35.645 align:middle line:90%
love the Enneagram.

00:44:35.645 --> 00:44:36.520 align:middle line:90%
You're so good at it.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.170 align:middle line:90%
You're so passionate about it.

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And your passion
comes through and gets

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.780 align:middle line:84%
everybody excited to jump
on it and try to find out

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:44.650 align:middle line:90%
what's going on.

00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: I hope so.

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:46.435 align:middle line:84%
This is the best thing
that's come along.

00:44:46.435 --> 00:44:46.855 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:44:46.855 --> 00:44:47.690 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:48.490 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:50.368 align:middle line:84%
Well, Frank, thanks
again for taking the time

00:44:50.368 --> 00:44:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and congratulations
on your new book.

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:53.368 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Thanks
for having me back.

00:44:53.368 --> 00:44:54.520 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, the
title of the book

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:59.020 align:middle line:84%
is "A Field Guide to
Humans," by Frank De Luca.

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:00.940 align:middle line:10%
If you enjoyed this
conversation, by the way,

you might also enjoy my
previous conversation with Frank
