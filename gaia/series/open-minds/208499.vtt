>>KAYLA OSTERHOFF: I
ended up in the field

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.840 align:middle line:90%
of neuropsychophysiology.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.880 align:middle line:84%
There are actually
many differences

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.830 align:middle line:84%
in how the brain functions and
operates between men and women.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.430 align:middle line:84%
The way that our societies
are set up actually

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.580 align:middle line:90%
work against the female biology.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.190 align:middle line:84%
It eventually leads
women to burn out.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Women's biology
follows a cyclic nature

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.110 align:middle line:84%
because of the influence
of their menstrual--

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.700 align:middle line:90%
their ovarian hormones.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Women are psychologically
programmed to think

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:84%
for the collective,
and so you could

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.520 align:middle line:84%
say that the female brain is
actually wired for leadership.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Women are the greatest
untapped resource

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.940 align:middle line:84%
that modern society
has access to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.340 align:middle line:84%
in order to create massive
global change and evolution.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.523 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.523 --> 00:01:11.190 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
It's decades overdue,

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle line:10%
but the world of
neuropsychology is finally

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.330 align:middle line:10%
studying the unique
characteristics

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.040 align:middle line:10%
of the male and female brains.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
we're totally different.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.480 align:middle line:84%
First off, the female brain
is wired for leadership.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.200 align:middle line:84%
So why aren't we in more
positions of leadership?

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Kayla Osterhoff has
spent years researching

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.790 align:middle line:84%
in this field of
gender neurobiology

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.920 align:middle line:84%
and has come to some
profound discoveries.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.940 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Kayla.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.795 align:middle line:90%
We meet again.

00:01:33.795 --> 00:01:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.807 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm so happy
to have you here.

00:01:35.807 --> 00:01:39.420 align:middle line:84%
The last interview I did
with you got such a response

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:84%
from women, because
they'd never heard this

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.040 align:middle line:90%
reflected back about themselves.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was very heavy
female response on this.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, let--
get into a little bit

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.710 align:middle line:84%
of your own background and how
you ended up in this field.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to get into
the history of why women were

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:84%
never even included
in most studies,

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.440 align:middle line:84%
including pharmaceutical
studies and so forth, yet we're

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:84%
having to contend with whatever
the outcome of studies tailored

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.120 align:middle line:90%
for men are.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.810 align:middle line:90%
So tell us about you first.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for having me on.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.780 align:middle line:10%
I am so excited for
this conversation,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.790 align:middle line:10%
and it's not surprising that we
had a big response from women

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.232 align:middle line:10%
and, I noticed, a
nice response from men

00:02:23.232 --> 00:02:25.815 align:middle line:10%
as well, just saying, wow, I've
never heard this information--

00:02:25.815 --> 00:02:26.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.730 align:middle line:10%
>>OSTERHOFF: --before.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.390 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.932 align:middle line:10%
>>OSTERHOFF: And
it's not surprising,

00:02:28.932 --> 00:02:32.760 align:middle line:10%
because this information isn't
widely publicly available.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.690 align:middle line:10%
And hopefully, our talks
and interviews like this

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.278 align:middle line:10%
can start to shift that.

00:02:38.278 --> 00:02:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's really critical.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: It actually is.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how did you
end up in this field?

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah, so
I ended up in the field

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.150 align:middle line:84%
of neuropsychophysiology,
because I am just

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.450 align:middle line:84%
fascinated by human behavior
and what drives human behavior.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I've studied the health
sciences my entire life.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.610 align:middle line:84%
I studied in my
undergrad health ecology

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and actually was on track
to work in physical therapy.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.060 align:middle line:84%
But along that way, I
actually had some experiences

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.660 align:middle line:84%
with my own family in
the medical systems

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.750 align:middle line:84%
that shifted me to
become interested

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.140 align:middle line:84%
in public health and public
health policy and public health

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.170 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:84%
So I went on to get my master's
degree in public health.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to work for
the Centers for Disease Control

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:84%
and Prevention for several
years as a health scientist,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and all along the way,
I've had this fascination

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.160 align:middle line:84%
about what drives
human behavior and also

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.730 align:middle line:84%
how our biological and
neurological processes work.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And so now, I'm pursuing
my doctoral degree

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.610 align:middle line:84%
in the field of
neuropsychophysiology, which

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.400 align:middle line:84%
is the field of
mind-body medicine

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.570 align:middle line:84%
or the mind-body interaction and
the interaction, specifically,

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.340 align:middle line:90%
between the brain and the mind.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and our connection
was Katrine Volynsky, who

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:90%
I've had on this show before.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And she's hardcore
on the science part,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.010 align:middle line:84%
and she said, you have
to interview Kayla,

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.850 align:middle line:84%
because you're doing
breakthrough work.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So with that said, now let's
go into the history of how

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:84%
women have been
excluded, historically,

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.394 align:middle line:90%
especially in the past--

00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:18.269 align:middle line:84%
a little different in
the last 20, 30 years--

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.910 align:middle line:90%
from trials and studies.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah,
so women actually

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.110 align:middle line:84%
represent the largest gap in
our health science research

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and understanding of
human biology, which

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.402 align:middle line:84%
is really kind of concerning,
and it's interesting.

00:04:34.402 --> 00:04:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's half
the people on the planet.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.527 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Exactly, right?

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:41.550 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about, actually,
51% of the population

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.890 align:middle line:84%
that is really not
well represented

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.850 align:middle line:84%
in the clinical research and
also greatly misunderstood.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And so this actually goes back
to the beginning of research,

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:84%
but this was solidified back
in 1977, when the FDA formally

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.760 align:middle line:84%
banned all women of
childbearing potential

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.100 align:middle line:90%
from all clinical research.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, this ban remained
in effect until 1993,

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.630 align:middle line:90%
when it was overturned.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: And even
since then, the damage

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:84%
has been done, and to this
day, surprisingly, shockingly,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.840 align:middle line:84%
women are still very
underrepresented

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:90%
in our scientific research.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is because of a
couple of really good reasons,

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.010 align:middle line:90%
though it doesn't make it right.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.488 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: But
one of the reasons

00:05:28.488 --> 00:05:32.730 align:middle line:84%
is that women are risky
research subjects.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is
that women can potentially

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.800 align:middle line:90%
become pregnant at any time.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And so for safety,
researchers leave

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.940 align:middle line:84%
women out of research
because of that potential

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.220 align:middle line:84%
that they could become
pregnant during the study.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, this is women
of childbearing potential.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.640 align:middle line:84%
But that's still
a large age group.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, yes.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.280 align:middle line:84%
It's still the
majority of women.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And the other reason is that
women are difficult research

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:01.560 align:middle line:90%
subjects.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is
that we are biochemically

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and neurochemically
changing consistently

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.440 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
course of a month.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.615 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: This
is not the case

00:06:12.615 --> 00:06:15.110 align:middle line:84%
with our male counterparts,
who are consistently

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.450 align:middle line:90%
the same day in and day out.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 24-hour
cycle hormonally.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.500 align:middle line:84%
In a little bit, we're
going to break down

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.550 align:middle line:84%
those cycles of the
female on a 28-day basis

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.360 align:middle line:84%
and see where the potential lies
for us to really, as you call

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.280 align:middle line:90%
them, develop our superpowers.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So before we go
into all of that,

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.710 align:middle line:84%
you and I were joking
before about I said to you,

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:84%
can you fathom what
in the world it

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.670 align:middle line:84%
would take to have a group
of women in an encampment,

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.090 align:middle line:84%
living in horrid conditions,
waiting for the crack of dawn

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and on orders from
their commander,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.680 align:middle line:90%
run into opposing bayonets?

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.740 align:middle line:84%
I can't fathom any
circumstance in which

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.770 align:middle line:84%
you would find a group of
women doing that, right?

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, and so we were joking
about this, because there's

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.620 align:middle line:84%
a reason that men
can do that and do

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.350 align:middle line:84%
do that and that women probably
would likely never do that.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's just go
there to begin with,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.030 align:middle line:84%
because I love the
story of consequence.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, and thank you
for bringing up consequence.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:20.540 align:middle line:84%
This is so important when we're
talking about human psychology

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and exactly what you're talking
about-- these differences

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:84%
between men and women
psychologically.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:84%
When we're looking
at women and we're

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.530 align:middle line:84%
looking at women's
psychology, we

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.840 align:middle line:84%
see a couple of
differences in the way

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.270 align:middle line:90%
that we mentally operate, right?

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, women
have been regarded

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.980 align:middle line:84%
as emotional and as leading
with our hearts instead

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.300 align:middle line:90%
of their minds maybe.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's not necessarily
accurate, but what is happening

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.950 align:middle line:84%
is that women are
psychologically

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.930 align:middle line:84%
programmed to think
for the collective.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is, passed down

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.040 align:middle line:84%
through generations and
generations of women who

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.320 align:middle line:90%
have been in caretaker roles--

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.950 align:middle line:84%
right, so this is passed
down epigenetically

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:14.590 align:middle line:84%
through generations of women,
the ability to think for others

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:18.575 align:middle line:84%
or think about the impact of our
behaviors on those around us.

00:08:18.575 --> 00:08:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it
makes perfect sense.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.870 align:middle line:84%
As moms, you want to make
sure your kids grow up

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and make it into
adulthood and your parents

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.630 align:middle line:84%
and so forth and just
make-- this is the way we've

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.740 align:middle line:90%
evolved for a purpose.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Someone has to be
taking care of the kids,

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and someone has to
be testing the edges.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, exactly.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.669 align:middle line:84%
And so this is actually
one of our superpowers

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:41.770 align:middle line:90%
for leadership as women.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Because we are
constantly concerned

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:49.640 align:middle line:84%
about how our actions
impact those around us,

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.440 align:middle line:84%
we make decisions
for the collective

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.610 align:middle line:84%
or thinking about the impact
on the greater collective.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So when you think about
that in a leadership role,

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.420 align:middle line:84%
that's actually a
great quality to have.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One would think
an essential quality.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, yeah.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, the way
we've been set up historically

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.263 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the church
and patriarchal times--

00:09:13.263 --> 00:09:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and we go through
waves when we've

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.890 align:middle line:84%
come-- we're just now emerging
from a very heavy period

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:84%
of patriarchy for
thousands of years,

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.350 align:middle line:84%
where the men have become
in control and dominant.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.680 align:middle line:84%
This whole notion of consequence
has been thrown aside,

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and what we see is
just perpetual war,

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.320 align:middle line:84%
grabbing other people's
stuff and trying

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.630 align:middle line:84%
to claim it as your own, as
your own territory and so forth.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to
hear both sides--

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.230 align:middle line:84%
why this comes more naturally
to men to do it that way

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:45.075 align:middle line:84%
and why the women would
respond in the opposite manner.

00:09:45.075 --> 00:09:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah,
so when you're

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.900 align:middle line:84%
looking at the neurology
of men and women,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:90%
there's many differences.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.480 align:middle line:84%
But one really interesting
one that impacts our behavior

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and what drives our
behavior and the differences

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.780 align:middle line:84%
between men and women are
specific neurotransmitters,

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.830 align:middle line:84%
so neurochemicals that
impact our behavior

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and regulate our
neurological function.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So when we're looking at
our male counterparts,

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.950 align:middle line:84%
their master
neuroregulator, that kind of

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.020 align:middle line:84%
sets the pace for
everything else

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.865 align:middle line:84%
and keeps everything
in order, is dopamine.

00:10:19.865 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Go, go, go.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Dopamine is our reward
chemical of the brain,

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and so if you think
about-- look at,

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.410 align:middle line:84%
in society, not only with
war and things like that,

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.740 align:middle line:84%
but if you just look
at the constructs

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and environments
and infrastructures

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:39.340 align:middle line:84%
that we have in our society,
they are very dopamine-driven,

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.370 align:middle line:84%
meaning that our society
is set up in such a way

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:84%
that we are getting
constant hits of dopamine.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Making achievements or
checking things off to-do list

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.080 align:middle line:84%
or getting rewards and
recognition and accolades,

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:57.090 align:middle line:84%
things like that are little hits
of dopamine that can happen,

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.212 align:middle line:90%
right, throughout the day.

00:10:58.212 --> 00:11:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
getting that reinforcement,

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and you have adrenaline feeding
into it if it's a high risk

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:02.725 align:middle line:90%
situation--

00:11:02.725 --> 00:11:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --for example.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one
of the studies,

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.590 align:middle line:84%
a million-plus people globally,
MRIs of male and female

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.390 align:middle line:90%
brains--

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.390 align:middle line:84%
that center that takes
consequence into consideration

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:17.050 align:middle line:84%
isn't as well lit up in
men as it is with women.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, so
there are actually

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.320 align:middle line:84%
many differences in how the
brain functions and operates

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:90%
between men and women.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And so going back to that
master neuro regulator,

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:84%
the interesting thing about that
is, for women, our master neuro

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:90%
regulator is not dopamine.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.330 align:middle line:90%
It's oxytocin.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.065 align:middle line:90%
And you know what oxytocin is?

00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: It's given the
nickname, "the cuddle hormone,"

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:42.440 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: That's--

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The connection--
the mother and baby.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:45.960 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: It's
about connection, yes.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So in order for women to
operate neurologically

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.760 align:middle line:84%
at an optimal level,
they need to have

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.060 align:middle line:90%
healthy levels of oxytocin.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you really think about
that, think about society

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.030 align:middle line:84%
and the women out there
working in the workforce

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.870 align:middle line:84%
in this dopamine-dominant
kind of situation day in

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
and day out, they're getting
all these hits of dopamine,

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.850 align:middle line:84%
but maybe they're not
getting enough opportunities

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:14.750 align:middle line:90%
for oxytocin.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this has so
many implications.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Continue, and we'll
get into some of them.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And so the even more interesting
and maybe even devastating

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:30.220 align:middle line:84%
part about this is that
dopamine squelches oxytocin.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet in this
post-industrial world,

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.240 align:middle line:84%
all of our systems are set
up on that male model that

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.010 align:middle line:90%
produces dopamine.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.570 align:middle line:90%
This is devastating.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
I said in the open,

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.100 align:middle line:84%
why aren't women in more
leadership positions?

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.225 align:middle line:90%
Well, you have the obvious.

00:12:46.225 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you're
going into deep banking

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.310 align:middle line:84%
structures, good old boys
club, personal connections

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.080 align:middle line:90%
through society and so forth.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.260 align:middle line:90%
I get all that.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.000 align:middle line:84%
But as you keep descending
kind of from that level,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:84%
still, women aren't
represented properly yet

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:05.920 align:middle line:84%
in leadership capacities,
when we're naturally oriented

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.400 align:middle line:90%
to do that well.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that
and why it's not happening

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and why it probably
shouldn't even

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:84%
happen the way it's structured
right now in the workforce.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes,
you're exactly right.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And you know what we're talking
about is how women are really

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:25.510 align:middle line:84%
wired for leadership, though
we don't see this reflected

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.860 align:middle line:90%
in the statistics.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's in
between 18% and 20%

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.960 align:middle line:84%
of women in leadership roles
in positions across the United

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.900 align:middle line:84%
States, and why
isn't it more equal

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.650 align:middle line:90%
or even flipped the other way?

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: And that's
because of many things,

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.090 align:middle line:90%
as you mentioned.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:47.740 align:middle line:84%
But one major, major
piece goes back

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.630 align:middle line:84%
to this scientific gap, this
gender gap in our research.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Women are completely
misunderstood.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Women are not well represented
in the scientific literature

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:00.730 align:middle line:90%
and education.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So what this boils down to is
that, one, our environments

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and our infrastructures and
even expectations are set up

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:84%
to really work well
with male biology

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.410 align:middle line:84%
and the male
biorhythms, which we'll

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:84%
talk about in more
detail in a minute.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.590 align:middle line:84%
But it really aligns
well with what's

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.520 align:middle line:84%
going on with the male
body and is in alignment

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.790 align:middle line:90%
with the male biological needs.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.790 align:middle line:84%
But for women, we
really miss the mark.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's because we don't
have the same understanding

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:90%
about how women operate.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And what we're just now starting
to find out, or at least

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.760 align:middle line:84%
from the scientific
community perspective,

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:51.380 align:middle line:84%
is that women's biology
follows a cyclic nature,

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.380 align:middle line:84%
meaning that women, as
we mentioned before,

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.380 align:middle line:84%
are biochemically,
neurochemically,

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.010 align:middle line:84%
and physiologically
changing significantly

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.590 align:middle line:84%
throughout the course
of a month because

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:05.710 align:middle line:84%
of the influence of
their menstrual--

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.950 align:middle line:84%
their ovarian hormones
and their menstrual cycle.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, this has a global impact on
their body and how it operates.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And so what this
means is that women

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:24.810 align:middle line:84%
require different environments,
infrastructures, schedules,

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and even lifestyle
components to support

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.410 align:middle line:90%
their ever-changing biology.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, as women, we're never
given the operation manual

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.525 align:middle line:84%
for this feminine biology
that we've been gifted.

00:15:40.525 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I say "we've been
gifted," because it's

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:middle line:90%
so brilliantly designed.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.450 align:middle line:84%
But we were never given
the user's manual.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.497 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: So we're not
operating at our full capacity.

00:15:50.497 --> 00:15:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
you think of this,

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.660 align:middle line:84%
just getting down to
brass tacks, so to speak,

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.180 align:middle line:84%
you think about a
war room situation,

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:84%
where it's being with the
generals and the various people

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.368 align:middle line:84%
that consult or
in on the meeting,

00:16:03.368 --> 00:16:05.160 align:middle line:84%
and what's going to
happen, whether there's

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.740 align:middle line:84%
going to be aggressive action
taken or not and so forth.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, it seems to me
that that could only flow

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:12.450 align:middle line:90%
better if you had women in it.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe you wouldn't have
a war room to begin with.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:15.470 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you would.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:16.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.170 align:middle line:84%
But it seems it would
be natural for women

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.980 align:middle line:84%
to have a stake in that
game, a say in that game,

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.260 align:middle line:84%
because they're always
looking at the long term

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.600 align:middle line:84%
consequence and the
consequence for all,

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.130 align:middle line:90%
yet they're not in those rooms.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.170 align:middle line:84%
By and large, they're
not in those rooms.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
this to slam men,

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:84%
but you have the wrong
people at the helm,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.540 align:middle line:84%
particularly in
military situations.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.750 align:middle line:84%
But then the military
situations are there

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:42.870 align:middle line:84%
because we've been having
this dopamine-driven culture

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.050 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.830 align:middle line:84%
This is just kind of a
little dying remnant of it

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.010 align:middle line:90%
in a certain sense.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's go into what
happens with the guys that

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:55.260 align:middle line:84%
are in that war room, their
24-hour cycle and dopamine,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and how it actually,
for them, kind

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.100 align:middle line:84%
of works in this system
as it exists right now.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah, so as
I was mentioning before,

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:90%
that kind of a system--

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.589 align:middle line:84%
first of all, a
repeating daily system,

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:10.310 align:middle line:84%
which is how our society
is set up, but even kind

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:13.310 align:middle line:84%
of that high pressure
situation, where you're

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.349 align:middle line:84%
going to get lots
of hits of dopamine,

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:17.040 align:middle line:90%
works really well for men.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And so they really thrive
in that kind of a situation.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's like
football and spectator sports

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and getting jacked up
and even as a spectator,

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.339 align:middle line:90%
no less a participant.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:31.190 align:middle line:84%
That's really kind of critical
for that dopamine production.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, absolutely.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And so men are thriving in these
kinds of environments, which

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.900 align:middle line:84%
is wonderful,
because we absolutely

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.020 align:middle line:84%
need masculine
leadership in this world.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And the great thing is we
have a lot of representation

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:46.700 align:middle line:90%
of that already.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we need to
work on is representing

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:84%
feminine leadership
in this world.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.830 align:middle line:90%
And the two are necessary.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:55.820 align:middle line:90%
We need both.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: And
both need to marry

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:02.330 align:middle line:84%
so that we can shift and evolve
our culture and our society

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:84%
forward, which, as you
and I know and probably

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.895 align:middle line:84%
all the viewers know, we
need that now more than ever.

00:18:08.895 --> 00:18:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
24-hour cycle of men,

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.680 align:middle line:84%
and then go into the much
more complex cycle of women,

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.900 align:middle line:84%
and how would that
work in that situation?

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:23.360 align:middle line:84%
So the male biology,
as you mentioned,

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:28.170 align:middle line:84%
is set to the pace of what are
called the adrenal hormones.

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a daily
repeating 24-hour system,

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:35.420 align:middle line:84%
hormonal system, that
is driven by cortisol,

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:39.540 align:middle line:84%
our stress hormone, and
melatonin, our sleep hormone.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, these two
hormones influence

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and set the pace of the
greater male physiology

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.010 align:middle line:90%
and all biological processes.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So every day, day in and
day out, men are pretty much

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.190 align:middle line:90%
consistently the same.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we look
at our women, it's

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:middle line:90%
a very different situation.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we have those
same adrenal hormones.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:84%
We have cortisol and melatonin,
and we have a sleep wake cycle.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:12.440 align:middle line:84%
However, our biology and
our greater physiology

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.760 align:middle line:84%
across all systems are not set
to the pace of those hormones.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:84%
They are set to the pace of
two very different hormones

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:26.090 align:middle line:84%
that come from our ovaries, so
our ovarian hormones, estrogen

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.750 align:middle line:90%
and progesterone.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting thing is
that estrogen and progesterone

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:35.540 align:middle line:84%
is set to a monthly cycle,
meaning that these two

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.690 align:middle line:84%
important biochemicals
ebb and flow

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:40.610 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
course of the month.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So there are certain times
during our cycle, where

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.980 align:middle line:84%
we have higher
levels of estrogen,

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and there are
certain times we have

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:49.723 align:middle line:90%
higher levels of progesterone.

00:19:49.723 --> 00:19:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how
is that reflected

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.040 align:middle line:84%
in how we function in the
world and our capabilities?

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, so
what's really fascinating

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:84%
is when we look,
again, going back

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.510 align:middle line:84%
to those brain scans
of men and women

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and the differences, when we
look at the female brain, what

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:09.710 align:middle line:84%
we see is that there
are certain areas that

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:13.040 align:middle line:84%
have high densities of
estrogen and progesterone

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:18.320 align:middle line:84%
receptors, namely the prefrontal
cortex, the hippocampus,

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.208 align:middle line:90%
and the hypothalamus.

00:20:19.208 --> 00:20:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And explain what
each one is responsible for.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, now
these three areas,

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:84%
collectively, are responsible
for many leadership qualities,

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:84%
including discernment,
decision-making, mental acuity,

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:38.600 align:middle line:84%
emotional intelligence,
and memory consolidation,

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.530 align:middle line:90%
amongst other things as well.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.640 align:middle line:84%
But all of these qualities
are very, very vital

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:90%
for good leadership.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And so you could say that
the female brain is actually

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.210 align:middle line:90%
wired for leadership.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And now, going back
to that cyclic nature

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.487 align:middle line:90%
of those hormones--

00:20:57.487 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, because just
to interject for a moment,

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.310 align:middle line:84%
so from a woman's
point of view, you

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.935 align:middle line:84%
have periods of the month where
you're feeling highly energetic

00:21:03.935 --> 00:21:05.903 align:middle line:84%
highly creative, maybe
highly intuitive.

00:21:05.903 --> 00:21:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Then you feel like you're
on a slippery slope.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.470 align:middle line:90%
The energy is waning.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:12.390 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a lot of
energy or desire and so forth.

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what makes that happen,

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and how do we work
that into life?

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to talk about women

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.900 align:middle line:90%
leaving the workforce.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, so
this monthly cycle

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.620 align:middle line:84%
that we have that's driven by
those changes in those ovarian

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.920 align:middle line:84%
hormones impacts our
physiology at large.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And so not only does
this have an impact

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.190 align:middle line:84%
on our reproductive
system, but it

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.100 align:middle line:84%
has an impact on our
cardiovascular system,

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.280 align:middle line:84%
our respiratory system,
our neurological systems,

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:84%
our central and
peripheral nervous system,

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.940 align:middle line:84%
our metabolic function,
and literally everything.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And so our physiology
is changing so much

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.480 align:middle line:84%
over the course of a month,
that you could actually

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.080 align:middle line:84%
say that women are actually
four different people

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.910 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
course of a month,

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:05.102 align:middle line:84%
considering the four different
phases of the menstrual cycle.

00:22:05.102 --> 00:22:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think a lot of
men would agree with that.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.122 align:middle line:90%
They'd say, jeez, I can't--

00:22:09.122 --> 00:22:10.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who
she's going to be.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's a cliche, but
there is a certain amount

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:13.540 align:middle line:90%
of truth to it.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But we're also not
rocking the power in it.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Exactly.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is the beauty and
this is the divine nature

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:27.530 align:middle line:84%
of the female biology that
is so brilliantly designed,

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:84%
because each of the four
phases has their own benefits

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.420 align:middle line:90%
and their own limitations.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
it from day one of the cycle.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, so phase
one is the menstruation phase.

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, the
majority of women out there,

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:48.740 align:middle line:84%
because of the lack of education
that we have about our bodies,

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.380 align:middle line:84%
are really only aware
of this first phase.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:52.970 align:middle line:90%
But it's only one of four.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:56.180 align:middle line:10%
So in phase one,
menstruation, this

00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:00.980 align:middle line:10%
is marked by the lowest levels
of estrogen and progesterone,

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.380 align:middle line:10%
these two key
ovarian hormones that

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.990 align:middle line:10%
set the pace of our
biology at large.

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, because estrogen
and progesterone

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:12.320 align:middle line:84%
are at their lowest
levels, in phase one,

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:16.610 align:middle line:84%
our energy levels are naturally
lower during this phase,

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:20.720 align:middle line:84%
because we're actually
producing less ATP

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:84%
to energize ourselves and
perform all the functions

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:28.130 align:middle line:84%
that we need to perform, so
we have a little bit less fuel

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:84%
available to us during
that first phase.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:35.300 align:middle line:84%
We also see our metabolic
function slow down.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And what we see neurologically
is kind of a different story.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So as things shift
neurologically

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:48.080 align:middle line:84%
to kind of match this
ebb of those hormones,

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:53.130 align:middle line:84%
what we see is that women have
enhanced cognitive empathy,

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:55.460 align:middle line:90%
especially during this phase.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:24:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is just a fancy
scientific term for intuition.

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:03.230 align:middle line:84%
So a woman's intuitive
insight is heightened

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:06.318 align:middle line:90%
during phase one of her cycle.

00:24:06.318 --> 00:24:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With the estrogen
and progesterone kind

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.020 align:middle line:90%
of tanked for that period.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:10.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.975 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, so if
you think about this,

00:24:11.975 --> 00:24:13.550 align:middle line:90%
how brilliant is that?

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Our body knows exactly what it
wants and needs in order for us

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:20.270 align:middle line:84%
to tap into that
superpower that we get.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.580 align:middle line:90%
It is telling us, slow down.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
not only telling us.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.520 align:middle line:90%
It is slowing it down.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Demanding it, yeah.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: It is
slowing us down,

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and it's telling
us, hey, go inward.

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Focus a little more
inward so that you

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:38.000 align:middle line:84%
can tap into this cognitive
superpower of this heightened

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.780 align:middle line:90%
intuitive insight.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is a great
time for assessment.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:46.910 align:middle line:84%
This is a great time
for internal reflection

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.310 align:middle line:90%
or reflection on your projects.

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:53.060 align:middle line:84%
If you think about women
in leadership roles,

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:84%
this is when you should
be doing your analysis

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and your strategic
kind of planning

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.370 align:middle line:90%
and moving things around.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:05.720 align:middle line:84%
This is when you can
allocate your resources most

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.730 align:middle line:84%
effectively,
because you're going

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.830 align:middle line:84%
to be able to utilize
that intuitive insight

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:11.630 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.443 align:middle line:84%
So that's the time-- if
you're in a capacity where

00:25:14.443 --> 00:25:17.900 align:middle line:84%
you work for yourself or it's a
small corporation where you can

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.170 align:middle line:84%
manage your time as you wish,
if women were aware of this,

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:23.310 align:middle line:84%
this would be, as you say,
the time of assessment

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:24.110 align:middle line:90%
and planning.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Absolutely.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we typically see is
that we bypass this superpower.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:31.943 align:middle line:90%
We kind of skip over it.

00:25:31.943 --> 00:25:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Drink more coffee.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.340 align:middle line:90%
Get more energy going.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yep, because
we ignore those cues

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:39.020 align:middle line:84%
from our body, and we say,
oh, forget about that.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to have
lower energy right now.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to drink an
extra cup of coffee,

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to take all
these supplements to ramp up

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:48.777 align:middle line:90%
my metabolism and my focus.

00:25:48.777 --> 00:25:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
work out really hard,

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.500 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just going
to push through.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Get back
on that train.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.833 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: I'm just
going to push through.

00:25:54.833 --> 00:25:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And this comes from the
idea that consistency

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:90%
is the key to success.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.290 align:middle line:84%
But I am here to tell
you and all women

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:08.730 align:middle line:84%
out there that consistency is
the killer for success for us,

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:12.603 align:middle line:84%
because we need to do things
in more of a fluid way.

00:26:12.603 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.110 align:middle line:84%
I love-- and thank you, because
so many women feel the truth

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:17.360 align:middle line:90%
in what you're saying already.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to the
next three phases.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I think this is just such
new and exciting information

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.700 align:middle line:84%
for both women and men,
because it helps us understand

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.030 align:middle line:90%
each other so much better.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:28.400 align:middle line:90%
So let's go to phase two.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, absolutely.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.957 align:middle line:84%
So phase two is called
the follicular phase.

00:26:32.957 --> 00:26:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And I have to give a
little bit of a caveat,

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.280 align:middle line:84%
because each phase
doesn't fit perfectly

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.170 align:middle line:90%
into its own little box.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:43.820 align:middle line:84%
However, the overall
shifts in our biochemistry

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and our neurochemistry
and our physiological

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:49.340 align:middle line:84%
function is marked by
four different phases

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and what's going on with
our ovarian hormones

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.100 align:middle line:90%
in those phases.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.300 align:middle line:84%
So phase two is the
follicular phase,

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and this is marked
by a steady rise

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:04.190 align:middle line:84%
to a peak in estrogen, one of
those key ovarian hormones.

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, estrogen does some really
interesting things to us,

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:12.790 align:middle line:84%
including it starts to ramp
up our production of ATP.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:16.490 align:middle line:84%
It starts to elevate
our energy levels.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.150 align:middle line:84%
It also starts to
help us increase

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:23.980 align:middle line:84%
our stamina, our endurance,
our power, our strength.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And it increases our
metabolic function, of course.

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:29.030 align:middle line:90%
That goes along with it.

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.750 align:middle line:84%
But when we look at what's
going on neurologically

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:34.870 align:middle line:84%
and cognitively,
what happens is we

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:39.100 align:middle line:84%
get enhanced ability
for navigation

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and enhanced ability for
kind of strategic action.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.070 align:middle line:84%
So what we also
see that's really

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:51.340 align:middle line:84%
interesting in this
phase is enhanced

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.810 align:middle line:90%
emotional intelligence.

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So as we move through
the follicular

00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:01.270 align:middle line:84%
phase, our navigational,
strategic movements

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:02.500 align:middle line:90%
are enhanced.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about
this, it can be really

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:08.710 align:middle line:84%
a game changer in our
roles and especially

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:12.580 align:middle line:84%
in leadership roles as women
when we can start to understand

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:17.380 align:middle line:84%
and map out our lifestyles and
our efforts to match what's

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.800 align:middle line:90%
going on in our bodies.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: So phase one,
we're doing our analysis.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Phase two, we're
shifting into action,

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.750 align:middle line:84%
and we're able to
navigate more effectively.

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And in tandem, our emotional
intelligence is rising.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.010 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to be able to
communicate more effectively

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:40.877 align:middle line:84%
and interact with our teams
in a more profound way.

00:28:40.877 --> 00:28:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:43.210 align:middle line:90%
OK, phase three.

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: So phase three
is the ovulatory phase,

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and this is a very short
phase, between one and three

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.480 align:middle line:84%
days, depending on the
woman, and every woman

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.660 align:middle line:84%
is different as well in
the length of her cycle.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:59.080 align:middle line:84%
But phase three,
the ovulation phase,

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.900 align:middle line:84%
is marked by the
peak of estrogen,

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.740 align:middle line:84%
but also the peak of
luteinizing hormone

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and follicle-stimulating
hormone.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.144 align:middle line:90%
And so this is--

00:29:09.144 --> 00:29:09.977 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: FSH, yeah.

00:29:09.977 --> 00:29:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah, and
so this is the phase

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.430 align:middle line:84%
that I have nicknamed "the
bloom phase," because this

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:17.260 align:middle line:90%
is when women are in bloom.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.210 align:middle line:90%
They're feeling their very best.

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Their energy levels
are at their highest.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Their power, strength,
and endurance

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.130 align:middle line:84%
are at their highest
level, and they are just

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:30.130 align:middle line:90%
feeling cognitively on fire.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:33.370 align:middle line:84%
They're feeling very
focused and very energetic.

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at this
cognitive benefit that

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:40.180 align:middle line:84%
comes online, we have
more charismatic influence

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.360 align:middle line:90%
during this time.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.510 align:middle line:84%
We're more magnetic,
you could say.

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.843 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's key for
leadership, to have that phase.

00:29:45.843 --> 00:29:46.843 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Absolutely.

00:29:46.843 --> 00:29:47.830 align:middle line:90%
Now, think about this.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:51.860 align:middle line:84%
If we could leverage
that to do our pitches--

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Any presentation, whatever
you're in, your presentation--

00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.650 align:middle line:84%
that's so important to
know, and we haven't a clue.

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So we have a time
designed in our own cycle,

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.910 align:middle line:84%
as women, where we can really
pull out the best in ourselves

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.490 align:middle line:84%
to charismatically
influence an outcome.

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, absolutely.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And we are feeling
socially outwardly focused

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:18.580 align:middle line:84%
during this time, which is
a contrast to, for instance,

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.140 align:middle line:84%
menstruation phase
one, when we're

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.060 align:middle line:90%
feeling a little more subdued.

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:25.390 align:middle line:84%
But during phase
three, not only are

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:28.420 align:middle line:84%
we feeling very energetic
and outwardly focused,

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:32.440 align:middle line:84%
but we also have a nice
boost in our mood-boosting

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.370 align:middle line:84%
neurochemicals, namely
serotonin, dopamine,

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:38.060 align:middle line:90%
epinephrine, and norepinephrine.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So we have a little boost
in these mood chemicals

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:44.680 align:middle line:84%
that also makes us
feel very energetic

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and vibrant and magnetic
during this phase.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Phase four.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: So phase four--

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:53.230 align:middle line:84%
this is my favorite
phase of all.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:55.900 align:middle line:84%
This is what I have
nicknamed "the grow phase,"

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and what I mean by that is our
brain and our ability to learn

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.290 align:middle line:84%
is actually growing
during this phase.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And luckily, this is
the longest of all four

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.730 align:middle line:90%
phases, about two weeks.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's different
for every woman,

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.440 align:middle line:84%
but during this
last phase, which

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.320 align:middle line:84%
is called the luteal
phase, this is

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:19.930 align:middle line:84%
when the key player, the star of
the show becomes progesterone.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And it shifts from
estrogen. So as progesterone

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:28.060 align:middle line:84%
rises to a peak, there's some
really interesting things

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.880 align:middle line:84%
that happen
neurologically for women.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.650 align:middle line:84%
One of them is that we get
a boost in a neurochemical

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:39.940 align:middle line:84%
called brain-derived
neurotrophic factor, or BDNF.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, this neurochemical has
some really cool impacts

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:49.457 align:middle line:84%
on the human brain, one of which
is increased neuroplasticity

00:31:49.457 --> 00:31:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.070 align:middle line:84%
So you can stretch
and grow, yeah.

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:57.180 align:middle line:84%
So neuroplasticity is
related to neural pathways,

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and you can think of
neural pathways as related

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.660 align:middle line:90%
to behaviors.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And so our ability to change our
behaviors and learn new things

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and create new neural
pathways and get

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.630 align:middle line:84%
rid of old neural pathways
that we don't necessarily want

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.820 align:middle line:90%
is heightened during this phase.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let
me ask you this.

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Once you understood
all of this, I

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.750 align:middle line:84%
assume you started applying
it to your own life.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And did you notice a difference
in your levels of intuition,

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.720 align:middle line:90%
productivity, and everything?

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Oh, yes.

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.130 align:middle line:90%
It's been a game changer.

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And all of the women who I've
had the ability to teach this

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:39.870 align:middle line:84%
to have experienced
the same thing,

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's so amazing to
watch the light bulb

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.840 align:middle line:84%
turn on for women when they
learn about their body,

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and they actually get permission
to be four different people

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.630 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
course of the month

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and operate differently and
tap into these superpowers.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:57.100 align:middle line:90%
It's just incredible.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.040 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most
rewarding things

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.360 align:middle line:90%
that I get to experience.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I bet.

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: So going back to
that brain-derived neurotrophic

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:10.410 align:middle line:84%
factor, it also influences
our neurogenesis.

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:13.560 align:middle line:84%
So not only do we have a
heightened ability to kind

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.870 align:middle line:84%
of shape and mold the brain
and those neural pathways,

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:19.110 align:middle line:84%
but we also have
a greater capacity

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.480 align:middle line:90%
to actually grow new neurons.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
this is wonderful.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah,
so again, our brain

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.780 align:middle line:84%
is actually growing
and shifting.

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Our ability to learn is
heightened during this phase.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.290 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
another neurochemical

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:37.770 align:middle line:84%
that comes online strongly
during this phase, which

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:40.720 align:middle line:90%
is the GABA neurotransmitter.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, the GABA
neurotransmitter is

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:45.840 align:middle line:84%
involved in getting
restful sleep and also

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.920 align:middle line:90%
memory consolidation.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So we have heightened
memory consolidation, which

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.370 align:middle line:90%
is important for learning.

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
greater capacity,

00:33:56.130 --> 00:34:00.240 align:middle line:84%
greater ability to get the
benefits of restful sleep

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.293 align:middle line:90%
during this phase.

00:34:01.293 --> 00:34:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you so much.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
breaking those down

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.180 align:middle line:84%
for us, because I know
women right now are stopping

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.909 align:middle line:84%
to write things down and
saying, holy cow, I had no idea.

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:10.840 align:middle line:84%
A couple of
practical questions--

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.070 align:middle line:84%
so what happens if, say, a
woman's on birth control?

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Does that change anything, or
does the same pattern apply?

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:19.929 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: This
is a great question.

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:24.150 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what the
woman's status is hormonally,

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:30.300 align:middle line:84%
she will be experiencing the
cyclic nature to her biology.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So if a woman's on birth
control, which, by the way,

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:37.020 align:middle line:84%
is a form of hormone
replacement therapy,

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.679 align:middle line:84%
or if she's on hormone
replacement therapy

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:42.052 align:middle line:90%
for a different purpose--

00:34:42.052 --> 00:34:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or post-menopausal.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.719 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: --or
post-menopausal, her body

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:49.050 align:middle line:84%
still operates in
this cyclic fashion

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:52.469 align:middle line:84%
and still goes through
these four phases.

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:54.989 align:middle line:84%
Now, with women
post-menopausally,

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:57.892 align:middle line:84%
this gets a little
more esoteric.

00:34:57.892 --> 00:34:58.692 align:middle line:90%
Simply--

00:34:58.692 --> 00:35:00.942 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say
it has to be more subtle.

00:35:00.942 --> 00:35:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So talk about this
esoteric range then.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah, it's a
little more esoteric, just

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:11.190 align:middle line:84%
simply because there is not
a lot of empirical evidence

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:14.880 align:middle line:84%
that shows that women still
have this cyclic nature

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.140 align:middle line:90%
to their biology.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's simply because it has
not been researched whatsoever.

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.020 align:middle line:90%
You're going to fix that.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:23.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:27.780 align:middle line:84%
However, what we see with the
anecdotal evidence of women

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.690 align:middle line:84%
from around the world-- we're
talking hundreds and thousands

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:34.350 align:middle line:84%
of women who report
still having this ebb

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:37.410 align:middle line:84%
and flow in their energy
levels, in their mood,

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:41.250 align:middle line:84%
in their cognitive function,
even after menopause.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And my theory, as a
scientist, in what's

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:49.500 align:middle line:84%
going on with this is that
even post-menopausally,

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.250 align:middle line:84%
women still have this cyclic
nature to their biology

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:55.380 align:middle line:90%
that follows a monthly rhythm.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that is
because, for so many years,

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:03.570 align:middle line:84%
the majority of our lives,
our biology and physiology

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:07.920 align:middle line:84%
has been groomed to
operate in this cyclic way.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens at menopause
is the ovarian hormones

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:16.530 align:middle line:84%
that are really running the
show for women pass on the baton

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:19.170 align:middle line:90%
to the adrenals.

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:21.660 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean
that, at that point,

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.910 align:middle line:90%
women just turn into men, right?

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:28.110 align:middle line:84%
We still have much higher levels
of estrogen and progesterone

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.770 align:middle line:90%
than our male counterparts.

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And because our body
has been operating

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.950 align:middle line:84%
in this cyclic
fashion for so long,

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:38.670 align:middle line:84%
we still operate in
that way, or at least

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.310 align:middle line:84%
that's what the anecdotal
evidence is showing.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And as you mentioned,
I really hope

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:46.320 align:middle line:84%
that the empirical
research and evidence

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.330 align:middle line:84%
will catch up and start
to take a look at this.

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I
want to get to a couple

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.850 align:middle line:84%
of other major points in
what time we have left,

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and one of them is the
whole phenomena of COVID

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.810 align:middle line:84%
and having people begin
working from home,

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:01.570 align:middle line:84%
having women, who
were going to offices

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:04.120 align:middle line:84%
and working in this most
kind of industrial model

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:07.630 align:middle line:84%
that's more wired for dopamine
in men, were staying home.

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to
follow these rhythms better,

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:13.392 align:middle line:84%
and there has been a mass exodus
of women from the workforce.

00:37:13.392 --> 00:37:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
share that, because I

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.600 align:middle line:84%
don't think-- they
don't report that

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.370 align:middle line:90%
much on the news about this.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what's happening

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.840 align:middle line:84%
and what's going to
happen from here out.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.570 align:middle line:84%
UK, for example, said, OK,
everybody, back to the office.

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:27.210 align:middle line:90%
We're done with COVID, right?

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's going to
happen-- what has happened,

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:30.875 align:middle line:90%
and what's going to happen?

00:37:30.875 --> 00:37:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Exactly.

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:33.340 align:middle line:90%
You are exactly right.

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:37.330 align:middle line:84%
In 2020, we had the largest
mass exodus from women

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:40.930 align:middle line:84%
from the workforce that we
have ever seen historically.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we have to put it
in a fair place in that, yeah,

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:44.560 align:middle line:90%
we had COVID.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you couldn't find daycare.

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:47.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.590 align:middle line:90%
OK, we get all that.

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:49.390 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes,
and that's true,

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and that's largely the reason
why we saw two times as many

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.970 align:middle line:84%
women leave the workforce
than we saw men--

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:03.100 align:middle line:84%
because of our roles in our
families and all of that.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.910 align:middle line:84%
However, since
schools and after care

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.340 align:middle line:84%
and all of these things
have opened back up,

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.310 align:middle line:84%
we still haven't
seen women rejoin

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.890 align:middle line:84%
the workforce in the
same rates as we've

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:17.810 align:middle line:90%
seen men rejoin the workforce.

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And so women are not
going back to work.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:21.190 align:middle line:90%
And so it does.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:23.110 align:middle line:90%
It begs the question, why?

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:24.310 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because
going back to the way

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:31.360 align:middle line:84%
that our societies are set up
and the infrastructures are

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.720 align:middle line:84%
set up actually work
against the female biology.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: And working in that
way, you know, that consistent,

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:43.900 align:middle line:84%
repeating 24-hour system where
there are the same expectations

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.180 align:middle line:84%
of performance day
in and day out,

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.070 align:middle line:84%
it eventually leads
women to burn out.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happened in
2020, when we started

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:54.790 align:middle line:84%
to be able to work
from home, women

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:58.100 align:middle line:84%
realized that they could
do things differently

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and that they could operate in
a way that actually feels better

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.940 align:middle line:90%
to them naturally.

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And statistically,
I mean, the workload was--

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:08.360 align:middle line:90%
they were performing.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.060 align:middle line:90%
They were performing.

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Actually,
I would argue

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.720 align:middle line:84%
that they were
performing better,

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.840 align:middle line:84%
because they were
actually giving

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.800 align:middle line:90%
their body what it needed.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Now,
they probably didn't

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.910 align:middle line:84%
have the scientific
explanation about what's

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:27.880 align:middle line:84%
going on in their body,
but they probably tapped

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:32.860 align:middle line:84%
into that intuitive insight and
understood that it feels better

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.800 align:middle line:84%
in their body to do things
differently and have

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.160 align:middle line:84%
more flexibility to
do things differently

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.355 align:middle line:90%
throughout the month.

00:39:40.355 --> 00:39:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is just so
important that this information

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:46.000 align:middle line:84%
become mainstream and
that corporations,

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.320 align:middle line:90%
education systems--

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.720 align:middle line:84%
because this has
to mean something

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.150 align:middle line:84%
very different for girls who
are going through puberty

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:54.460 align:middle line:84%
versus boys going through
puberty and the way

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.995 align:middle line:84%
the educational
system is set up.

00:39:55.995 --> 00:39:56.995 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Absolutely.

00:39:56.995 --> 00:39:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It can't
work for both,

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.420 align:middle line:90%
considering these differences.

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Absolutely.

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:04.210 align:middle line:90%
Now, the silver lining--

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:06.790 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, I'm
an eternal optimist,

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:09.530 align:middle line:84%
so I just always want to
highlight the silver lining

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:10.330 align:middle line:90%
here--

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:14.080 align:middle line:84%
is that because
of this experience

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.800 align:middle line:84%
that we had where we are
experiencing sweeping changes

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.680 align:middle line:84%
across the globe all
at the same time,

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and we are experiencing kind
of this shocking experience

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:27.640 align:middle line:84%
of a global epidemic
across the globe,

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.340 align:middle line:84%
all people at the
same time, this

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:35.410 align:middle line:84%
brings this really great
opportunity for massive change

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:36.980 align:middle line:90%
and massive behavior change--

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:37.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: --which is
typically very difficult

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:41.110 align:middle line:90%
to achieve.

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
of a couple things.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So one is that when
we're experiencing

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:51.190 align:middle line:84%
traumatic or shocking or
novel experiences, what

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:53.800 align:middle line:84%
happens in the human
brain is that we

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:57.160 align:middle line:84%
get a boost in neuroplasticity,
what we were talking

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.930 align:middle line:90%
about earlier in the cycles.

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is for all
people, men and women.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.270 align:middle line:84%
So right now,
across the globe, we

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:07.210 align:middle line:84%
have this enhanced
neuroplasticity

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and this enhanced ability
to learn, shift, and change

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.400 align:middle line:90%
our behaviors.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing that
happens when we experience

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:18.010 align:middle line:84%
these new and
shocking experiences

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:21.490 align:middle line:84%
is that it brings the
subconscious mind forward,

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:24.830 align:middle line:84%
which typically can be kind
of difficult to access.

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So these are kind
of the programs

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:31.390 align:middle line:84%
that are set in the background
of our operation as humans.

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, when that gets
brought forward,

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:38.230 align:middle line:84%
we can more easily
change those programs

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:41.080 align:middle line:84%
so that we can
behave differently.

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Greater
neuroplasticity--

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in times of trauma.

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this is
the greatest time to change.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Absolutely.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So now, going back to
those shifts that we need,

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:58.090 align:middle line:84%
in order to support half of
the population in a better way,

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:00.320 align:middle line:84%
we need to do this
in a couple of ways.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.070 align:middle line:84%
So one is more of a
top-down approach,

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and that would be looking at
these societal infrastructures,

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and especially in
the corporate world,

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:13.270 align:middle line:84%
looking at the environments and
infrastructures and schedules

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:19.030 align:middle line:84%
and starting to introduce
some flexibility so that women

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:22.210 align:middle line:84%
can operate differently
and in partnership

00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:24.520 align:middle line:84%
with their bodies
and their cycles

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.010 align:middle line:84%
so that they can perform
at a higher level.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At a higher
level, absolutely.

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:31.138 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be maybe a
little more challenging when

00:42:31.138 --> 00:42:33.160 align:middle line:84%
it comes to the
educational system

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and how that can be worked out,
so there's some kind of equity,

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:38.380 align:middle line:90%
but it can be done.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.880 align:middle line:84%
The problem is we
have no knowledge.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And you-- that's why I
love what you're doing--

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:46.630 align:middle line:84%
you're of a generation that is
bringing this forward and going

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:49.120 align:middle line:84%
to really be able to now
dedicate your life to this.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding-- I
think when we talked last,

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.590 align:middle line:90%
you're working on an app?

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:57.895 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, so I can't
share too much about it yet.

00:42:57.895 --> 00:43:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, tell us a little
bit, though, because how

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:02.117 align:middle line:90%
do we know where we are, right?

00:43:02.117 --> 00:43:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, exactly.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, right.

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: So it can be
a little tricky for women

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.180 align:middle line:84%
to really understand what's
going on in their body

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and where they are
in their cycle,

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:15.140 align:middle line:84%
and especially if they're in
those parts of their life cycle

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:20.060 align:middle line:84%
where they don't have an
active period that they can use

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:23.810 align:middle line:84%
to track, or for other women
who are on hormone replacement

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:26.810 align:middle line:84%
therapy and may not
have that milestone

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:28.550 align:middle line:90%
that they can use to track.

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, because of those
greater physiological changes,

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:36.860 align:middle line:84%
there are other metrics that
we can use to track our cycles.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.840 align:middle line:84%
So I've developed
some technology,

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:43.167 align:middle line:84%
some femtech that will be
coming out later on this year.

00:43:43.167 --> 00:43:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: And this will
allow women of any walk of life

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:53.450 align:middle line:84%
to be able to understand what's
going on with their bodies.

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And really, it will help
to raise self-awareness,

00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:58.190 align:middle line:84%
which is the first
step that we need

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:00.350 align:middle line:90%
for this massive global change.

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And it will give
them some education

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:05.060 align:middle line:84%
about a lot of the things
that we discuss today.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, to be able
to go into their own rhythms

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.443 align:middle line:84%
and use the powers of
each cycle, like you're

00:44:10.443 --> 00:44:12.110 align:middle line:84%
doing consciously and
some of the people

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:13.950 align:middle line:84%
that you've coached
and worked with.

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Absolutely.

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:20.420 align:middle line:84%
So going back to those
global shifts that we need,

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.630 align:middle line:84%
this goes into that
bottom-up approach

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:26.810 align:middle line:84%
that's needed in tandem
with that top-down approach.

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:28.910 align:middle line:90%
We need education.

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:33.080 align:middle line:84%
We need to educate,
especially, our young women

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:37.850 align:middle line:84%
about their bodies and give
them that user's manual

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:40.250 align:middle line:90%
that we all desperately need.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I couldn't agree more.

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:44.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know you're
on it, and Katrine said,

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:46.280 align:middle line:90%
you have to interview Kayla.

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.040 align:middle line:84%
She is going to change
the world in this way.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.748 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with that.

00:44:50.748 --> 00:44:52.790 align:middle line:84%
If there's one final
thought you want to put out,

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:54.620 align:middle line:90%
we've got just a few seconds.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, the one final
thing that I'd like to say

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:03.050 align:middle line:84%
is that I want everyone
to look around and take

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:06.560 align:middle line:84%
stock of what we have the
opportunity for right now.

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Women are the greatest
untapped resource

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.010 align:middle line:84%
that modern society
has access to

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:18.345 align:middle line:84%
in order to create massive
global change and evolution.

00:45:18.345 --> 00:45:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hear, hear.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: In order to
tap into that resource,

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:23.780 align:middle line:90%
we need to support our women.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:27.710 align:middle line:10%
>>OSTERHOFF: One,
women need permission

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:28.950 align:middle line:10%
to do things differently.

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:29.750 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:31.417 align:middle line:10%
>>OSTERHOFF: And the
second step to that

00:45:31.417 --> 00:45:36.485 align:middle line:10%
is allowing them flexibility in
order to do things differently.

00:45:36.485 --> 00:45:38.360 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Nothing more
to add to that, Kayla.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.530 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much.

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:41.690 align:middle line:10%
And I would like to
have you back once you

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:44.990 align:middle line:10%
have this app at a point where
it's developed and available

00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:46.730 align:middle line:10%
and we can see
how we use it, OK?

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, please.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.245 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you so much
for dedicating yourself

00:45:49.245 --> 00:45:53.310 align:middle line:84%
to this just desperately
needed body of information.

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Thank you so much.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:58.070 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You can find out more
about Kayla's research and app

00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:01.370 align:middle line:10%
