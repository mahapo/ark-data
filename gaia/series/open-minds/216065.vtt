00:00:18.873 --> 00:00:20.540 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Humanity has suffered

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.670 align:middle line:10%
through a number of cataclysms
and mass extinctions.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.740 align:middle line:10%
But according to Paul Wallis, we
had help pulling ourselves out

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.540 align:middle line:10%
of it.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, we're
talking about visitors

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.750 align:middle line:84%
from other planets or realms
that helped us get on our feet

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.075 align:middle line:90%
and start over again.

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:84%
At this time,
we're going through

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:84%
catastrophic social and
governmental upheaval

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.530 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
world, leaving many

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.910 align:middle line:84%
of the vulnerable and
displaced unattended to.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.190 align:middle line:90%
So where are our helpers now?

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:90%
We'll get to all of that.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Paul, it's so good
to see you again.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL WALLIS: Good day, Regina.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.780 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be back with you.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Good day.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:84%
You're just about
over your jet lag.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Which province do
you live in again?

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Queensland, Australia.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: So it's a two-day
journey to get here.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And two days to get
over the jet lag.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: That's it.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.835 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you so much
for going to all the trouble.

00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:04.450 align:middle line:84%
But this is a
wonderful conversation.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.850 align:middle line:84%
You have a new book out
called The Eden Enigma.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And you're digging
deeper into the evidence

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.690 align:middle line:84%
of these cultures who have
been here both to help humanity

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.410 align:middle line:90%
and not so much.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at some
of the evidence for this.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.710 align:middle line:90%
So let's start in--

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:84%
First of all, this
gets into a subject.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:84%
You and Father Sean Olaire and I
had a conversation at one point.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.450 align:middle line:84%
The three of us were
talking about the nature

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.860 align:middle line:90%
of good and evil.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's not so easy.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.170 align:middle line:84%
That's not an easy
topic to take on.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.520 align:middle line:10%
But in a really short
summary, just to bring people

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.240 align:middle line:10%
into this conversation,
tell us how you ended up

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.580 align:middle line:10%
kind of articulating the notion
of good and evil on this planet.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Well, where I go
to is Plato, who I find

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.530 align:middle line:90%
really helpful on this topic.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And I get a notion of
what good and evil means

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.300 align:middle line:84%
from Plato's explanation
of who we are,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:84%
where we all came from,
how everything began.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:10%
I love Plato because
he applies logic

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.130 align:middle line:10%
to things we can all observe,
and then step by step,

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.910 align:middle line:10%
he gets to these incredible,
far reaching conclusions.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.840 align:middle line:10%
And one of his conclusions
is that before the material

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:10%
universe existed, there was a
unified field of consciousness,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.120 align:middle line:10%
to use modern language
on it, and that

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.890 align:middle line:10%
preceded all matter or energy,
time, the unified field

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.310 align:middle line:10%
of human consciousness.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And he said the
material universe

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.780 align:middle line:84%
came into being so that that
consciousness could experience

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:90%
itself and have experiences.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And so it really
sets up a question,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:84%
can we do unified
consciousness as a material

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:84%
realm of separate entities
exercising free choice?

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And everything that answers
yes, yes, we can to that

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:90%
question we call good.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And if we think, what does
unified consciousness look like?

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a material universe,
that's order, that's harmony.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.060 align:middle line:90%
Can we do it?

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.610 align:middle line:84%
If the answer is yes,
we call that good.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Everything that answers
no to that question,

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.610 align:middle line:84%
we call that bad,
we call that evil.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's my start point for
understanding good and evil.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.320 align:middle line:90%
That's very good.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.640 align:middle line:84%
That's a good place to start
at, because really, that's

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.180 align:middle line:84%
a question facing a lot of
us right at this moment.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Your new book landed
you in Turkey,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.520 align:middle line:84%
where you're finding
further evidence.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
hot spot right now.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Some of the other
Tepes are coming out.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.580 align:middle line:84%
People are writing books
on some of their findings.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.810 align:middle line:90%
You had your own findings.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.370 align:middle line:84%
You were surprised
because of them.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:10%
Some of them were
really quite subtle

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.720 align:middle line:10%
and they could have been
overlooked quite easily.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.640 align:middle line:10%
So let's take this
story now to Turkey

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:10%
and the story of
some of the beings

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.940 align:middle line:10%
who had been there before.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.240 align:middle line:10%
I think their names
are the Haldi.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: That's right.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So the group is the Tengri
and if you read historians

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.860 align:middle line:84%
and archaeologists, they will
say the Tengri were the gods

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:84%
of the Urartian people who
lived in Turkey 3,000 years ago.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.480 align:middle line:10%
But the problem is, as soon
as we translate their stories

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.380 align:middle line:10%
and use the word gods,
we've distorted it,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.270 align:middle line:10%
because that's not what
Tengri really means.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:10%
And so Haldi and his friends,
you listen to the stories,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.890 align:middle line:10%
read the inscriptions,
look at the carvings,

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.880 align:middle line:10%
the stories that
emerge are not of gods

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.960 align:middle line:10%
as in supernatural,
transcendent, infinite, probably

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.230 align:middle line:10%
imagined beings, because
that's what gods means to us.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.160 align:middle line:84%
They're actually talking
about advanced beings who

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.970 align:middle line:84%
lived with their ancestors
for a while in the past

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.700 align:middle line:90%
and helped them out.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.560 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't worship them.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:84%
They remember them with
love and gratitude.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.370 align:middle line:84%
They honor them in their
stories and inscriptions,

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:90%
but they didn't worship them.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That means they
probably did not fear them.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: No, they
didn't fear them.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.020 align:middle line:84%
They were thankful
for their presence.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.813 align:middle line:84%
They saw it as a golden age when
they lived in their presence.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.430 align:middle line:84%
So that would have been around
the time in Egypt, not far away,

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.940 align:middle line:84%
of the 18th dynasty, and there
was a lot of very high thinking

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.060 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Well, these stories
were told 3,000 years ago,

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.890 align:middle line:90%
but they're referring back--

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Back further when
they were originally there.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.145 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Much further.

00:05:29.145 --> 00:05:29.945 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:29.945 --> 00:05:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: And what
interested me as I

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.090 align:middle line:84%
began getting into their stories
was that these beings had

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:90%
very finite powers.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:90%
So they weren't godlike.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.230 align:middle line:84%
They had advanced capabilities,
but there were some limits

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.770 align:middle line:90%
on what they could do.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:10%
And so we've got beings called
Haldi, Arubani, Irmusini,

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.710 align:middle line:10%
Siuini, Teishebaini.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:10%
And they are all honored
with having altered

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:10%
the environment,
introduced agriculture,

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:10%
but they weren't
supernatural or mighty.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle line:84%
They weren't able to prevent the
chaos that their ancestors had

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.980 align:middle line:84%
to live through, but they were
able to come alongside them

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.970 align:middle line:84%
as they emerged from the
chaos and support them

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.680 align:middle line:90%
in rebuilding civilization.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.502 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the heart
of the Urartian stories.

00:06:20.502 --> 00:06:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, goodness.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:90%
And that had happened before.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, with the various
destructions of Atlantis

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.310 align:middle line:84%
and final destruction
of Atlantis,

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.530 align:middle line:90%
it was really kind of rebooting.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:10%
Fortunately, some
of that knowledge

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.880 align:middle line:10%
from the people of Atlantis
had been taken off and moved

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:10%
through the Mayan culture
and over into Europe

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.900 align:middle line:10%
and into Egypt and Africa.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.642 align:middle line:10%
But they had help, too.

00:06:43.642 --> 00:06:45.850 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't just the people
taking some of the legends.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.410 align:middle line:10%
We needed help rebuilding.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:48.270 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Exactly.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And those stories of helpful
intervention, they're global.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: There are versions
all around the world,

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and especially around the
advent of agriculture.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to
Zulu story, you'll

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:84%
hear about Mbaba Mwana Waresa,
who introduces wheat and beer.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:90%
Good for her.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.560 align:middle line:10%
And then you've got
Itzamna in the Mayan

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.550 align:middle line:10%
culture, who introduced
particular crops to the Mayan

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.020 align:middle line:10%
people.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:10%
The Babylonian story talks
about Oannes, an Upkallu,

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:10%
introducing agriculture
and city building.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.030 align:middle line:90%
All around the world.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.360 align:middle line:84%
In Australia, there's
a fascinating example.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Up at the top end in
the Northern territory,

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.890 align:middle line:84%
there's a people group
called the Yolngu people.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And Aboriginal Australians
are renowned for knowing

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.420 align:middle line:84%
how to live in balance
with the environment,

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.480 align:middle line:84%
knowing about the land, knowing
everything about the flora

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and fauna, yet they tell
a story of their ancestors

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.090 align:middle line:90%
not having any of those skills.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.620 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
which plants were

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.880 align:middle line:84%
good to eat, which had to be
avoided, what animals you could

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:84%
hunt and eat, which you
couldn't, how to fish.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And the story they tell
is that their elders,

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.760 align:middle line:84%
not knowing any of
this, had to learn it

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.580 align:middle line:84%
from non-human beings who
were living in the region

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.120 align:middle line:84%
at that time, who they
called the Mimih people,

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.010 align:middle line:90%
or the Mimih spirits.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.090 align:middle line:10%
And when they use
the word spirits,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:10%
all that means is they could
turn up and leave by means

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:10%
they didn't understand.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.190 align:middle line:90%
That's what that word means.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was the Mimih who taught
them the dance of the hunt,

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and the dance of fishing,
and the dance of the harvest.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.660 align:middle line:10%
And so all around
the world, we have

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.640 align:middle line:10%
stories like this where
humanity was in a situation

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:10%
where survival was uncertain,
and then these non-human others

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.400 align:middle line:10%
appear to help us
through that moment,

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.770 align:middle line:10%
give us an education so that
we can re-establish ourselves

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.260 align:middle line:10%
in some kind of
change that we've

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.810 align:middle line:10%
gone through, which I
believe was cataclysm,

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.670 align:middle line:10%
an environmental cataclysm.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And it echoes all
around the world.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:06.630 align:middle line:10%
So going back to our first topic
of the nature of good and evil,

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:11.330 align:middle line:10%
as you perceive
through Plato, this

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:16.830 align:middle line:10%
would constitute good in that
these beings came any time--

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.290 align:middle line:10%
it seems to me, I've watched--

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.460 align:middle line:10%
I mean, just in my
lifetime I've watched.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.870 align:middle line:10%
And whenever there is
supposedly a group of beings,

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.430 align:middle line:10%
whether they're
off planet or not,

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.420 align:middle line:10%
or humans that demand fealty,
that say, I'm the way,

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.360 align:middle line:10%
I'm the only one,
only I can do this

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:10%
and there's retribution
if you don't worship them,

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.840 align:middle line:10%
I've always perceived
that as evil.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yes.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just even as a
little kid, my own perception

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.580 align:middle line:90%
of that was even in the Bible.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.580 align:middle line:84%
I had a very different
view of the Bible at five

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.995 align:middle line:90%
than I should have.

00:09:47.995 --> 00:09:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Good for you.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I questioned
everything back then,

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:90%
and I thought, no, that's evil.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.280 align:middle line:84%
You don't make people do
those kinds of things.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.790 align:middle line:10%
So what you're talking
about is the very force

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.400 align:middle line:10%
of good from these
visitors that came

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.870 align:middle line:10%
to help us establish,
not demand,

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.180 align:middle line:10%
not creating fear
and not demanding

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.590 align:middle line:10%
we worship them and not
having any kind of retribution

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:10%
if we didn't do what they said.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: That's
absolutely correct.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And especially in
the Urartian story,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.570 align:middle line:84%
they loved the Tengri
who lived among them.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.390 align:middle line:84%
They were thankful for the
education they received.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:24.780 align:middle line:84%
They were taught how to live in
balance with the environment,

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.850 align:middle line:90%
how to help the environment.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.270 align:middle line:10%
So you've got the environment,
the people, the visitors,

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:34.200 align:middle line:10%
and they are doing intelligence
and harmony together.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.290 align:middle line:10%
So it is a good story.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:36.890 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll continue on
in Turkey in a moment.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.630 align:middle line:84%
But we're kind of
switching back and forth

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.840 align:middle line:84%
because the times we're in are
these chaotic, urgent times

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.820 align:middle line:84%
and we have forgotten our
connection with the land.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:49.630 align:middle line:90%
We've forgotten.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:53.142 align:middle line:10%
Now, if all of a sudden we
had some kind of power grid

00:10:53.142 --> 00:10:54.600 align:middle line:10%
outage or whatever
and you couldn't

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.490 align:middle line:10%
rely on the normal
things, streams

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.740 align:middle line:10%
of goods that we get
in life, most of us

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.360 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't have a clue as
how to live with the land,

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.540 align:middle line:10%
or from the land, or
how the land could help,

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.060 align:middle line:10%
what it has to offer that we
could heal ourselves with.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.323 align:middle line:90%
We have no clue anymore.

00:11:08.323 --> 00:11:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yes, that's correct.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think we forget, our
civilization depends on farming,

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.330 align:middle line:90%
same as it always has.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And when I think of how
my grandparents lived,

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.450 align:middle line:84%
how they lived through
the Depression,

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:25.650 align:middle line:84%
they lived through it because
they were kind of farmers too.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:28.170 align:middle line:84%
They grew a lot of
food of their own.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.430 align:middle line:84%
They exchanged it
with their neighbors.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.460 align:middle line:84%
That's how they thrived
in very difficult times.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you live
in a city or a suburb

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and you get all your food from
the supermarket, you can forget.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.150 align:middle line:84%
We depend on the land,
we depend on our farmers,

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.160 align:middle line:90%
we depend on the weather.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.440 align:middle line:84%
It can all be a bit precarious,
and we easily forget.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And not to say nothing
of all the healing herbs.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Herbs.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:90%
We call them herbs.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking to you,
I'm calling it herbs.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yes.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Understood.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Healing
herbs-- herbs--

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:84%
healing that we have
available to us.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And other than the rare
person here or there

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.720 align:middle line:84%
who has taken the
time to study, we've

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.700 align:middle line:84%
forgotten that we have a
cornucopia of healing plants

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.050 align:middle line:84%
all around us as well that
we've forgotten all about.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: We do.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:16.810 align:middle line:84%
I was saying to
someone just yesterday,

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.830 align:middle line:84%
if I could have my gran back
for a week and take notes,

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.460 align:middle line:84%
I would have a lot
more alternative

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.610 align:middle line:84%
to pills for when I have my
various ailments or whatever.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.410 align:middle line:84%
My gran had all sorts
of natural responses

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.690 align:middle line:84%
to getting stung by something,
injured by something,

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.510 align:middle line:84%
having a headache, an upset
tummy, whatever it is.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:39.220 align:middle line:90%
And she wasn't unusual.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.030 align:middle line:84%
That was just normal
knowledge two generations ago.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And yet we've become
so detached from it.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is very true.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't really
matter who I'm talking to.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Every seer, sayer,
channeler or psychic,

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.760 align:middle line:84%
they're all saying the same
thing, that the answer here now

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.358 align:middle line:90%
is we must return to the land.

00:12:56.358 --> 00:12:58.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, well,
we're not going to have

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:90%
that kind of cataclysm, are we?

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:06.030 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, it creates
that balance in our field.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: It does.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And you say return to
the land, which sounds

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.540 align:middle line:90%
like some huge seismic change.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.540 align:middle line:84%
But for a lot of
people, all that means

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.350 align:middle line:84%
is reconnecting
with your backyard.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Sitting under a tree,
appreciating the tree,

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:19.670 align:middle line:90%
talking to the tree.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yes.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And even in a
small backyard, you

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.320 align:middle line:84%
can produce all kinds of
foods and healing plants.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who I mentioned
in one of my books called Cam.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And he's a guardian of
traditional Hawaiian knowledge,

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.048 align:middle line:90%
and his belief is very strong.

00:13:37.048 --> 00:13:39.340 align:middle line:10%
And you hear this in Shamanic
teaching around the world

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:44.120 align:middle line:10%
that everything you need grows
in your immediate environment,

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.400 align:middle line:10%
and you should expect to
find what you need there.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we're going to
head on back to Turkey.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And Anatolia, the reinvention
of agriculture in Anatolia,

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.440 align:middle line:84%
you said that this was
particularly significant.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.720 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Well, two reasons.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's essential
that unless you have agriculture

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:12.640 align:middle line:84%
that can cultivate
crops, you will not

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.560 align:middle line:90%
have the security to settle.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.680 align:middle line:84%
You will not have
the surpluses that

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.330 align:middle line:84%
mean you can have a
specialized society.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Once you have a
specialized society,

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.180 align:middle line:90%
you can begin to build a city.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
you can trade.

00:14:26.945 --> 00:14:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Then you can trade.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So before civilization
begins to build,

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.350 align:middle line:90%
you need farming to happen.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
vectors pointing

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:41.390 align:middle line:84%
to Anatolia as the place where
farming as we know it began.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I learned this through
my study of ancient texts,

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.160 align:middle line:90%
but also contemporary science.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So it was 1998, I think, that a
team went into Southeast Turkey

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.390 align:middle line:90%
to a place called Kara Dağ.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.340 align:middle line:90%
It was led by Manfred Hoyne.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.730 align:middle line:10%
And he took a team from
the University of Norway

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:06.180 align:middle line:10%
in Ås and the Max Planck
Institute in Cologne, Germany,

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:10.590 align:middle line:10%
and they identified what
appears to be the first farm,

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.630 align:middle line:10%
the first known farm.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And there in that place, very
locally, a family or tribe

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.380 align:middle line:84%
learned how to
adapt 11 naturally

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:84%
occurring plants so that they
could be cultivated as crops.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.910 align:middle line:84%
This is a huge thing because
it involves gene manipulation

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So in Australia, I used
to live on the farm

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle line:84%
where federation
wheat was invented.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.620 align:middle line:10%
So this was the
strain of wheat that

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.190 align:middle line:10%
was created that could grow
in Australia so that we could

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.830 align:middle line:10%
build big cities in Australia.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:50.590 align:middle line:10%
Up until that point, we'd
imported wheat from Europe,

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:10%
and we couldn't get it to
grow and produce harvests

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:10%
because the environment
was so different.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:59.670 align:middle line:10%
William Farrer, with all
the benefits of 19th century

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:05.640 align:middle line:10%
science, took 20 years to work
out how to change European wheat

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.210 align:middle line:10%
into Federation wheat.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:10.510 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, we can
grow our own harvests,

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.180 align:middle line:84%
we can sustain
denser populations,

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.800 align:middle line:90%
we can build the cities up.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.763 align:middle line:90%
It took him 20 years.

00:16:15.763 --> 00:16:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: This family in
Turkey, 10,000 years ago,

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:22.510 align:middle line:84%
did it 11 times over and
invented animal husbandry.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So they might have
had a little bit of help.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.778 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: They may have
had a little help.

00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:28.570 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Did you call
it Federation wheat?

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:29.445 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: That's right.

00:16:29.445 --> 00:16:30.270 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going off
topic for a minute here.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:36.030 align:middle line:84%
So in America, we have very high
levels of gluten intolerance,

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.270 align:middle line:84%
and our red wheat has
high gluten content,

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.890 align:middle line:84%
where the white wheat
of Europe does not.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So people say, oh,
I went on vacation,

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.110 align:middle line:84%
I ate the baguettes in France
and focaccia, I had no problems.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.150 align:middle line:84%
What is your
Federation wheat like?

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Do you know if it's high
or low gluten content?

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: I'm not sure.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.487 align:middle line:90%
I only eat sourdough.

00:16:54.487 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, I love that.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:55.990 align:middle line:90%
Me too.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: You're probably
asking the wrong person.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm just curious.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Sour does starts
breaking down the gluten.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:02.370 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:03.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:04.869 align:middle line:10%
So let's get back
on track again.

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:08.220 align:middle line:84%
You said that some of
these bits of evidence

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.390 align:middle line:84%
were very obvious that
you found in Turkey.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle line:90%
Some not so much.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So what were some
of the surprises

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.180 align:middle line:84%
that you ran into
while you were there?

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Well, when
I went, I knew

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:24.730 align:middle line:84%
that I would hear stories of
this reinvention of agriculture.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I knew I would hear stories
of a reboot of civilization

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:84%
because there are so many
narrative traditions that point

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.720 align:middle line:84%
to Anatolia, what
was ancient Armenia.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.660 align:middle line:10%
So you've got the
Noah story in Genesis

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:42.260 align:middle line:10%
that says it was here in Ararat
that his boat ran aground,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.460 align:middle line:10%
and then he planted the first
vineyard and society got

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.580 align:middle line:10%
going again.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.920 align:middle line:10%
You've got the Sumerian story of
Ziusudra, the Babylonian story

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.980 align:middle line:10%
of Ziusudra.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.420 align:middle line:90%
He landed there.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:90%
He rebooted society there.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Greek, Roman writers
point there and say,

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.530 align:middle line:90%
that's where the Iron Age began.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.430 align:middle line:90%
Go to the 1200s.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Snorri Sturluson.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:09.560 align:middle line:84%
He's the person through whom we
know all the Viking God stories.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:14.050 align:middle line:10%
He said it was from there,
Hay's land, ancient Armenia

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:19.330 align:middle line:10%
that advanced culture
migrated through the Balkans,

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.100 align:middle line:10%
into Northwest Europe,
into Scandinavia,

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.070 align:middle line:10%
with modern capabilities in
terms of agriculture and city

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.870 align:middle line:10%
building.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So you've got all these
vectors pointing there.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So I fully expected
the reboot story.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:38.060 align:middle line:10%
But what surprised me was the
detail of the Urartian story,

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:42.250 align:middle line:10%
because they talked about
where the helpers came from

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:47.330 align:middle line:10%
and exactly what they did
to help us post cataclysm

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.730 align:middle line:10%
to get agriculture going.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.010 align:middle line:10%
And it goes into
very great detail,

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:10%
and they tell a story
of hand pollination

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.080 align:middle line:10%
and cross pollination.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.425 align:middle line:10%
And these are the
symbols that they carved.

00:18:59.425 --> 00:19:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: By the humans?

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:04.043 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Being taught by
the Tengri how to do it.

00:19:04.043 --> 00:19:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Without bees doing
the pollination.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Exactly.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:09.950 align:middle line:84%
So you see that
and you think, oh,

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.360 align:middle line:90%
why are they having to do that?

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.200 align:middle line:84%
The only reason you
have to hand pollinate

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.538 align:middle line:90%
is if by some catastrophe--

00:19:15.538 --> 00:19:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you bees.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: --you've got no
bees, got no flying insects.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.837 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fascinating.

00:19:19.837 --> 00:19:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: So embedded
in that story

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:26.300 align:middle line:84%
is environmental
cataclysm, visitors coming,

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:90%
teaching hand pollination.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:84%
This means they brought
plants from elsewhere.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.910 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
create new strains,

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.340 align:middle line:84%
and they're teaching
the people how to do it.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.800 align:middle line:84%
This is the central story
that keeps repeating.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.620 align:middle line:10%
And I realized as I
kept looking at this

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:10%
that what they were showing
me was lighting the blue touch

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.740 align:middle line:10%
paper of civilization.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.530 align:middle line:84%
That's the significance
of hand pollination.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do you mean
lighting the blue touch paper?

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Because you can't have
civilization without agriculture

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and you can't have
agriculture without plants

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.835 align:middle line:84%
that can thrive,
and to get to that,

00:20:01.835 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:84%
you need the hand
pollination, and that's

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:08.000 align:middle line:84%
what these Tengri were
teaching the people.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.120 align:middle line:84%
That has a lot of implications,
especially as around the planet

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.890 align:middle line:84%
We have a reduction in
certain bee populations.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Exactly.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.120 align:middle line:84%
So I talk about
the Silent Spring.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:25.830 align:middle line:84%
So Rachel Carson in 1962
warned that this would happen,

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.430 align:middle line:84%
that if we continued to
use some of the chemicals

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:31.280 align:middle line:84%
we were using in
farming at that time,

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.150 align:middle line:84%
we could have a
silent spring, which

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.130 align:middle line:84%
means you've got no insects
to do the pollinating,

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.630 align:middle line:90%
you've got no birds.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:40.060 align:middle line:84%
The ecosystem begins
to break down.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.480 align:middle line:84%
You're now eating poisoned food
because of these chemicals.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And the Urartian
story says, this

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:51.180 align:middle line:84%
happened before, but not because
of petrochemicals, but because

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:90%
of an Ice Age.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, that gives us
some food for thought.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:57.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:58.450 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:02.710 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to move on
to the seal that was found--

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.840 align:middle line:84%
was it-- the Southern
Wall of Temple Mount.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yes.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.057 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
this all about?

00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Oh, this
was so exciting.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.170 align:middle line:90%
This was just last year.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:13.570 align:middle line:84%
While I was writing The
Eden Enigma, this happened.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:17.430 align:middle line:84%
The seal was discovered,
the seal of Yeho'azar.

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And the significance of it is
when we read the Bible today,

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:25.120 align:middle line:84%
we're reading a
story of monotheism.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.670 align:middle line:84%
When we think of Judaism, we
think of monotheistic religion.

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:33.990 align:middle line:84%
But there was a time when
Judaism was not that.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:38.260 align:middle line:10%
So academics will say it
used to be polytheistic.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.080 align:middle line:90%
I would say near miss.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.490 align:middle line:84%
It was actually a
canon of paleocontact.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:48.480 align:middle line:10%
The ancestors of
the Jewish people

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.760 align:middle line:10%
commemorated a whole
range of beings,

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:10%
just like the Urartians did, who
had visited them in the past,

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:58.320 align:middle line:10%
helped them in the past,
some of them exploited them

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.890 align:middle line:10%
in the past, some of them--

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.980 align:middle line:10%
all these beings washing
around in the biblical text.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
a great reform.

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:84%
From the eighth to sixth century
BCE, the stories were retold.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.240 align:middle line:84%
The Bible as we know
it was put together.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.410 align:middle line:10%
There was a ritual reform,
various priesthoods shut down,

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:21.990 align:middle line:10%
temples demolished, and
Judaism was pared down

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:10%
to Yahwist monotheism.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:28.990 align:middle line:84%
But this seal comes from a
time before that had happened.

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And so it belonged
to a Jewish leader

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.920 align:middle line:84%
who would use the seal to
solemnize his documents

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.970 align:middle line:90%
and seal his letters.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And the image on it is of an
Assyrian genie, or an Assyrian

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.620 align:middle line:84%
God, or a Tengri,
to use that word.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And he saw no problem
with using that image.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:55.010 align:middle line:10%
He saw no conflict between
that and his Judaism

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:58.030 align:middle line:10%
because this was
before the reform

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:00.100 align:middle line:10%
when the Jewish
people understood

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.720 align:middle line:10%
that their Elohim,
their advanced beings

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:10%
were all part of this
wider family of beings

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:09.140 align:middle line:10%
whose stories were told in
every culture around the world.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So the seal is a little
window into that ancient time

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.100 align:middle line:84%
before all the modern
boundaries of religion

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.340 align:middle line:84%
that we think of today
when people remembered

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.830 align:middle line:84%
what the Elohim looked like,
what the Anunnaki looked like,

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.515 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
image that he used.

00:23:23.515 --> 00:23:24.787 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fascinating.

00:23:24.787 --> 00:23:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: It was a time
when people remembered

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.090 align:middle line:90%
what the gods looked like.

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you said, I
believe it was the sixth to--

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Eighth to
sixth century BCE.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --where the
structure of the gods

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.545 align:middle line:84%
was narrowed down to essentially
Yahweh in the Hebrew faith.

00:23:43.545 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: That's right.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then it was
narrowed down and around

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.100 align:middle line:90%
the third--

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:49.900 align:middle line:90%
no, no.

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.990 align:middle line:84%
It would have been
the 13th century BCE.

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:57.490 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, it was narrowed
down to the monotheism

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.600 align:middle line:90%
of one god that was the sun.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:10%
So that had already
happened in Egypt,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.070 align:middle line:10%
but it wasn't an ET per se, or
it wasn't an entity with a face.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.510 align:middle line:10%
It was the sun itself,
and then the hierarchy

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:12.610 align:middle line:10%
of the dimensions of the sun.

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: The reforms
in the Jewish faith

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.060 align:middle line:84%
had a huge political
implication,

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.150 align:middle line:90%
just as they did in Egypt.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:19.850 align:middle line:90%
It went down badly.

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:22.090 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: But it was kind
of the other way around

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:25.480 align:middle line:10%
for Judaism because it was a
centralizing of power where

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:30.260 align:middle line:10%
you had one God, one king, one
high priest, one temple, all

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.510 align:middle line:10%
the tithes going
to that one place.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was part of
achieving an easily governed

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.690 align:middle line:90%
theocratic society.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:39.795 align:middle line:90%
That's what they created.

00:24:39.795 --> 00:24:40.595 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:40.595 --> 00:24:42.835 align:middle line:90%
So now let's go to--

00:24:42.835 --> 00:24:44.210 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
go-- because we're

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:49.830 align:middle line:84%
talking about both controlling
and opportunistic gods

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking about those
who came to assist humanity.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:55.490 align:middle line:84%
So one of the stories
that you look into it

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.440 align:middle line:84%
happened in the Hawaiian
culture, the Ahumanu.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.200 align:middle line:90%
Let's go there now.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: The story of the arrival
of the Mo'o, the dragons,

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and the Ahumanu in
the Hawaiian stories

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:11.100 align:middle line:84%
is basically a
story of invasion.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a very ancient
story in which

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:18.060 align:middle line:84%
these beings come and colonize
the lands of their ancestors.

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:22.890 align:middle line:10%
So all traditional ownership
of the land is now irrelevant.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:26.710 align:middle line:10%
The land belongs to
the Mo'o, the Ahumanu,

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:31.360 align:middle line:10%
and it is divided up so that
the place can be managed.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.770 align:middle line:84%
So now people,
just to live, have

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:40.000 align:middle line:84%
to pay rent to the higher
ups just to live on the land.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can create
scarcity, dependence,

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and one way in
which they did this

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.600 align:middle line:90%
was introduce a money system.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.690 align:middle line:10%
So now you need the
money to pay the rents.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:56.320 align:middle line:84%
So instead of working for
yourself or your community,

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.790 align:middle line:84%
you're working for money and the
money is issued by the invaders.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So you're working
for the invaders.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And then the money you're paid
is devalued year after year.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.320 align:middle line:84%
So just to maintain
your standard of living,

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.970 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
work ever harder.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That sounds
familiar right now.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: It sounds familiar.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:18.580 align:middle line:84%
It's an ancient, ancient story,
but when I heard that story,

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:23.020 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh my goodness,
I understand this world.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.790 align:middle line:90%
This is the world we live in.

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of the time when

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.100 align:middle line:84%
we think about ancient
ancestral story,

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.470 align:middle line:84%
we think it's a
story about the past.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:35.430 align:middle line:84%
It's really a lens
to help us understand

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.010 align:middle line:90%
the world in which we live.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And so we're talking about
usurious entities that

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.960 align:middle line:84%
are trying to create structure
and order where they control

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.940 align:middle line:90%
and they gain.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.200 align:middle line:84%
That's what we have
today, basically.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.203 align:middle line:10%
And so that's often
called-- throughout history,

00:26:54.203 --> 00:26:55.620 align:middle line:10%
they're called
the-- and certainly

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:59.640 align:middle line:10%
now, these people are
called the elite, which

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.840 align:middle line:10%
I take great exception to.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:10%
It just burns me when I hear
people calling them the elite

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.290 align:middle line:10%
because they're bottom feeders.

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:11.070 align:middle line:84%
They're feeding off of
the efforts and energy

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.340 align:middle line:90%
of good people.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.370 align:middle line:90%
That's a bottom feeder.

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:90%


00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Why did we start calling them
the elite instead of predators?

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.850 align:middle line:90%
They're predators.

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Well, I think
because the invaders become

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:31.040 align:middle line:84%
the department of education, and
they call themselves the elite.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.210 align:middle line:84%
I would give the story of
Ghana as an example of this

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:35.930 align:middle line:90%
because this is my family story.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:39.490 align:middle line:84%
So my family on my father's
father's side is Ghanaian.

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:45.280 align:middle line:84%
From the 1820s on until 1950,
Britain sort of took control

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.480 align:middle line:90%
of Ghana.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.520 align:middle line:90%
And the way it was framed--

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.340 align:middle line:84%
obviously, they went in because
they had a lot of weaponry

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and they said, we can defend
you against your enemies.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:56.560 align:middle line:10%
Oh, thank you, says
Ghana, and bit by bit

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:10%
discovers the British are
there for the British,

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.500 align:middle line:10%
not for the Ghanaians.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.520 align:middle line:84%
But the story runs that
obviously, the British

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.290 align:middle line:84%
are superior, they are
more sophisticated,

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.230 align:middle line:84%
they're running
the show, they're

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.910 align:middle line:84%
running the legal system,
they're running the banks,

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:13.000 align:middle line:84%
they're running the
schools and if you

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.680 align:middle line:84%
want to progress
in British Ghana,

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.210 align:middle line:84%
then start dressing
British, start speaking

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:20.710 align:middle line:90%
the Queen's English.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of Ghanaian
people for a long time

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.590 align:middle line:84%
bought into that,
where they were

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:32.060 align:middle line:84%
made to feel inferior and
regard the British as the elite

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.230 align:middle line:84%
because that was the
story the British told.

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.120 align:middle line:84%
You can look at any
invasion all over the world.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.340 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
pattern everywhere.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think we need to
take our power back and stop

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:46.020 align:middle line:84%
calling these usurious
factions the elite.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:46.820 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.350 align:middle line:90%
They're users and controllers.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: I agree.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:49.877 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're predators.

00:28:49.877 --> 00:28:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: A great
shortcut to doing

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.750 align:middle line:90%
that is Jim Henson's movie.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.885 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: The Dark Crystal,
when I watched this movie--

00:28:57.885 --> 00:28:59.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You're
talking about Muppets?

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yeah.

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:01.450 align:middle line:90%
It is Muppets.

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, oh,
this is a fun kids movie.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.400 align:middle line:90%
I like Muppets.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And the story runs that this
land has been invaded and taken

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:14.710 align:middle line:84%
over by very long
lived beings who

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:20.080 align:middle line:84%
were ugly bird people,
very much like the Ahumanu

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.360 align:middle line:90%
in the Hawaiian story.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And they predate upon the
innocent, childlike gelflings.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And they'll often capture
them, terrorize them,

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll
extract the essence

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:33.380 align:middle line:84%
of the gelflings, which
they feed on so they

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.280 align:middle line:90%
can carry on living long.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, I watched this as a
kids movie long time ago.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.092 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm realizing that's
actually our world.

00:29:42.092 --> 00:29:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Jim Henson
was on to something.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: He's telling us
the truth about our world.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:50.390 align:middle line:84%
But when you see it that way
and you see the silly ugly bird

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:53.120 align:middle line:84%
people, you wouldn't
call them elite.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.840 align:middle line:84%
You'd say they were
the evil beings.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Watch that movie and
it will just refresh.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.800 align:middle line:84%
You will never talk
about the elite

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.880 align:middle line:84%
again after you've
watched The Dark Crystal.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:03.480 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.940 align:middle line:90%
The Dark Crystal, Jim Henson.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: We'll call
them the bird people.

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The bird people.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:07.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.863 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll probably still
call them bottom feeders

00:30:09.863 --> 00:30:10.730 align:middle line:90%
or predators, but--

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Fair enough.

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:16.510 align:middle line:84%
So right now, as the structures
and our government, which all

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:17.310 align:middle line:90%
governments--

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:19.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the time is up.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:23.670 align:middle line:84%
The old post-industrial
era structures

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.120 align:middle line:84%
need to fall down now because
they've outlived their function

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.220 align:middle line:84%
and usefulness, and too many
people were used as fodder.

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.580 align:middle line:10%
It really was in this
elite power structure

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.360 align:middle line:10%
that these systems
were designed,

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:38.230 align:middle line:10%
including our educational
systems, our medical systems.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.360 align:middle line:10%
So I think we're all
on the same page.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.350 align:middle line:10%
These systems have to
transform, and it's

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:48.010 align:middle line:10%
going to happen probably
in a very chaotic way.

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:49.524 align:middle line:90%
We're seeing it already.

00:30:49.524 --> 00:30:50.324 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:50.324 --> 00:30:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So you tell a
story, and I believe

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.870 align:middle line:84%
it was in your previous
book, the Invasion of Eden,

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:56.670 align:middle line:90%
is that correct?

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yes.

00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --about the ancient
city and history of-- it's

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:01.520 align:middle line:90%
called Val Gardena?

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Oh, yes.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Val Gardena in Italy.

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:05.590 align:middle line:90%
And I was fascinated by that.

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little bit
about what happened there

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and why that's at all
relevant in today's world,

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.750 align:middle line:84%
where we're going
through this rapid change

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and destruction of systems
so that we can transform.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: It's an amazing story.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:middle line:84%
When I went there, I
was on a skiing holiday.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was a present
from a friend of mine.

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:28.060 align:middle line:84%
He realized I needed some stress
relief, I needed a holiday.

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Very generously invited
me out to this place,

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:34.230 align:middle line:84%
the town of Ortisei, in
the District of Val Gardena

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:35.800 align:middle line:90%
in the Italian Tyrol.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.280 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely beautiful place.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.290 align:middle line:10%
As I walked around
the streets, I

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:43.170 align:middle line:10%
worked out, first of all,
the language spoken there

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:46.110 align:middle line:10%
isn't Italian, it's German.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:49.200 align:middle line:84%
But then, looking on the
street signs and the signage

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.260 align:middle line:84%
at the shops, there
were three languages--

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:56.080 align:middle line:84%
German, Italian, and
this other language.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.990 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
it was, but somehow I

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:00.840 align:middle line:84%
could work out what it meant,
and I couldn't work out

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.088 align:middle line:90%
how I could do that.

00:32:02.088 --> 00:32:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
tell everybody first,

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.320 align:middle line:90%
you speak a number of languages.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:05.890 align:middle line:90%
You're a linguist.

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:08.340 align:middle line:84%
You've had to do a lot of this
in biblical interpretations

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.150 align:middle line:90%
and far beyond.

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yes.

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You speak something
like six languages, as I recall.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.287 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Something like that.

00:32:13.287 --> 00:32:15.973 align:middle line:84%
I need to work on them to get
fluent, but they're all there.

00:32:15.973 --> 00:32:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're all there.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Somewhere in brain.

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
facile with languages.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:20.600 align:middle line:90%
So let's go ahead.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: That's right.

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: But I was
still thinking,

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:25.100 align:middle line:84%
how do I know what
those words mean?

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: And then my
guide, Jana said, Paul,

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.010 align:middle line:90%
did you do Latin at school?

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes, three
painful years of Latin.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:36.200 align:middle line:84%
She said, that's why you
can read those signs,

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.990 align:middle line:84%
because the local
language is Ladin.

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ladin.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Ladin with a D.
It's the closest living

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.050 align:middle line:90%
descendant of Latin.

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we speak that
here is that 2000 years ago,

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.540 align:middle line:84%
nearly, the Roman
army was installed

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:53.840 align:middle line:90%
here, a whole division.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.440 align:middle line:10%
The bulk of the
local population was

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.440 align:middle line:10%
the Roman army speaking Latin.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.890 align:middle line:10%
And then, of course, Rome
moved its capital East.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.930 align:middle line:84%
This happened after a
long time of dis-investing

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:10.490 align:middle line:90%
in its Western territories.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And so what that meant was
public service was gutted,

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:16.550 align:middle line:90%
which might sound familiar.

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:18.650 align:middle line:84%
They stopped investing
in the roads.

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:20.750 align:middle line:84%
They stopped building
amphitheaters.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:24.770 align:middle line:84%
People were being taxed and
getting no benefit from it.

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And then finally,
the capital moves

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.570 align:middle line:90%
and then they recall the Army.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:34.210 align:middle line:10%
So the Army, almost the whole
population of this district,

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:37.990 align:middle line:10%
were being told now have
to move to Constantinople

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:40.360 align:middle line:10%
and continue serving
this empire that

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.050 align:middle line:10%
couldn't care less about you.

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:43.690 align:middle line:10%
You'll be living in
a foreign country

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:45.700 align:middle line:10%
and you'll thank us for it.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:50.288 align:middle line:10%
And the local population of Val
Gardena said, we're not going.

00:33:50.288 --> 00:33:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And they were gutted.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.140 align:middle line:84%
The services were gutted, but
they said, we're staying here.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: We're staying here,
because it is a beautiful place

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and we have no interest
in Constantinople,

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:05.380 align:middle line:84%
and we think we can carry on
living here, serving each other.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Instead of siphoning
all our wealth

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.040 align:middle line:84%
to Rome and now
to Constantinople,

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.719 align:middle line:90%
we will farm for each other.

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:14.489 align:middle line:84%
We will make and sell
things to each other.

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:17.730 align:middle line:10%
We will become a
self-sufficient community.

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:19.860 align:middle line:10%
We can trade with our neighbors.

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.300 align:middle line:10%
We'll make a go of it.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.500 align:middle line:10%
And they did and that's why
all this time later, they're

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.540 align:middle line:10%
still living there, still
speaking Latin, basically.

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's still a
thriving community?

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Oh, still a
thriving community.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:33.982 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And my
understanding is that they

00:34:33.982 --> 00:34:35.050 align:middle line:90%
invested in everything.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:35.850 align:middle line:90%
Arts.

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:39.480 align:middle line:84%
They supported every
expression of their citizenry,

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.070 align:middle line:90%
which we don't do anymore.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: And now they've got
tourism and skiing as well.

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:46.290 align:middle line:84%
So they did well out
of that decision.

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:50.449 align:middle line:84%
But I find it an inspiring
story because we're

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:53.760 align:middle line:84%
in a period where our
empires are not serving us,

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.790 align:middle line:84%
where our tax dollars
are being taken

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and we're not
being looked after.

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And we may need to discover more
local expressions of economy

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.740 align:middle line:84%
and more local expressions of
community than we have before.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think we
can still do that.

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:12.850 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, it doesn't matter
what government is doing.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Local communities
still exist and we

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.020 align:middle line:90%
can look after each other.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give a
couple of examples.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Please
do, because this

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.410 align:middle line:84%
is something that's taking
hold on a grassroots level

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and popping up in little
communities around the world.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:26.470 align:middle line:90%
Just starting though.

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yes.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:29.170 align:middle line:90%
So take farms.

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:32.320 align:middle line:84%
We were talking before about
taking our farms for granted.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.360 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our farms are very
dependent on the big structures

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.420 align:middle line:84%
of supermarkets,
and often that's

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.880 align:middle line:90%
multinational corporations.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And the supermarkets
can in an instant say,

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.700 align:middle line:84%
we don't want your
harvest anymore,

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:51.040 align:middle line:84%
or we'll pay half of
what we paid last year.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.310 align:middle line:10%
And that's a disaster.

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:56.710 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a panacea, it
won't work for every farm,

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:57.853 align:middle line:90%
but there are places--

00:35:57.853 --> 00:35:59.770 align:middle line:84%
I know this has happened
in the United States,

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:03.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's happened in Australia,
where a farmer has found itself

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.130 align:middle line:84%
in that kind of trouble,
or a network of farms,

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and so the local towns then
become their customers.

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:14.100 align:middle line:10%
And there are places where
you can pay your farm a fixed

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:17.460 align:middle line:10%
amount of money every
week, and every week you

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.470 align:middle line:10%
get a food package from them.

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:21.312 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be a
different food package.

00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Community-supported
agriculture

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:24.437 align:middle line:84%
I think it's called
in California.

00:36:24.437 --> 00:36:25.330 align:middle line:90%
CSAs.

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: So we've gone back to an
older pattern, a smaller scale

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:33.040 align:middle line:84%
economy where the town is
the customer of the farm

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.550 align:middle line:84%
and we support each other and
we can make a go of it together.

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:38.740 align:middle line:90%
So we can do that on that level.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:42.760 align:middle line:10%
And I think, again, we shouldn't
see it as a retrograde step.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.880 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
wonderful and human way

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.140 align:middle line:84%
of living and
appreciating one another.

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:49.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a new expression
of harmony.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:54.070 align:middle line:84%
We already know that
big agriculture--

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:57.300 align:middle line:84%
some people can't afford
to buy organic food

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.040 align:middle line:84%
because it's not equal
here in the United States.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not like what
Prince Charles in the day

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:05.290 align:middle line:84%
did to equalize the prices
of organic and non-organic

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:06.090 align:middle line:90%
in England.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.140 align:middle line:84%
That was one of his
great contributions.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:09.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't have that
in the United States.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.190 align:middle line:10%
So you have to have a
little higher income

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:15.320 align:middle line:10%
to be able to afford a
healthy, organic diet.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.870 align:middle line:10%
So you're forced
into these foods

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:18.970 align:middle line:10%
where they've used
these awful chemicals.

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:22.820 align:middle line:10%
So I see it as a huge upgrade
if that started breaking down.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: It is an upgrade because
you will get cleaner food.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And of course, some farms get
into trouble in the States

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:32.150 align:middle line:90%
if they're not growing GM crops.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:35.180 align:middle line:84%
But that's not necessarily
what the local towns want.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.330 align:middle line:84%
They're very happy
to eat organic.

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And there are other towns
where the farming is happening

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:45.190 align:middle line:84%
at a micro level, where
you've got networks of homes

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:48.410 align:middle line:84%
with backyards-- so it's
not a rural environment,

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:50.900 align:middle line:84%
but they're all using
their backyards,

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:54.160 align:middle line:84%
getting together to coordinate
who's going to grow what,

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.090 align:middle line:84%
and then they share
it and they thrive.

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then times past.

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.700 align:middle line:84%
100 years ago,
even in Paris, they

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.560 align:middle line:84%
would grow their
vegetables on their roofs

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and on their tiny
little balconies.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.170 align:middle line:90%
There's a way to do this.

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to be beholden
to that big Ag industry, which

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:13.210 align:middle line:84%
I'll be very happy to see
it disrupted personally

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.700 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.110 align:middle line:10%
I've had so much fun talking
with you about all this.

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:19.370 align:middle line:10%
We're almost out of time.

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:22.420 align:middle line:10%
So going back now to
the visitors who have

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:25.060 align:middle line:10%
helped-- the good visitors,
not the controlling ones.

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:27.850 align:middle line:84%
They've left little
kind of breadcrumbs

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:31.390 align:middle line:84%
of evidence of how we can
reach out and how we can--

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:34.010 align:middle line:90%
forget governmental disclosure.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.660 align:middle line:90%
It's already happened, really.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So they've left some
breadcrumbs of how

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.900 align:middle line:84%
we can reach out and
begin communicating

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.740 align:middle line:90%
on a more cosmic level.

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:48.130 align:middle line:84%
You found evidence that they
have left ways to engage.

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: What I saw
the Urartians doing,

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:53.720 align:middle line:84%
they had three
modalities, I believe,

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:57.790 align:middle line:84%
that they used to try
and achieve communication

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.000 align:middle line:84%
with advanced
beings, with Tengri.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.560 align:middle line:90%
One was e-fields.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.280 align:middle line:84%
So their special
sites, where they

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:10.440 align:middle line:84%
built their sanctuaries were on
dense magnetic rock, and then

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.350 align:middle line:84%
there would be water
flowing over that rock.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And human bodies
feel different when

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:18.760 align:middle line:84%
you stand in an e-field
that's created that way.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.230 align:middle line:90%
You just feel more alert.

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.550 align:middle line:90%
You feel more awake.

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:24.070 align:middle line:84%
You're heightened
in some kind of way.

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And then they created
phenomena of light.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And I actually think this
is because they remember--

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:34.560 align:middle line:84%
they tell the stories in their
inscriptions of the Tengri

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.500 align:middle line:84%
coming and going
in beams of light.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.720 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's a memory
of artificial lighting,

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.890 align:middle line:10%
of doors being opened
and then the Tengri

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:46.960 align:middle line:10%
come out of this bright light
and then they go back into it.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.740 align:middle line:84%
So the Urartians thought,
hey, ho, we need that.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:55.110 align:middle line:10%
So they created sanctuaries
facing from west to east.

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And at one place
in particular, all

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:02.770 align:middle line:84%
encased in alabaster so that
it absolutely glows with light.

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:04.780 align:middle line:90%
They're decorated in gold leaf.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:07.470 align:middle line:10%
So they're experiencing
a light phenomenon.

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And they would have found you
feel differently when you're

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:13.750 align:middle line:90%
surrounded by a light that way.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:15.070 align:middle line:90%
It also is elevating.

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: And then
archeologists would

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.440 align:middle line:90%
talk about libation offerings.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.080 align:middle line:84%
What I think was really
happening is they had a drink.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.290 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: A special
drink that they

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:28.620 align:middle line:10%
used to alter their
state of consciousness.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.310 align:middle line:90%
All their neighbors did this.

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:33.520 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks did it with
Kykeon, the Persians did it,

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.800 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians did it,
the Indians did it.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So they're doing these
things and finding

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.130 align:middle line:84%
they're experiencing
an altered state

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:43.720 align:middle line:84%
and they're having
contact experiences.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.233 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I found there.

00:40:45.233 --> 00:40:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's interesting
because that is happening

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.070 align:middle line:90%
in much greater numbers now--

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yes.

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --with or
without the drink.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And I just find it
interesting that in all

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:57.340 align:middle line:84%
these ancient cultures, really
high priority was wine and beer.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:01.320 align:middle line:84%
So we must have needed to
self-soothe from the beginning.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: I think that's
part of the picture too.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But no, this
is really interesting,

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.888 align:middle line:84%
though, because the contact
that we're talking about,

00:41:07.888 --> 00:41:10.300 align:middle line:84%
the help we're looking
for is all around us.

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.420 align:middle line:84%
It's always speaking to
us and calling to us.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: And at a personal
one-on-one level.

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: And I find in
the coaching space,

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm hearing from
people who might not

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:25.120 align:middle line:84%
be using any of those modalities
and yet they will tell me,

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm beginning to
believe I've got

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.040 align:middle line:90%
an invisible team of helpers.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:32.748 align:middle line:84%
I keep getting these thoughts
and ideas and these nudges.

00:41:32.748 --> 00:41:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's not what they've been
taught through their religion.

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:36.957 align:middle line:84%
It's not what they've
learned at school.

00:41:36.957 --> 00:41:39.820 align:middle line:84%
They're just beginning to
recognize what's happening.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:43.650 align:middle line:84%
I find that really encouraging
because we might wonder what

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:46.300 align:middle line:84%
contact is going on
behind closed doors,

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:47.667 align:middle line:90%
but contact is everywhere.

00:41:47.667 --> 00:41:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Contact is everywhere.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.380 align:middle line:90%
That is contact.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.940 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree with you more.

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:55.420 align:middle line:84%
It's lovely to hear that the
people that you're coaching

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.920 align:middle line:84%
are experiencing this
individually, on their own,

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:58.720 align:middle line:90%
with no training.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.680 align:middle line:90%
It's just happening.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yes.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're recognizing
it for what it is.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:03.650 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:04.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Just any final thought
before we say goodbye?

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:07.820 align:middle line:90%
We're out of time.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: I'm going to go
back to Plato because I've

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.660 align:middle line:90%
learned so much from him.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And he just speaks about our
purpose here in this life.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:19.750 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: And his view is
that we as material beings

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:24.740 align:middle line:10%
are here to have experiences,
and we should enjoy having them.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.670 align:middle line:10%
And if we can just
learn to shake off

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:32.000 align:middle line:10%
our heavier emotions, by which
he meant things like anger,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.990 align:middle line:10%
rage, resentment,
unforgiveness, fear, anxiety,

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:38.780 align:middle line:10%
if you can find a way to
shake those off, he says,

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.460 align:middle line:10%
you'll have better experiences.

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Hear, hear.

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: So I think if we're
intentional in that way

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.810 align:middle line:84%
and decide, well,
