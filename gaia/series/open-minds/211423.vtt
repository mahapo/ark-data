00:00:08.438 --> 00:00:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD RUDD: It's called
Gene Keys, because it's all

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.027 align:middle line:90%
wired into our DNA.

00:00:12.027 --> 00:00:13.610 align:middle line:84%
This is actually
talking biology here.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: It's a bit
like opening a safe.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.595 align:middle line:90%
You turn it one way, click.

00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:19.970 align:middle line:84%
You turn it another way,
there's another Gene Key, click.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.845 align:middle line:84%
And then you turn it
another way back, click.

00:00:21.845 --> 00:00:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And you get to the oldest
one, and then the door opens,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.830 align:middle line:84%
and your heart starts to
breathe and live again.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.070 align:middle line:84%
In 1996, I had a huge
series of revelations

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.110 align:middle line:84%
that I've been
unpacking ever since.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a journey you take
through deep contemplation.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And in that process
of contemplation,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:90%
you unlock your own gifts.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.570 align:middle line:90%
You can do it now.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.830 align:middle line:90%
You can do it tomorrow.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:90%
You can keep doing it.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And what you're doing
is you're creating space

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.720 align:middle line:90%
for transformation to occur.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.210 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.790 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: One of the favorite
topics of our community

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.580 align:middle line:10%
is finding new systems
that both divine and make

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:10%
sense of our lives and times.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.960 align:middle line:84%
One of the more elegant
systems is the Gene Keys,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:90%
established by Richard Rudd.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of the
system is that it

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
takes levels of consciousness
into consideration,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.120 align:middle line:84%
which is not the norm in
most divination systems.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:90%
So Richard, let's dive in.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.720 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.550 align:middle line:84%
You and I are friends,
and I know you,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.710 align:middle line:84%
but most of our audience
may be new to you.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Some have already gone
down this rabbit hole.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And it is so beautiful,
so elegant, so complex,

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.370 align:middle line:84%
so we need to let
people get to know

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.030 align:middle line:90%
the fellow that started it all.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: I'm here.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.332 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So why don't
we just dive right in.

00:01:32.332 --> 00:01:33.540 align:middle line:90%
First of all, you're British.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.163 align:middle line:84%
You had a wonderful
upbringing in life,

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:37.830 align:middle line:84%
outside of maybe going
to public school.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Yeah, that was
a little bit more hairy.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe just explain
that, because it's, I think,

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:90%
important for people to know.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:84%
This comes up with some
of my British guests

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:84%
who are well-educated in
that system, it's scary.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Prince Charles, now
King Charles, was--

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Totally.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.710 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --brutalized by it.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.370 align:middle line:10%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.300 align:middle line:10%
No, totally.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.650 align:middle line:10%
You know, I was sent off
at 7 to boarding school.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And that was just a deep trauma
that's lived in me ever since.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:10%
And so in some respects,
a lot of my work

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.870 align:middle line:10%
has actually come
out of that trauma,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.980 align:middle line:10%
and it's been about
healing that trauma.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So it had its purpose, but
it wasn't fun at the time.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I've ever met
a British man that actually

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.740 align:middle line:84%
had a good time at school
when they were sent away

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.920 align:middle line:90%
to public school.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.850 align:middle line:84%
It just seemed
that discipline, I

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:84%
don't know what it was trying
to shape these little boys into,

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.177 align:middle line:84%
but I mean,
bordering on cruelty.

00:02:35.177 --> 00:02:36.468 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Mm-hmm, definitely.

00:02:36.468 --> 00:02:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet, you
have loving parents.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.895 align:middle line:84%
They were doing the
right thing by you.

00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:40.695 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:02:40.695 --> 00:02:42.718 align:middle line:90%
Well, my father went also.

00:02:42.718 --> 00:02:43.885 align:middle line:90%
So that was how it was done.

00:02:43.885 --> 00:02:44.275 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:44.275 --> 00:02:45.205 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: You didn't question it.

00:02:45.205 --> 00:02:46.005 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And so what is the
system built for?

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Well, I think it's
just-- it's what you said.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.510 align:middle line:84%
It's built to shape the
young leaders of the future.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And so that was why
they designed it

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.510 align:middle line:84%
in that way; discipline,
and education, and values.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.725 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they did have good
values, but it was just,

00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:07.600 align:middle line:90%
there was no emotion.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.667 align:middle line:90%
There was no feminine--

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Emotional deprivation.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.420 align:middle line:90%
No feminine.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: No feminine, no.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, well, OK.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.840 align:middle line:90%
So now, you're making up for it.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.145 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: I'm definitely
making up for it.

00:03:15.145 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the Gene
Keys makes up for it.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.862 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:03:16.862 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So let's
go to Gene Keys.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.800 align:middle line:84%
So you're a young
man, and you're also--

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.420 align:middle line:90%
you're searching for something.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
the lead-up to finding

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Human Design and the
structure that gave you.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, before that, I had
this series of visions.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And so that was in the
order of the flow of it.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:90%
That was in 1996.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.385 align:middle line:84%
I had a spiritual
awakening, I guess.

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:40.885 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everyone
says that nowadays.

00:03:40.885 --> 00:03:41.995 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:41.995 --> 00:03:43.695 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Do you want me to
talk about that a little bit?

00:03:43.695 --> 00:03:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
yeah, yeah, please.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: So mine was a bit odd.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Because I woke up in the
morning, out of my bed,

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.940 align:middle line:84%
out of sleep, and I woke
up into a heightened

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.240 align:middle line:90%
state of consciousness.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So I just transitioned from
the dream into the awakening.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.153 align:middle line:84%
And it stayed like that for
three days and three nights.

00:04:03.153 --> 00:04:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked about it
quite a lot here and there.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And I always say the story
gets better every time.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:90%
I throw something new in.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.580 align:middle line:84%
A lot happened in those
three days and three nights.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.630 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't sleep.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:90%
And I was in an altered--

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a fully awakened
state of consciousness

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.810 align:middle line:84%
is how I would refer to it, with
light pouring through my body.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And the light had an
intelligence to it.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't just an experience,
there was an omniscience to it

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:84%
as well, which I
know is a big word.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.520 align:middle line:84%
But I could see things
and remember things.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And I could remember the
future, as well as the past.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So I realized there was a
state out of timelessness

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.780 align:middle line:84%
in which memory travels
in all directions,

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.660 align:middle line:84%
not just as we think it,
linear towards the past.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I had a huge
series of revelations

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.900 align:middle line:84%
that I've been unpacking
ever since, actually.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.233 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So from there--

00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:84%
because this kind of happened
again, but from there,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:90%
what happened?

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And how did you stumble
into Human Design?

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Well, I guess, part of
my process of trying to come

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.250 align:middle line:84%
to terms with that experience
after it ended and I was back

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.190 align:middle line:84%
to being this guy,
the wounded guy from--

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.315 align:middle line:90%
the traumatized young lad--

00:05:19.315 --> 00:05:21.122 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Still at school.

00:05:21.122 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: --I spent a long
time trying to process that

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.190 align:middle line:84%
and trying to work out what
I was supposed to do with it.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.775 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I was given some
complete system like the Gene

00:05:30.775 --> 00:05:31.575 align:middle line:90%
Keys.

00:05:31.575 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any structure.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I had this revelation,
but I had no language for it.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So, I think, I spent most of
my 20s traveling the world,

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.100 align:middle line:84%
studying with
different teachers.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.267 align:middle line:90%
I was lucky I had a little--

00:05:46.267 --> 00:05:51.550 align:middle line:84%
I had just enough inheritance
to be able to be free to travel.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.460 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't very, very
rich, or anything like that.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:84%
But it was just enough so that
I could travel around the world,

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.300 align:middle line:84%
and work here and
there, and just explore

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.210 align:middle line:84%
what I was interested in, after
having had that experience.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And Human Design was
one thing that went off

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.160 align:middle line:90%
in me quite powerfully.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.220 align:middle line:90%


00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.710 align:middle line:84%
The first time I saw one
of those body graphs,

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I had a very profound
moment of memory.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.500 align:middle line:90%
And so I followed that strand.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.700 align:middle line:84%
I ended up in America
with the founder, Ra.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.745 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:25.745 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny, because I know
people in the Human Design

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.245 align:middle line:84%
system who remember
you from back then.

00:06:30.245 --> 00:06:31.045 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Oh, yeah.

00:06:31.045 --> 00:06:32.095 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
when you were a kid.

00:06:32.095 --> 00:06:32.895 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:32.895 --> 00:06:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they said you had
quite a profound understanding

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.815 align:middle line:84%
of Human Design as
well, at the time.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, I did.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I connected well
with Ra, which wasn't

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.410 align:middle line:90%
the case for many people.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, almost no one.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And we had a kind of a quite
a profound intimacy together,

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.520 align:middle line:84%
as much as most people could,
I think, other than his family.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.760 align:middle line:10%
And so, yeah, through that,
he offered me the rights

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle line:10%
to the UK, to do it in the UK.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.180 align:middle line:90%
And so I set up a school.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I set up one of the first
Human Design schools

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.530 align:middle line:90%
and started teaching in the UK.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.708 align:middle line:90%
It was quite successful.

00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:12.500 align:middle line:84%
The first time I'd done
anything like that.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.940 align:middle line:90%
It was completely new.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:90%
No one had a clue what it was.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.150 align:middle line:90%
So it was quite fun.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.000 align:middle line:84%
It was a bit
nerve-racking at times,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.425 align:middle line:90%
because I was just pioneering.

00:07:21.425 --> 00:07:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
were a young fellow.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's interesting,
because his own story was

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.820 align:middle line:84%
similar to yours, where he had
this blasting download that

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.540 align:middle line:84%
lasted for days and just
showed itself architecturally.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing is Human Design

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.070 align:middle line:90%
is very architectural.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Gene Keys is like
an evolution of that

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:84%
into an expanded state of
consciousness and awareness,

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.200 align:middle line:84%
with the levels of
consciousness and the elegance

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.160 align:middle line:84%
of the explanations of these
Keys made very full for us.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.102 align:middle line:84%
You see, both systems are
rooted in the I Ching,

00:08:01.102 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:90%
Chinese I Ching, right?

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I had in my travels
studied with Daoist teachers,

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.580 align:middle line:84%
and particularly, one lovely man
called Hua-Ching Ni, Master Ni.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote one of the
best books still existing

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:90%
on I Ching.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I became
affiliated to him,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.630 align:middle line:84%
and also, Mantak Chia, who
was a very brilliant teacher,

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.600 align:middle line:90%
still is.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I really explored
those modalities.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I brought
something of that

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.110 align:middle line:84%
into Human Design,
especially Master Ni,

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.000 align:middle line:84%
because he carried the
living transmission.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.860 align:middle line:90%
He was an awakened, amazing man.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.230 align:middle line:84%
You'd go and visit
him, and there

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.050 align:middle line:84%
was this kind of golden
glow that just came off him.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And you're just
sitting in his presence

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.010 align:middle line:84%
and all this wisdom
was just emanating.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I kind of
had that experience

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.590 align:middle line:90%
to bring into Human Design.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And it started to
change my understanding

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.400 align:middle line:84%
and change my direction from
Ra's view, which was really

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.700 align:middle line:90%
hard, because he was my mentor.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's a tricky thing when
you go in a different direction

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.100 align:middle line:90%
from your mentor.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very tricky.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.520 align:middle line:90%
How did he navigate that?

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.795 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Well, he was--

00:09:14.795 --> 00:09:16.295 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've never
asked you that.

00:09:16.295 --> 00:09:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: No.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.170 align:middle line:90%
He was an unusual man, Ra.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And his normal way of
falling out with someone

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:28.160 align:middle line:84%
or diverting with someone
was just to chop them off.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't allow
that to happen.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:36.710 align:middle line:84%
I worked really hard to maintain
a graciousness between us.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:40.280 align:middle line:84%
I remember going to visit him
in Ibiza, where he was living,

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.920 align:middle line:84%
carrying this news
that I was leaving

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and I was going off
in a new direction.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.905 align:middle line:90%
He was very gracious, actually.

00:09:46.905 --> 00:09:47.705 align:middle line:90%
And I stayed--

00:09:47.705 --> 00:09:50.247 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he could see
the beauty and the light in you.

00:09:50.247 --> 00:09:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: I think so.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.370 align:middle line:90%
And he had a fondness for me.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.735 align:middle line:84%
I think he was
pissed off, you know.

00:09:54.735 --> 00:09:55.985 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I would guess.

00:09:55.985 --> 00:09:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: And I thought I was--

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.630 align:middle line:84%
I think he assumed I had
gone adrift in some way,

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.870 align:middle line:90%
at some level.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.920 align:middle line:84%
But he kind of loved
me in his own way,

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and so we actually
ended quite well.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.213 align:middle line:84%
And I offered him
the rights back.

00:10:12.213 --> 00:10:13.130 align:middle line:90%
It was a lovely thing.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.960 align:middle line:84%
It was like-- because
I could have sold them

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:90%
for quite a lot of money.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.610 align:middle line:84%
But because he'd given
them to me for free,

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.688 align:middle line:84%
I felt like, here they are, I
want to give them back to you,

00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:23.480 align:middle line:84%
with a recommendation
of another person who

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.355 align:middle line:90%
could take over them.

00:10:24.355 --> 00:10:26.922 align:middle line:90%
So it was a clean closure.

00:10:26.922 --> 00:10:27.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:10:27.755 --> 00:10:31.168 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: And it felt like there
weren't any nasty things left.

00:10:31.168 --> 00:10:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So I was kind of like,
oh, thank God, that.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm so
glad to hear that.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, I know.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I don't
know why I never asked you

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.160 align:middle line:90%
how he responded, yeah.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.180 align:middle line:84%
So, OK, we've got that
part of the story.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.522 align:middle line:84%
So now, more happens, and then
the Gene Keys, the 64 Keys

00:10:43.522 --> 00:10:44.480 align:middle line:90%
themselves are birthed.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.450 align:middle line:90%
So I then started to innovate.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And the main problem I'd
had with the Human Design

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:90%
was the language.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a linguist, I'm a
poet, I studied literature,

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm a lover of
language, and I just

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:84%
found the language locked me
in to a certain tight cast

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.308 align:middle line:90%
and tight way of thinking.

00:11:11.308 --> 00:11:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was saying earlier,

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:84%
it's very architectural
in its design.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.157 align:middle line:90%
It's mechanical almost.

00:11:16.157 --> 00:11:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Yeah, yeah, it was,
but I didn't mind that part.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:84%
It was just that it didn't
feel like it was complete.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:84%
It didn't feel like
it had a language that

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.750 align:middle line:90%
was full spectrum.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.880 align:middle line:90%
And Ra himself wasn't--

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.520 align:middle line:84%
although he surfed the
higher planes at times,

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.070 align:middle line:84%
he wasn't really
enamored of them.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And he had a dark
sense of humor.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:40.150 align:middle line:84%
He used to say things like
it stinks of angels in here.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And so he had that wonderful
dark sense of humor

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.570 align:middle line:84%
that many people came to
appreciate, me included.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:52.110 align:middle line:84%
But after a while, I felt
this needs to go further.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:56.060 align:middle line:84%
So I started to create this new
language, and a new spectrum

00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:01.100 align:middle line:84%
of words that came out of it,
for the 64 archetypes, which

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.890 align:middle line:90%
were laid down from the I Ching.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:08.255 align:middle line:84%
And that language gave birth
to the Gene Keys, essentially.

00:12:08.255 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I said this
when I was introducing you,

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:84%
and what is so unique about
it, in all of these systems,

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.750 align:middle line:84%
they give you a very
direct Key as to the name

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.970 align:middle line:84%
of your particular
personality trait,

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.170 align:middle line:84%
or what your potential
is, and so forth.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:29.810 align:middle line:84%
But the Gene Keys is unique in
that it goes on three levels,

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:31.800 align:middle line:84%
from the Shadow, to the
Gift, to the Siddhi,

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.580 align:middle line:84%
which is what I found so
beautiful and unique about it.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:84%
It requires genuine self-honesty
to work with the Keys.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think if there's ever
a problem with the Keys

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.030 align:middle line:84%
with anyone, it's only when
we're not willing to look at

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.330 align:middle line:84%
and acknowledge,
I'm still living

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.130 align:middle line:84%
the lower end of this particular
element of my character

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:50.930 align:middle line:90%
or being.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:51.838 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Exactly.

00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And that was what the
language is based on.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a lover of
trinities and threes.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So that notion of having
a shadow spectrum so

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:84%
that you could understand
all the wounding patterns,

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.150 align:middle line:84%
and the trauma patterns
that lie in humanity,

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and therefore your
particular ones, that gave

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.110 align:middle line:84%
rise to this sort
of wound map, which

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:18.050 align:middle line:84%
is what you see in some
of the Gene Keys profiles.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.240 align:middle line:90%
And you can track that.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.180 align:middle line:90%
So it's shadow work.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:21.980 align:middle line:90%
It's deep.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.930 align:middle line:90%
It's gritty stuff.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not just like a
nice, fun esoteric system.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.190 align:middle line:90%
It's gritty.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.910 align:middle line:90%
You have to do the work.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But people
that go into it

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.810 align:middle line:84%
have such immense
respect for it,

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.570 align:middle line:84%
because it does require
integrity and honesty.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:39.200 align:middle line:84%
That's all we should be asking
of ourselves to begin with,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.650 align:middle line:84%
is just to show up
naked and honest.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And it can really add
such dimension and depth

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.860 align:middle line:84%
to your understanding of the
times and your own place in it.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Totally.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing for me
was to use it on myself,

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.980 align:middle line:84%
so to understand my own shadow
patterns and my own traumas,

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and use it to bring me
through those patterns.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:84%
So dishonesty was one
of mine, actually.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And I did find deep places
of dishonesty in my being,

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:08.780 align:middle line:90%
in layers.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And as I came to terms
with those places

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.970 align:middle line:84%
of where I was
dishonoring myself,

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:90%
I started to heal my heart.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And then more love
started to come out,

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.480 align:middle line:84%
not just in me, but also
through the language

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.550 align:middle line:90%
and through the system.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I obviously wrote my book out
of that, "The Gene Keys" book,

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.597 align:middle line:90%
which was a huge undertaking.

00:14:30.597 --> 00:14:31.805 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my gosh, a tome.

00:14:31.805 --> 00:14:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:37.640 align:middle line:84%
It's beautiful, because you
don't read it as a book per se.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:84%
You dive into your
Keys, and then

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.510 align:middle line:84%
your friends' or
your children's.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And you ultimately
gather the knowledge

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.460 align:middle line:84%
through reflection of yourself
and the ones you love.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.130 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting you say
that, because one of mine--

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and at the time I thought, I
wonder where that's showing up,

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.210 align:middle line:90%
you know--

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.035 align:middle line:90%
it was deafness.

00:14:54.035 --> 00:14:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, of course.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
very recently begun

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.250 align:middle line:84%
to understand how deaf I've
been in certain areas of life

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.290 align:middle line:90%
and why.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, it was very helpful
to reflect back, wait a minute,

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.530 align:middle line:84%
and go into it, because now,
I can heal it going forward.

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.305 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into
the Keys themselves.

00:15:12.305 --> 00:15:12.695 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Sure.

00:15:12.695 --> 00:15:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so we
talked about that.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.675 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
show a chart here,

00:15:15.675 --> 00:15:18.300 align:middle line:84%
so people can kind of
see what this looks like.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, there
are different pathways.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say this,
this is very cool.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.457 align:middle line:84%
Anyone can go to genekeys.com
right now, while you're

00:15:27.457 --> 00:15:28.332 align:middle line:90%
watching this, right?

00:15:28.332 --> 00:15:29.132 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Mm-hmm.

00:15:29.132 --> 00:15:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Pause, do a
pause, go to genekeys.com,

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.250 align:middle line:90%
and you'll see FREE PROFILE.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Click on the FREE PROFILE--
it's just like entering

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.190 align:middle line:84%
your information for
an astrological chart--

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and let it pop up, so
you can see what it

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.120 align:middle line:90%
looks like on your own chart.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And you can go along
with Richard and I

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:84%
as he's talking about
these pathways, OK?

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Great.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.855 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's assume
most everybody has downloaded

00:15:50.855 --> 00:15:54.110 align:middle line:84%
it, and they're taking a peek at
their own as they're listening.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:57.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's start with
the first page that

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.310 align:middle line:84%
gives your primary three
Keys on the three pathways.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about what
those three Keys are?

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yes.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.632 align:middle line:90%
It's four Keys, three pathways.

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Three
pathways, four Keys, yes.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Yeah, they're
called your life's work,

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.380 align:middle line:84%
your evolution, your
radiance, and your purpose.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And those who know Human
Design will recognize them

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.610 align:middle line:84%
from what's called the
incarnation cross, which is--

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.970 align:middle line:84%
they're the archetypes of
what you're here to do,

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:84%
and your deep core
purpose in life, and how

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.950 align:middle line:84%
you get in the
way of it, how you

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:32.520 align:middle line:84%
open up the genius in your life
and find that higher purpose.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.850 align:middle line:90%
And so there's simple pathways.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:35.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a simple process.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.160 align:middle line:90%
It's universal.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.100 align:middle line:84%
It's Challenge, that's the
first pathway, Breakthrough,

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.840 align:middle line:90%
and there's Core Stability.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And so as you go into a
contemplation of these codes,

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.020 align:middle line:84%
of your Keys, you meet
the Challenge first.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And the Challenge is, like,
what is the greatest challenge

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:90%
in my life?

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.245 align:middle line:84%
So you can look at the one that
says Evolution, for example,

00:16:55.245 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle line:84%
and you can look at the
shadow pattern there.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that's
probably one of the biggest

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.000 align:middle line:90%
challenges in your life.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.090 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's doubt,
right-- self-doubt.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I've had to
really understand

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.685 align:middle line:90%
where that doubt comes from.

00:17:07.685 --> 00:17:10.060 align:middle line:84%
But then there's a gift in
every one of those challenges,

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.150 align:middle line:84%
so you have to look at, well,
what's the next word up.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
go with your doubt--

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.465 align:middle line:84%
the Key, and your
doubt, and what that is.

00:17:15.465 --> 00:17:16.265 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:17:16.265 --> 00:17:18.599 align:middle line:84%
So the gift in doubt
is inquiry, right?

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:21.750 align:middle line:84%
So doubt is a
fundamental basis of--

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.240 align:middle line:84%
like the scientific
process, right?

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.640 align:middle line:84%
You begin with, like, I
don't know how this works.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's take it apart and
figure out how it works.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.397 align:middle line:84%
So for me, that's been like,
I've got to understand myself.

00:17:33.397 --> 00:17:34.980 align:middle line:84%
I've got to understand
how this works.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.105 align:middle line:84%
I've got to understand how
these Gene Keys operate.

00:17:37.105 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So I took them
apart inside myself.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
to find the gift.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a great
inquirer, you know.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of my
prime gifts is inquiry

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.690 align:middle line:90%
into the depth of things.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And then even deeper is
what we call the Siddhi.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:56.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the Gift in its
ultimate flowering.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.390 align:middle line:90%
Siddhi is a Sanskrit word.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.690 align:middle line:84%
There's no English word, so I
had to borrow it from Sanskrit.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Siddhi, divine power in a way,
or enlightened self-expression,

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.540 align:middle line:90%
or superpower, if you like.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.710 align:middle line:90%
What's your superpower?

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:11.960 align:middle line:84%
So you can look at
those Siddhis and you'll

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.250 align:middle line:90%
see your superpowers.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.625 align:middle line:90%
And for me--

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it's
the superpower there.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:15.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:18.050 align:middle line:90%
So doubt, inquiry, truth.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Truth-- Truth with a
capital T. And Truth,

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.470 align:middle line:84%
it's not just
speaking the truth,

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:84%
it's truth as an experience,
as an embodied experience.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So that Truth for
me is what I felt

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:84%
in my three-day
experience, for example.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.870 align:middle line:84%
I experienced the
embodiment of Truth.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:36.890 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond words.

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:38.150 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond understanding.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.430 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you
what it felt like.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:41.593 align:middle line:90%
It's just, I knew stuff.

00:18:41.593 --> 00:18:42.635 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You knew stuff.

00:18:42.635 --> 00:18:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.213 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, what Key is that?

00:18:44.213 --> 00:18:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: That's 63.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:47.847 align:middle line:84%
And there are 64
Keys, as you say.

00:18:47.847 --> 00:18:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: There are 64, yeah.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:53.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's an example of
how to unlock your profile.

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you open up
these breakthroughs.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the thing is the
way you have it set up there,

00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.340 align:middle line:90%
you can--

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.670 align:middle line:84%
so if you happen to have
the book, the tome, right,

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:04.920 align:middle line:84%
"The Gene Keys," the
codes to everything,

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.680 align:middle line:84%
that gives these beautiful
explanations on all three

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.510 align:middle line:90%
levels of each Key.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So what you would
do is you would

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.590 align:middle line:84%
look at these initial paragraphs
that encapsulate that,

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and then you can go
dive down into it

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.165 align:middle line:84%
and see where you are in it
on a level of consciousness.

00:19:21.165 --> 00:19:23.145 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Yeah, the
paragraphs are just teasers.

00:19:23.145 --> 00:19:24.645 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
teasers, but they're good.

00:19:24.645 --> 00:19:25.445 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:19:25.445 --> 00:19:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they're teasers to get
you to unlock your imagination.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:33.350 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, Gene Keys
doesn't do it for you.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:37.095 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.095 --> 00:19:39.780 align:middle line:84%
I call it a path of
self-illumination.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a journey you take
through deep contemplation.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And in that process
of contemplation,

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.430 align:middle line:90%
you unlock your own gifts.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.400 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it for you.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
found it right on.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.930 align:middle line:84%
The first time I did it, I
looked at it and I thought,

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.510 align:middle line:84%
oh my gosh, I've got to go
a little deeper into this,

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.720 align:middle line:84%
because each one of
those short paragraphs

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.650 align:middle line:90%
struck a very deep truth in me.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And so for mine, just
to peek at it, Key 49--

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:08.122 align:middle line:84%
yeah, Key 49-- the purpose and
the Key of 49, what is that?

00:20:08.122 --> 00:20:09.330 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us what that is?

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to
do 43, my life's work.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: So 49, the Shadow,
reaction, the Gift, revolution,

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:18.850 align:middle line:90%
and the Siddhi, rebirth.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So you can see the
progression of those words.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're states
of consciousness.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:26.723 align:middle line:90%
So reaction is a victim state.

00:20:26.723 --> 00:20:28.140 align:middle line:84%
All the shadows
are victim states.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.098 align:middle line:90%
They're feedback loops.

00:20:29.098 --> 00:20:32.520 align:middle line:84%
So every time you get caught
in the reactive process,

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.840 align:middle line:90%
you're stuck in it.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And it just goes on
in your relationships,

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.920 align:middle line:90%
and you're stuck in that loop.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And you can't escape
in a way, unless you

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:90%
see the pattern yourself.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you unearth it, and
you start to transform it.

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's a transformational
system, Gene Keys.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.460 align:middle line:90%
So you have to do that work.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.710 align:middle line:84%
You have to do it in
your relationships

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.337 align:middle line:90%
and break out of those patterns.

00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:57.045 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then it
goes to revolution.

00:20:57.045 --> 00:20:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Revolution,
then you start to use--

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.530 align:middle line:84%
the same energy at
a higher frequency

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:05.200 align:middle line:84%
becomes creative
revolution, right?

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.300 align:middle line:84%
So you can then
use it creatively.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And every Gift is basically
a creative impulse that

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:11.920 align:middle line:90%
is released from the Shadow.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So the Shadow
makes us miserable.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:15.730 align:middle line:90%
And it feels bad.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.927 align:middle line:84%
And it affects
our-- you know, it's

00:21:17.927 --> 00:21:21.490 align:middle line:84%
called Gene Keys because
it's all wired into our DNA.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.770 align:middle line:84%
We're actually
talking biology here.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So a shadow pattern is
rooted in our biology.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And so it shuts down
pathways in our brain.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.790 align:middle line:84%
It shuts down the
way we see things,

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:38.060 align:middle line:84%
it makes us feel miserable, it
affects our moods, all of that.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.270 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin to
unlock one of these gifts,

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:44.140 align:middle line:84%
you are re-rooting pathways
and genes, expressions

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:90%
of genes in your actual DNA.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And through that, you start
to release vitality, which

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.030 align:middle line:90%
comes out often as creativity.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, you've got
this creative genius

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.460 align:middle line:84%
that starts to emerge, and
your life starts to pick up.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.400 align:middle line:90%
You feel different.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Your sleep patterns change.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.660 align:middle line:90%
Your dreaming changes.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So many things rooted
in our endocrine system

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.863 align:middle line:84%
change because the genes
are governing all that.

00:22:09.863 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, in the beginning,
when I shared Gene Keys,

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I had this line, I used to
say, you are the architect

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.240 align:middle line:90%
of your evolution.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.472 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:22:16.472 --> 00:22:17.305 align:middle line:90%
And that is so true.

00:22:17.305 --> 00:22:18.763 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: And it's
true, I know that.

00:22:18.763 --> 00:22:20.580 align:middle line:90%
Many people say that nowadays.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's true, and that this is
a living experience of actually

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.965 align:middle line:90%
undergoing that process.

00:22:25.965 --> 00:22:30.820 align:middle line:84%
It's very personal to each
person and very powerful.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So then you have rebirth,
and that's hard to explain.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.050 align:middle line:90%
The Siddhis are hard to explain.

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Often, they come as
epiphanies in our life.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And so as you begin to let that
revolutionary-- like you've

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.800 align:middle line:84%
lived a revolutionary
life, I happen to know.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
have the courage

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.890 align:middle line:84%
to bring that out in a
positive way, then eventually,

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.410 align:middle line:84%
every now and again, there's
a rebirth of some form.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And probably,
something in your life

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:04.065 align:middle line:84%
collapses in order for something
amazingly new to be born.

00:23:04.065 --> 00:23:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, usually,
it all blows up at once,

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.880 align:middle line:84%
in one period of time,
heavy duty stuff at once.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And then boom, there's something
else on the other side.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: So you've just described
the process in every Gene Key.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.875 align:middle line:84%
Because every Gene Key
describes the same process,

00:23:19.875 --> 00:23:21.625 align:middle line:84%
but through slightly
different variations.

00:23:21.625 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
your purpose Key--

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:26.980 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about
your purpose Key,

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.350 align:middle line:84%
because we can see what
you've done with your life.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.020 align:middle line:84%
How is it reflected
in the Gene Keys?

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.670 align:middle line:10%
>>RUDD: My purpose is
the Gene Key of patience.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:37.750 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:42.040 align:middle line:10%
So it's taken me a
long time to get here.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And I've dug very deep
inside my own journey.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And the shadow of
impatience or restlessness

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:59.290 align:middle line:84%
is that energy that just has
undermined me in many ways.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what I was here to do.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.930 align:middle line:84%
But then really
harnessing that patience,

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:09.310 align:middle line:84%
but not as just waiting,
but patience as trust,

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:13.460 align:middle line:84%
trust that it will unfold in
its own timing, everything.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And that if you trust
in that process,

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:90%
then everything's different.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Because then you're
not getting in the way.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.175 align:middle line:84%
You're not trying to
move your life along,

00:24:22.175 --> 00:24:24.550 align:middle line:84%
or you're not trying to think
your way through your life,

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.260 align:middle line:90%
you're allowing it to unravel.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's also the
story of every gift.

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the
Siddhi is timelessness,

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:35.530 align:middle line:84%
so it's about accessing
spaces out of time

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.902 align:middle line:90%
and seeing, understanding--

00:24:37.902 --> 00:24:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
what happened to you--

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:39.655 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Which is
what happened to me.

00:24:39.655 --> 00:24:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --when you were
having your downloads.

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:41.035 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:24:41.035 --> 00:24:41.835 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:41.835 --> 00:24:45.058 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: So purpose is also
different from life's work

00:24:45.058 --> 00:24:46.975 align:middle line:84%
at the top, if you're
looking at your profile.

00:24:46.975 --> 00:24:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:49.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, what's your
life's work then?

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Well, life's work is
63, so that's what I'm doing.

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Life's work is what I'm
doing, sharing the Gene Keys--

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.540 align:middle line:90%
64.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:56.980 align:middle line:90%
So I'm sharing all 64 Keys.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's about imagination
and illumination,

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and so that's what I'm doing,
sharing that, and helping

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.470 align:middle line:84%
people with confusion, because
that's the shadow, hopefully,

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:06.810 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:08.905 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it pervades
everything right now--

00:25:08.905 --> 00:25:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Everything.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:09.595 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --Confusion.

00:25:09.595 --> 00:25:10.105 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:25:10.105 --> 00:25:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: So that's what
you're here to do,

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.870 align:middle line:90%
but your purpose is different.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.630 align:middle line:90%
The purpose is about being.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.390 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's about
a state of being.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Patience is a state of being.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So everything about
these teachings

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:27.310 align:middle line:84%
is about trying to share with
people what I am learning

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and continue to
learn is slow down.

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And when you slow down,
everything comes to you.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.380 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, this
would be a good time

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:10%
to insert in there
your lovely book,

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:37.780 align:middle line:10%
"The Art of Contemplation."

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:38.325 align:middle line:10%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:25:38.325 --> 00:25:39.970 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Because
I love that book.

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:45.790 align:middle line:10%
It is, I think, one of the
more poignant guides to not

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:50.050 align:middle line:10%
only explaining the need
for and the beauty in--

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:53.920 align:middle line:10%
the purpose in slowing
down and taking time,

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.210 align:middle line:10%
taking a lot of time if you
need to, to contemplate each

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.230 align:middle line:10%
of-- like the thing
I was talking about,

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:02.050 align:middle line:10%
deafness, taking time
to just sit with that

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:05.650 align:middle line:10%
and think, why did
you allow yourself not

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:07.430 align:middle line:10%
to see this or hear this.

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And then just-- you don't have
to have the answer immediately.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So "The Art of Contemplation"
is a very beautiful book

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:16.060 align:middle line:84%
to encourage people
to take their time,

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.880 align:middle line:84%
to allow the answers to
bubble up from inside,

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.700 align:middle line:84%
and then they're
genuinely there.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a band-aid answer.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: No.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:27.272 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I wrote "The Gene--"
obviously "The Gene Keys" book

00:26:27.272 --> 00:26:30.460 align:middle line:84%
is like 600 pages, or
something, and it's just dense.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I wrote the little
book on contemplation.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.640 align:middle line:84%
It was to distill
that quintessence

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.340 align:middle line:84%
of what it is that I'm
really trying to share.

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's under 100 pages, and
you can read it in a few hours.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually more proud
of it than the big book,

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.670 align:middle line:90%
because I distilled it.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:49.705 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You distilled
it beautifully.

00:26:49.705 --> 00:26:51.372 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: And I could
only do that after--

00:26:51.372 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:84%
later, when I'd
learned patience and I

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.260 align:middle line:84%
started to realize
how patience operates.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And patience-- one of my
great teachers, he said,

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:02.320 align:middle line:84%
patience is the
vanguard of love.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.062 align:middle line:84%
He's Beinsa Douno,
a Bulgarian sage.

00:27:05.062 --> 00:27:06.145 align:middle line:90%
And I love that statement.

00:27:06.145 --> 00:27:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: My whole life is
wrapped around that statement.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the book is
so fulfilling and soothing.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I've given it as
gifts to people.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.677 align:middle line:90%
It's a slim volume.

00:27:19.677 --> 00:27:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, tiny.

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
but like you said,

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:24.440 align:middle line:84%
you're more proud of
that even than the Keys.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.075 align:middle line:84%
Because right now, the one
thing no one has is patience.

00:27:27.075 --> 00:27:27.875 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: True.

00:27:27.875 --> 00:27:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Society,
the world, everything

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.920 align:middle line:90%
seems to be speeding up.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And we're encouraged through all
of the mechanisms to go faster

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.205 align:middle line:84%
and to think less,
take bite-size pieces.

00:27:37.205 --> 00:27:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.405 align:middle line:84%
And, you know,
this deep wisdom--

00:27:40.405 --> 00:27:41.780 align:middle line:84%
because that's
what Gene Keys is,

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.760 align:middle line:90%
wisdom, rather than knowledge.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Wisdom requires patience.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And it requires
that you do create

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.020 align:middle line:84%
pauses in your life
regularly, which

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.480 align:middle line:84%
is what this "Art of
Contemplation" is all about,

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.980 align:middle line:90%
is the contemplative way.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.180 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can do it.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.840 align:middle line:84%
The moment you read that book,
you can do it immediately.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.440 align:middle line:84%
You can create pauses
in your life so easily.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:90%
You can do it now.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:05.930 align:middle line:90%
You can do it tomorrow.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.070 align:middle line:90%
You can keep doing it.

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:10.170 align:middle line:10%
And what you're doing
is you're creating space

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:12.130 align:middle line:10%
for transformation to occur.

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
create those spaces,

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.455 align:middle line:90%
transformation doesn't occur.

00:28:15.455 --> 00:28:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the higher
voice never comes through.

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:18.888 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult
for it to come.

00:28:18.888 --> 00:28:21.550 align:middle line:84%
It's pounding on the door, but
there's no space to hear it.

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:24.752 align:middle line:84%
And so I recently-- it's
brand-new-- you have an app.

00:28:24.752 --> 00:28:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: We have an app.

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:26.287 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You have a pause app.

00:28:26.287 --> 00:28:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: I'm so excited.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.815 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I just saw it.

00:28:27.815 --> 00:28:28.205 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: It's so cool.

00:28:28.205 --> 00:28:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's amazing.

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you're just
kind of overwhelmed,

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.320 align:middle line:84%
or if you have a little sliver
of time and can slip away,

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.570 align:middle line:84%
go to the little toilet
stall at the office,

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:40.110 align:middle line:84%
if you have to, with
your earbuds in,

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and you can pause for
three minutes, or whatever.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And it gives you all
these different ways

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.535 align:middle line:84%
in which to pause and engage,
whether it's music or tasks.

00:28:48.535 --> 00:28:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: I'm so proud of it.

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:50.460 align:middle line:90%
It's such fun.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.570 align:middle line:90%
It's Triple Flame.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.760 align:middle line:84%
It's called The Triple
Flame, it's on the App Store,

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.840 align:middle line:90%
and it's free.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, it allows you
to pause in a creative way

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.990 align:middle line:84%
every three hours
for three minutes.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can set it, you
can adapt it how you like,

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:05.370 align:middle line:90%
and it gives you a little ding.

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.967 align:middle line:84%
And then it also shows
you how many other people

00:29:07.967 --> 00:29:08.925 align:middle line:90%
are pausing right now--

00:29:08.925 --> 00:29:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: --which
I think is great.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is fun.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.358 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Because then you
have the feeling like you're

00:29:12.358 --> 00:29:13.800 align:middle line:90%
part of a pausing community.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And also, in the
next version, you'll

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.390 align:middle line:84%
be able to see who's pausing
in time zones around the world.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.930 align:middle line:84%
So there'll be, say,
this wave of people

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:24.040 align:middle line:84%
pausing all around the
world for three minutes.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.665 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, you're right, you can
do a little guided meditation.

00:29:26.665 --> 00:29:27.915 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's so sweet.

00:29:27.915 --> 00:29:30.208 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: And you can extend
it for 5 or 10 minutes.

00:29:30.208 --> 00:29:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
beautiful resources in there

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.330 align:middle line:90%
just to kind of chill people.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I was really
impressed when I saw it.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:35.410 align:middle line:90%
It's so fun.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, it is.

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:37.635 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's called
Triple Flame on the App Store.

00:29:37.635 --> 00:29:37.935 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: I really recommend it.

00:29:37.935 --> 00:29:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's free.

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Yeah, free
and it's lovely.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:42.355 align:middle line:84%
It'll change your
life, just like that.

00:29:42.355 --> 00:29:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:43.890 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:46.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to go to one
Key that both you and I

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.620 align:middle line:84%
share, which you can
talk about, which is 56.

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And if people look at the
center of their chart,

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.680 align:middle line:84%
right there, that SQ,
let's talk about our SQ,

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.525 align:middle line:84%
so people can go
look at theirs too.

00:29:57.525 --> 00:29:57.648 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Sure.

00:29:57.648 --> 00:29:58.822 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
our shared SQ.

00:29:58.822 --> 00:29:59.622 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:29:59.622 --> 00:30:01.200 align:middle line:84%
So I should say
before we go there

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:05.350 align:middle line:84%
that working with these
Keys, it takes time.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So I created programs that
guide you through the steps.

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.100 align:middle line:90%
And they're all on my website.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And I really recommend
them, because I

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:18.660 align:middle line:84%
go into the process, the
lines, the Gene Keys.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.273 align:middle line:84%
The programs are
specific to each person.

00:30:21.273 --> 00:30:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to get
into each of those, Activation,

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.140 align:middle line:90%
Venus, Pearl.

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:26.570 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just get into that
Key and then go to the path.

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: So we're jumping right
in the deep end here, SQ,

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:28.725 align:middle line:90%
which--

00:30:28.725 --> 00:30:30.705 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the deep
end, the center of the chart.

00:30:30.705 --> 00:30:31.505 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:30:31.505 --> 00:30:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So your soul's-- you
know, emanation of love,

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:37.285 align:middle line:90%
that's really what that Key is.

00:30:37.285 --> 00:30:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The SQ is
spiritual quotient.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Spiritual
quotient, yeah.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:41.310 align:middle line:90%
It's about your soul.

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like what is your
soul here to communicate

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:46.050 align:middle line:90%
to the world, your heart.

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And so it shows you
the style of love that

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:54.360 align:middle line:90%
is most natural to you, right?

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.210 align:middle line:90%
So you're 56.

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm the same as you.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.405 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: We're both 56.

00:30:57.405 --> 00:30:57.855 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:57.855 --> 00:30:59.025 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: So when you look at--

00:30:59.025 --> 00:30:59.212 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 56.6.

00:30:59.212 --> 00:31:00.012 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:31:00.012 --> 00:31:01.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's a rascally
one, you know.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we're rascals,
that's why we get on.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And every Key, I should
say, you could relate it

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.540 align:middle line:84%
to a deity from different
pantheons around the world.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.670 align:middle line:90%
And so the 56 are the--

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It could
be Pan or something.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:13.983 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Yeah, they're
the naughty gods.

00:31:13.983 --> 00:31:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]
They're the naughty gods.

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: They're
the naughty deities

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:20.100 align:middle line:84%
that-- because it's
about intoxication.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:23.220 align:middle line:90%
It's the intoxicated God state.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:28.553 align:middle line:84%
And so it's-- you know, we
love being involved in--

00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:29.970 align:middle line:84%
that's the kind
of love that wants

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:32.460 align:middle line:84%
to get involved in the
things of the world,

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.710 align:middle line:84%
rather than transcend
and go-- it's like,

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:38.010 align:middle line:84%
I want to transcend through
eating really fine food

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:39.240 align:middle line:90%
and through drinking wine.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.948 align:middle line:84%
There's so many layers
in it that's true.

00:31:40.948 --> 00:31:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we have the
rascally one of intoxication

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.410 align:middle line:84%
in the world, which
really is about love

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:47.940 align:middle line:90%
and sharing with other people.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Totally.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now,
we look at it--

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.325 align:middle line:84%
we've taken a dive into
some of the specific Keys

00:31:53.325 --> 00:31:54.450 align:middle line:90%
to see what they feel like.

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:54.795 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:31:54.795 --> 00:31:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, we go to
the paths themselves.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.310 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
the path of Activation,

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:01.560 align:middle line:84%
and just give us an
idea of what that is.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a book for
each one of these paths.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:09.890 align:middle line:10%
And also, you have an audio
course, video and audio,

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:11.030 align:middle line:10%
that's really beautiful.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:14.750 align:middle line:10%
Because the way you write
about it is in one language.

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:17.930 align:middle line:84%
The way you speak
it is in another.

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And I found out
last night that you

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.890 align:middle line:90%
have a book called "The 64--"

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:22.745 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Ways.

00:32:22.745 --> 00:32:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --Ways" that
is a transcription

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.770 align:middle line:90%
of the way you speak about it.

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:28.583 align:middle line:84%
So depending on how a
person's brain operates,

00:32:28.583 --> 00:32:29.750 align:middle line:90%
they can read it either way.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Exactly.

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:32.150 align:middle line:90%
So I'm from the--

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:33.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Celt, really.

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:34.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm Celtic.

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:35.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Brit.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And so the tradition of oral
poetics is where I come from,

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.950 align:middle line:90%
so I wanted to read it--

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:45.200 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to write it, and
then I wanted to speak it.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And it did come out
completely differently.

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So it took me three
years to record

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.140 align:middle line:90%
all those audios, 64 of them.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that was amazing.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: And I should say, if you
subscribe to our "Pulse," which

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.390 align:middle line:84%
is our love letter to
our community every week,

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:01.370 align:middle line:90%
you get one of those each.

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:04.040 align:middle line:84%
It's the Key of
the moment passing.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:08.000 align:middle line:84%
So you get my audio for free
in the "Pulse" every week.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.090 align:middle line:90%
It's very popular now.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:10.500 align:middle line:90%
People love it.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So you get to read the energy
of the Gene Key of the week

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:15.035 align:middle line:90%
as it's transiting through.

00:33:15.035 --> 00:33:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, again, each
of these is separate books.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Each of them is an audio course
you can take at your own speed.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.115 align:middle line:84%
So what is the
path of Activation.

00:33:23.115 --> 00:33:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: The
Activation sequence--

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:26.550 align:middle line:84%
it's about sequences,
as they're called.

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And we unravel, we
open in sequence.

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about
the mind, the mind

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:35.910 align:middle line:90%
can open quite quickly.

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But the heart, it
needs to open gently.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:41.610 align:middle line:90%
We're dealing with trauma.

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:45.430 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with wounding in
this program, in this process.

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So doing things step
by step in a gentle way

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.630 align:middle line:84%
is what allows us
to feel safe enough

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:53.140 align:middle line:90%
to then start opening up.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you're working with
Gene Keys and these sequences,

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.030 align:middle line:90%
it's in your life.

00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:59.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're doing
it in a corner, in a book,

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.540 align:middle line:90%
it's in your life.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:01.590 align:middle line:90%
You know this, right?

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.725 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:01.725 --> 00:34:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: So you start getting
reflections in your life.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And you see the shadows
through your relationships.

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:09.150 align:middle line:84%
It might be in other
people coming at you.

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So you get to do the
work in your life.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And the Activation sequence is
the first one that-- as I said,

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:18.000 align:middle line:84%
it gives you the
breakthroughs so that you

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.400 align:middle line:90%
can realize this stuff works.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Core
Stability is called.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Every time you have
a breakthrough,

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:28.050 align:middle line:84%
you feel more stable
inside yourself.

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:30.719 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite hard
to explain to someone

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:33.385 align:middle line:84%
who's outside the
system, the programs.

00:34:33.385 --> 00:34:34.185 align:middle line:90%
Because only once--

00:34:34.185 --> 00:34:36.239 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's really the
contemplation that takes you

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:37.274 align:middle line:90%
from the Shadow to the Gift.

00:34:37.274 --> 00:34:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Exactly,
it's transformation.

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:39.727 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
you go into it,

00:34:39.727 --> 00:34:41.969 align:middle line:84%
and you allow yourself to
have the experience of it.

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:42.769 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:42.769 --> 00:34:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: So once you've
had one of those events,

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.230 align:middle line:90%
you're like, aah, I get it.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, I see what
he's talking about.

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:50.400 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.280 align:middle line:90%
It's an actual biological event.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's what makes us
start to feel stable.

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
mean by Core Stability

00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.700 align:middle line:90%
in that first sequence.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:00.230 align:middle line:90%
It's really powerful.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.438 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then the next
one is the path of Venus,

00:35:02.438 --> 00:35:05.190 align:middle line:84%
or the Venus sequence,
which has to do with love

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:07.330 align:middle line:84%
and all its expressions
in our lives,

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:10.730 align:middle line:84%
which is a really powerful
sequence, obviously.

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Yeah, it's
the deepest work

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:18.100 align:middle line:84%
that you can do with any of
the Gene Keys, I would say.

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's heavy stuff.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.020 align:middle line:90%
It's deep.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.300 align:middle line:84%
You need support, because
you're going to go

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.370 align:middle line:90%
into this map of your wounding.

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to show you
specific shadow patterns that

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:32.690 align:middle line:84%
occurred at times in your
childhood in sequence,

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and how you shut down,
and which Keys you used

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.190 align:middle line:84%
in-- because they're
part of who you are--

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:43.160 align:middle line:84%
in order to defend
your heart from hurt.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And so going backwards
through those sequence

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:48.410 align:middle line:90%
is a bit like opening a safe.

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.535 align:middle line:90%
You turn it one way, click.

00:35:50.535 --> 00:35:52.910 align:middle line:84%
You turn it another way,
there's another Gene Key, click.

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:54.785 align:middle line:84%
And then you turn it
another way back, click.

00:35:54.785 --> 00:35:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And you get to the oldest
one, and then the door opens,

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and your heart starts to
breathe and live again.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's really powerful.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.180 align:middle line:84%
So working with that
sequence is about working

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:08.990 align:middle line:90%
with karma that's in us.

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:13.500 align:middle line:84%
It's about working with
the yin-yang forces,

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:17.387 align:middle line:84%
specifically inside our heart,
inside our mind and our heart.

00:36:17.387 --> 00:36:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's about working
in our relationships.

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's more that we
could get into versus the Key

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.275 align:middle line:84%
with the lines, but we don't
have time for the lines.

00:36:26.275 --> 00:36:28.650 align:middle line:84%
When you get into the book,
you can read about the lines.

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only one
that I have actually

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:36.760 align:middle line:84%
been through the entire
audio course on that.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.190 align:middle line:90%
And it is very--

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:41.490 align:middle line:84%
what's wonderful
about it is it takes--

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:43.590 align:middle line:84%
you have personal
responsibility,

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:44.980 align:middle line:90%
but you're human.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.020 align:middle line:90%
We're all human.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:50.400 align:middle line:84%
It takes any hiding
from yourself, secrecy,

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.380 align:middle line:90%
away from the need to hide away.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Because here it is out in
the open, here's this wound,

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:57.270 align:middle line:84%
and you share it with
many other people.

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
that's really key is

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.035 align:middle line:84%
to take this feeling of guilt
away from people that they've

00:37:02.035 --> 00:37:02.910 align:middle line:90%
done something wrong.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:03.783 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Exactly.

00:37:03.783 --> 00:37:04.700 align:middle line:90%
It brings us together.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:05.715 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It brings us together.

00:37:05.715 --> 00:37:06.375 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, it really does.

00:37:06.375 --> 00:37:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now we
have the Pearl sequence.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Yeah, the
Pearl sequence is fun,

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:12.840 align:middle line:90%
because it's about prosperity.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And I set it up initially
so that these would

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:18.390 align:middle line:90%
unravel as a story and flow.

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:20.340 align:middle line:84%
So you do part one,
part two, part three.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.650 align:middle line:84%
But then at a certain
point, my team and I

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:25.270 align:middle line:84%
just said, let's
just make it open

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:26.730 align:middle line:90%
so anyone can start anywhere.

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:28.180 align:middle line:90%
And it works like that.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.605 align:middle line:84%
And so lots of women start
with the Venus work, because--

00:37:30.605 --> 00:37:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah,
because we're women.

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: --it's the emotional--
it's the emotional work, right?

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:35.430 align:middle line:90%
And men don't want to do that.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Generally, the men want
to get to the money one.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's get
to the prosperity one.

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:38.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: And the irony
is that, actually, you

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:43.860 align:middle line:84%
need to do the emotional work
in order for the prosperity.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.230 align:middle line:90%
But you can start there.

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.820 align:middle line:90%
It's just reverse engineering.

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And so in the Pearl
sequence, which

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:54.840 align:middle line:84%
is a very beautiful series of
transmissions and teachings,

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.990 align:middle line:84%
you can look at your
Keys, and they show you

00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:59.430 align:middle line:90%
how you're designed to prosper.

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:02.760 align:middle line:84%
But the shadow
patterns show you how

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.410 align:middle line:90%
you get in the way of yourself.

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And you also have
to re-understand

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:07.720 align:middle line:90%
what is prosperity.

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.715 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: It's not just
about having money.

00:38:09.715 --> 00:38:10.375 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not being
on the cover of a magazine.

00:38:10.375 --> 00:38:11.665 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: It's not about
being successful.

00:38:11.665 --> 00:38:12.465 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:38:12.465 --> 00:38:15.475 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: It's actually a
much deeper total thing

00:38:15.475 --> 00:38:16.600 align:middle line:90%
in your whole of your life.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Prosperity involves
your relationships.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.530 align:middle line:84%
It involves your
family, community.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:22.330 align:middle line:90%
It involves everything.

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:25.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's a whole
new attitude shift.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.040 align:middle line:90%
So the Pearl opens us up.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.560 align:middle line:90%
It's very magical teaching.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.450 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people use it
in there to help them

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:35.770 align:middle line:84%
with their businesses, to help
them with shifting the energy

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:38.500 align:middle line:84%
and the frequency of
how they see money.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've done lots of
talks and things on that.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:42.385 align:middle line:90%
But it's really revolutionary.

00:38:42.385 --> 00:38:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.872 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I just wanted
to lay it out,

00:38:45.872 --> 00:38:48.080 align:middle line:84%
because people are looking
at their charts right now,

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.490 align:middle line:84%
so they know what the intention
of each of those sequences is.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And I want to mention also
that you and your team

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.240 align:middle line:84%
are working on a relationship
app for the Venus sequence,

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.530 align:middle line:90%
which is really exciting.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:04.000 align:middle line:84%
That's where I was saying,
that has pop appeal.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Because it's going
to be fun for people

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:08.680 align:middle line:84%
to look at, really
tongue-in-cheek, like, oops,

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.305 align:middle line:84%
you might want to
think about this one.

00:39:10.305 --> 00:39:12.138 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Yeah, we were
sharing some of those.

00:39:12.138 --> 00:39:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, it is profound.

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.040 align:middle line:90%
It's relationship chemistry.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.800 align:middle line:84%
So you can use these
Keys and these Gene Keys

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.080 align:middle line:90%
to read relationship chemistry.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, my team and
I are writing that one

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:30.760 align:middle line:90%
and creating it.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.650 align:middle line:90%
A lot of insights have come.

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to show it
as a bit tongue-in-cheek,

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:37.990 align:middle line:90%
but also, it's profound.

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:40.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's showing a
specific chemistry.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:42.910 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
any relationship,

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:46.480 align:middle line:84%
there's a third component,
which is the chemistry itself.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And the chemistry has
its own intelligence.

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:50.620 align:middle line:90%
It's neither you or that one.

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:54.970 align:middle line:84%
It's created in the interference
field of the two of you.

00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And how you surrender,
and understand,

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.320 align:middle line:84%
and work with that chemistry,
and finally, bring harmony out

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.690 align:middle line:84%
of it, is a lifelong
process in any relationship.

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's fun, because
you'll be able to look.

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.000 align:middle line:90%
And we've given them all names.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.750 align:middle line:90%
And they're funny names as well.

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:14.530 align:middle line:84%
We've given them like shadow
names, which are horrible.

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And we've given them
really beautiful, ecstatic,

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:17.880 align:middle line:90%
wild names.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:18.825 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:40:18.825 --> 00:40:20.200 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait till
that comes out.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.612 align:middle line:84%
I've already told people
that you-- my few friends.

00:40:22.612 --> 00:40:23.570 align:middle line:90%
They're going to do it.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:24.737 align:middle line:90%
They can't wait for the app.

00:40:24.737 --> 00:40:26.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting,
because when

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.360 align:middle line:84%
we were talking a
couple of weeks ago,

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.410 align:middle line:84%
you said out of this, there are
like 21 major connection points

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:34.270 align:middle line:84%
that people have
that show you can

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:37.060 align:middle line:84%
have a soul connection, an
intellectual connection,

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.640 align:middle line:90%
emotional, physical, and so on.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.670 align:middle line:84%
But that out of all of those--
the Holy Grail that people

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:45.100 align:middle line:84%
in the Western world
look for is romance--

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:47.140 align:middle line:90%
only three of the potential--

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.055 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: 21.

00:40:48.055 --> 00:40:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --21 connections are
actually romantic by nature.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And even if you find one,
they're really hard to manage,

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:57.580 align:middle line:90%
because it requires distance.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.550 align:middle line:84%
It requires that you
maintain the longing.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:04.240 align:middle line:84%
So you can fall in love with
someone, but the more familiar

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.220 align:middle line:84%
you become, if you don't
maintain that longing,

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.020 align:middle line:84%
you lose the beauty
of the relationship.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love
the nuances there.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: And there are different
types of longing as well.

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:16.450 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, you're
right, the thing

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:19.077 align:middle line:84%
we're looking for is
actually-- it's quite rare.

00:41:19.077 --> 00:41:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is quite rare,
and it requires distance,

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.230 align:middle line:90%
so there you go.

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So one other thing, because we
have just a couple of minutes

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.730 align:middle line:84%
left, I wanted to
say is, I was doing

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Gene Keys maybe a year
or so ago with a couple

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:32.290 align:middle line:90%
of my female friends.

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
so interesting is

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:37.360 align:middle line:84%
that as we were going
through our primary Keys,

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.610 align:middle line:90%
it was so easy for women--

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:41.140 align:middle line:90%
and I found this sense--

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:42.940 align:middle line:84%
women to see their
Shadow, oh, yeah,

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:47.100 align:middle line:84%
I do that, I do that, but harder
for women to see the Gift.

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, this goes with
societal conditioning,

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.410 align:middle line:84%
historical conditioning,
ancestral conditioning.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And even if you look
at serotonin levels,

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:57.540 align:middle line:84%
white men have the
highest serotonin levels.

00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Everybody else has lower levels.

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And so it's
interesting, because we

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.880 align:middle line:84%
were able to say,
wait a minute, you

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.500 align:middle line:84%
can't see this
beauty in yourself?

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And so doing it
together was fun,

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:11.850 align:middle line:84%
because we were validating each
other's gifts that we may not

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:13.620 align:middle line:90%
have been seeing.

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the
beauty in the group work.

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's what I see a lot in
the Gene Keys global community

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:24.480 align:middle line:84%
is the women get there
quicker, generally,

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.060 align:middle line:84%
because they're willing
to look at the Shadows.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:30.000 align:middle line:84%
The men are a little bit
more tentative about that.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.613 align:middle line:84%
Not all of them, of course,
but, generally, it's

00:42:34.613 --> 00:42:36.405 align:middle line:84%
hard-- that's why the
men go for the Pearl.

00:42:36.405 --> 00:42:37.425 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where
are my power Keys?

00:42:37.425 --> 00:42:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, exactly.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.160 align:middle line:90%
So you've got to bring the men--

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.210 align:middle line:90%
and I'm, obviously, one of them.

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So one of my missions
is to bring the men down

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:48.610 align:middle line:84%
into the emotional realm
so that they actually do

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:49.990 align:middle line:90%
start to unlock those patterns.

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Because then they become just
a much more holistic, happier

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.440 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have to hide
in addictive work tendencies,

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:04.172 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is
that they hide in.

00:43:04.172 --> 00:43:06.547 align:middle line:84%
They actually integrate--
become integrated in the world.

00:43:06.547 --> 00:43:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is an
important mission, by the way.

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:08.525 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, huge.

00:43:08.525 --> 00:43:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very important,
so that females and males

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.120 align:middle line:90%
can integrate emotionally.

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:12.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's important.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Yeah, because the
women have been saying forever,

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:15.600 align:middle line:90%
where are the men?

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where are the men?

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Where are the really--

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.190 align:middle line:84%
not this fluffy, New Age men,
the really deep, gutsy men

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:22.440 align:middle line:90%
who've done their bloody work.

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:23.914 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Where are they?

00:43:23.914 --> 00:43:24.362 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:43:24.362 --> 00:43:25.162 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:43:25.162 --> 00:43:28.545 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: So my mission is to
help more men get to that.

00:43:28.545 --> 00:43:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good for you.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.520 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we're out of time here.

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.480 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say, the last
time I had you on camera

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.797 align:middle line:90%
here was so many years ago.

00:43:38.797 --> 00:43:39.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a new audience.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:40.860 align:middle line:10%
It was-- we were trying
to figure it out--

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:42.780 align:middle line:10%
six or seven years
ago, in London,

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.423 align:middle line:10%
and you had this shock of
long red hair at the time.

00:43:45.423 --> 00:43:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, my Jesus face.

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:47.775 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, your Jesus face.

00:43:47.775 --> 00:43:48.575 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:48.575 --> 00:43:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, aligning
with your potency.

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:56.380 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, we went through some
of those things at that time.

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:58.450 align:middle line:84%
But your work has
evolved, you've evolved,

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Gaia has evolved,
we've evolved, so,

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and you have a
new audience here,

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:02.860 align:middle line:84%
so I'm really happy to
introduce people to you.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:03.685 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Well, thank you.

00:44:03.685 --> 00:44:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So any final
thoughts before we sign off?

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:09.340 align:middle line:10%
>>RUDD: I think I'd just say to
people who are watching this,

just the thing I said about
pausing, whether you use

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:15.430 align:middle line:10%
the little app or not, just
if you can harvest a few more

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:21.160 align:middle line:10%
pauses in your everyday life
and just see what magic jumps

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.760 align:middle line:10%
into them, I think you're
going to find your life

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:25.930 align:middle line:10%
starts to take a new course.

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I absolutely
believe you.

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:27.962 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: It's that simple.

00:44:27.962 --> 00:44:31.145 align:middle line:84%
That's why I got it in under
100 pages, it's that simple.

00:44:31.145 --> 00:44:31.945 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Love it.

00:44:31.945 --> 00:44:32.745 align:middle line:90%

just some months in the future.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the main
work is the Gene Keys.

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yes.

00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So Richard,
thank you so much.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:46.615 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Thank you.

00:44:46.615 --> 00:44:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know we're
going to continue

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:49.600 align:middle line:84%

future here on Gaia,
