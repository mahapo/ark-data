00:00:21.434 --> 00:00:23.600 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: While
many people have not heard

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.660 align:middle line:10%
of the 2012 phenomena
until relatively recently,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.130 align:middle line:10%
this information has been
circulating since the late

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.700 align:middle line:10%
1970s and early '80s
in esoteric circles.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.510 align:middle line:10%
It was a time when psychic
phenomena was being studied

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.710 align:middle line:10%
at universities, channeling
came into our awareness,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.390 align:middle line:10%
and the average person began
asking the bigger questions.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Jay Weidner has been on this
path throughout those decades

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and has written extensively
on the subject of the larger

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.380 align:middle line:84%
cycles of consciousness
as seen through the lens

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.560 align:middle line:90%
of the ancients.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Today we speak about
2012, its cosmic roots,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and what it promises
as to our future.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.870 align:middle line:90%
This is so much fun.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.340 align:middle line:90%
This'll be a lively hour.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.080 align:middle line:84%
What I want to do today--
and this is a tall task--

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:84%
is you're speaking on
behalf of the ancients, all

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:84%
of the contemporary
authors on this subject,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and giving us an overview as to
all the different reflections

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.390 align:middle line:90%
and visions of 2012.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:10%
But before we do that, for
anyone who doesn't already

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.340 align:middle line:10%
know you, give us
a little background

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.060 align:middle line:10%
as to how you became so
ensconced in this subject.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:10%
>> JAY WEIDNER: Well,
that's a good question.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:10%
Years ago, I was
living in Los Angeles,

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.910 align:middle line:10%
and I attended a garage sale.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.410 align:middle line:10%
I was a book freak,
buying books.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.146 align:middle line:84%
And I found an
esoteric book sale.

00:01:35.146 --> 00:01:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Some old guy had
died, and he was

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.320 align:middle line:84%
selling his books-- his
wife was-- for a $1 each.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.007 align:middle line:84%
And I bought 20 or 30 books and
went home, and one of the books

00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:84%
was called "Mystery
of the Cathedrals"

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.220 align:middle line:84%
by an enigmatic anonymous
man named Fulcanelli.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And the book proposed that
the ancient Gothic cathedrals

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.030 align:middle line:84%
were not built by the Catholic
Church or by popes or anything.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.830 align:middle line:84%
It was built by
Templars and alchemists

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and that they were
homages to alchemy

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and that the secret
of alchemy was

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:84%
in the architecture of the
agent Gothic cathedrals.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.950 align:middle line:84%
I was a skeptic, a journalist,
believed in science and said,

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.380 align:middle line:84%
this is just crap, so I began
to try to debunk the book.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And 20 years later,
the book debunked me,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.250 align:middle line:90%
and I became what I am now.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And in that book at the very
end, there's a last chapter,

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.600 align:middle line:84%
and it's called "The
Cyclic Cross of Hendaye,"

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.140 align:middle line:84%
and it talks about an ancient
cross, a 400-year-old cross,

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.300 align:middle line:84%
which Fulcanelli
deciphers, and assures us

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.410 align:middle line:84%
that it's talking about a
time in the near future.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:84%
"Mystery of the Cathedrals"
came out in 1926.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So the near future
there would come

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.720 align:middle line:84%
a time of great
transformation of humanity,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and that if you decipher
the Cross of Hendaye the way

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.600 align:middle line:84%
the Fulcanelli does, you'll be
able to tell the date and what

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.850 align:middle line:90%
So naturally, I got intrigued.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.420 align:middle line:84%
I flew to France and made sure
the cross was really there,

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.870 align:middle line:90%
and I started looking into it.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.160 align:middle line:90%
And it was like a zip file.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I opened it up, and literally
10,000 tons of information

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:84%
came through that I was not
even familiar with about Egypt,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.450 align:middle line:84%
about alchemy, about
the Sufis, about all

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.850 align:middle line:90%
these different things.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I was
a pretty smart guy,

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.484 align:middle line:84%
and when I found
out all this stuff,

00:03:27.484 --> 00:03:29.650 align:middle line:84%
I realized how little I
really knew about the world,

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.030 align:middle line:84%
how maladjusted my
education had been.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.780 align:middle line:84%
So I began looking into
all aspects of esoteric art

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and science in
order to understand

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.406 align:middle line:84%
the Cross of Hendaye,
and in 1989, '90,

00:03:47.406 --> 00:03:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I deciphered it
almost all the way.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.710 align:middle line:84%
I realized that it was pointing
to the equinoxes of 2002

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:84%
and saying that it was in the
mid-range of a 20-year cycle

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.830 align:middle line:84%
that began in 1992
and ends in 2012.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere in
that time period

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.950 align:middle line:84%
begins and ends
this transformation.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Now at the time I knew nothing
about the Mayan calendar

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.190 align:middle line:90%
or any of this other stuff.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.975 align:middle line:84%
So I went back and
started looking,

00:04:17.975 --> 00:04:22.445 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that the Mayan
calendar was put out in baktuns

00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:26.860 align:middle line:84%
or 20-year cycles, 19.8-year
cycles, something like that,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.210 align:middle line:84%
and that the last baktun
indeed started in 1992 and ends

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.897 align:middle line:90%
in 2012.

00:04:34.897 --> 00:04:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: First of all, I
want to backtrack just a sec.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Why were you intrigued
with Fulcanelli?

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.750 align:middle line:84%
What kind of
knowledge did this man

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.150 align:middle line:84%
possess that really set
you on such a firm path?

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: The thing
that got me about "Mystery

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:84%
of Cathedrals" was the
intelligence of the writer.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was so
overwhelming intelligent,

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:84%
sort of like Stephen
Hawking on steroids,

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.970 align:middle line:84%
and that I knew that
if it was a hoax it

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.510 align:middle line:84%
had to be the most intelligent
hoax I've ever come against.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.032 align:middle line:84%
Two, the guy knew
things about history,

00:05:10.032 --> 00:05:11.615 align:middle line:84%
especially about the
French Revolution

00:05:11.615 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and around that
time period, that

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.700 align:middle line:90%
actually was impossible to know.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.100 align:middle line:84%
He knew where graffiti
was that had been removed

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.600 align:middle line:84%
in the early 1800s that was in
Notre Dame Cathedral talking

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
about Napoleon and
the rise of Napoleon.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.600 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well,
how can this be?

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And then he intimates
throughout the book

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.077 align:middle line:84%
that he's several
hundred years old, right?

00:05:34.077 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.100 align:middle line:90%
So he is an alchemist.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: He is an
alchemist, and he was an adept,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that he was part
of a group of people who live

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.490 align:middle line:84%
in the south of France who are
preserving the knowledge to be

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.427 align:middle line:84%
released very slowly,
especially at this time.

00:05:50.427 --> 00:05:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tell us
about those people.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I was going to ask you
if he belonged to some sect

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that we may know about
that might even be cloaked

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.250 align:middle line:84%
as one of the secret
societies or beyond that even,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.490 align:middle line:90%
more esoteric perhaps.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.198 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:06:02.198 --> 00:06:05.870 align:middle line:84%
What happened was was that there
was an esoteric Freemasonry

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.730 align:middle line:84%
that was centered
in France, and it

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:84%
was usurped in around 1750,
1770, around that time period.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.470 align:middle line:84%
We don't really
know what happened.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.280 align:middle line:84%
But this group in
France was usurped

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.320 align:middle line:84%
by a British Freemasonry-- a
Scottish-British Freemasonry--

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.350 align:middle line:84%
and the group in France
decided that's it.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.250 align:middle line:84%
We want nothing to
do with you guys,

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.380 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to give you
our secrets, you're profane,

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:84%
we're sacred, and they
disappeared and went

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:84%
underground, and we've
never seen them again.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.970 align:middle line:84%
However, they're pulling the
strings of history, silently,

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.504 align:middle line:90%
psychically.

00:06:41.504 --> 00:06:43.920 align:middle line:84%
What Fulcanelli says is they
come into your head at night.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.495 align:middle line:84%
They pick you out, and
they come into your head,

00:06:45.495 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:90%
and they give you information.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:47.830 align:middle line:90%
They drop books in your lap.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.250 align:middle line:84%
They do anything they can,
because that other Freemasonry

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.522 align:middle line:90%
became the Illuminati.

00:06:52.522 --> 00:06:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: And so this French
Freemasonry is at war with

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.160 align:middle line:84%
them-- if war is not really a
struggle-- with them for us.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And the Illuminati wants to
control us and keep us asleep.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.420 align:middle line:84%
So they're the owls, and
this group is the roosters

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.850 align:middle line:90%
because they want to wake us up.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.527 align:middle line:84%
So it's the roosters
and the owls,

00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:09.860 align:middle line:90%
and they're fighting each other.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Fulcanelli is a
member of this group.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting about this is
the original Harry Potter story

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.004 align:middle line:84%
is actually a story
about Fulcanelli.

00:07:19.004 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I did not read the
Harry Potter stories.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.180 align:middle line:84%
I saw the first movie,
and I went to see it,

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.300 align:middle line:84%
and I just literally my
jaw dropped to the ground.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Because Fulcanelli's
student, Eugene Canseliet,

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.660 align:middle line:84%
received a letter in 1952,
long after Fulcanelli

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.210 align:middle line:84%
had left this world, saying
come to the train station

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:38.270 align:middle line:90%
in Seville.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.110 align:middle line:84%
It was written in an
aristocratic handwriting,

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:90%
this letter, with a seal on it.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And so he went to
the train station

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.610 align:middle line:84%
in Seville, just like
Harry Potter receives

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.410 align:middle line:84%
a letter in
aristocratic handwriting

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:84%
with a seal to go
to a train station.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Only when Eugene Canseliet
went to the train station,

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.210 align:middle line:84%
he was picked up by a
limousine, blindfolded,

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.630 align:middle line:84%
and taken into the Pyrenees
Mountains to a castle,

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.380 align:middle line:84%
just like Harry Potter, where
they were taught esoteric arts

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.490 align:middle line:84%
with children all dressed
in medieval clothing,

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.950 align:middle line:90%
just like Harry Potter.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:10.720 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And Eugene Canseliet stayed in
this place for a couple weeks,

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.090 align:middle line:84%
saw Fulcanelli,
who is now 40 years

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.010 align:middle line:84%
younger than he was
when he last saw him,

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:84%
which was the time period
that had elapsed, or 35 years.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And Eugene Canseliet must
have failed whatever test,

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.380 align:middle line:84%
because he was taken
back to the car,

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:84%
blindfolded, and taken
back to the train station.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.071 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:32.279 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: You failed, dude.

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:32.668 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You failed.

00:08:32.668 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:33.642 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:08:33.642 --> 00:08:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting
here is also

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:84%
the Basque language has
not yet been deciphered.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could say most
likely because of its proximity

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.980 align:middle line:84%
to what was Atlantis, is an
ancient Atlantian language,

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.140 align:middle line:90%
at least in its roots.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: That's what
they will tell you,

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.710 align:middle line:90%
the Basque people.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle line:90%
I've talked to them.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:49.990 align:middle line:90%
They will tell you.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They
will tell you that.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:50.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.881 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: They came from
a catastrophe somewhere west

00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:54.880 align:middle line:90%
of France, and they moved there.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And the Cross of
Hendaye is actually

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.829 align:middle line:84%
the third or fourth version
of the Cross of Hendaye,

00:08:59.829 --> 00:09:01.370 align:middle line:84%
because they
deteriorate after a time

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.661 align:middle line:84%
and then they build a new
one, because this information

00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:07.030 align:middle line:84%
was so important to be passed
down through these things.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.495 align:middle line:84%
And so when the alchemical
revolution started in Spain

00:09:09.495 --> 00:09:12.690 align:middle line:84%
when Islam and the
Moroccans invaded Spain,

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.380 align:middle line:84%
they brought all the Arab
alchemical arts to Spain.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And Europe was-- you
couldn't read and write.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.680 align:middle line:90%
It was illegal.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.980 align:middle line:84%
The Church had outlawed all
of the reading and writing.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.010 align:middle line:84%
So all the
intellectuals of Europe

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.665 align:middle line:84%
came through the
town of Hendaye--

00:09:26.665 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:84%
it was the only way
around the Pyrenees

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.980 align:middle line:84%
to get to Spain-- to
learn the alchemical art.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So Hendaye not only is a place
right on the border with Spain

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:40.450 align:middle line:84%
that was a passageway back and
forth between all these adepts

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:44.880 align:middle line:84%
going back and forth, but
its name itself, Hendaye,

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.170 align:middle line:84%
is like the egg day
or the beginning day

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:53.260 align:middle line:84%
or the day that the
rooster crows, the hen-day.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And so even it's a sign of
waking up, the name itself is.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Also, you don't pronounce the
H in French, so it's en-day.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: En-day.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.110 align:middle line:90%
End day.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:02.943 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: End day.

00:10:02.943 --> 00:10:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: It's all
a playing on words.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to remember
that English was inculcated

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.820 align:middle line:84%
by these same
alchemists, John Dee,

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Francis Bacon working
with Queen Elizabeth

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.060 align:middle line:84%
inculcated, through
Shakespeare, English

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.936 align:middle line:84%
to be the magical
language of the future.

00:10:20.936 --> 00:10:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Now we could go
down a lot of roads

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.951 align:middle line:84%
because we could get into
the inception of the--

00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:27.325 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: It
all leads to 2012.

00:10:27.325 --> 00:10:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It does.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.550 align:middle line:84%
You go back from the Freemasons
to the Knight Templars.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.940 align:middle line:84%
You start looking at very
special properties on some

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:90%
of those peaks in the Pyrenees.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And we have some other intrigues
going on, but, as you say,

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.970 align:middle line:84%
all roads lead back to
this period of time.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk for a
moment about 1970s,

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.590 align:middle line:84%
when you were first getting
going, all these books.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a book that
you particularly

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.084 align:middle line:84%
treasure by a man named
Frank Waters, right?

00:10:50.084 --> 00:10:50.791 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that was
the first glimpse you saw

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.299 align:middle line:90%
of reference in modern times.

00:10:55.299 --> 00:10:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: What Frank Waters
did was he was one of the first

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.940 align:middle line:84%
guys to go down to Mexico, and
he learned the Mayan language

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.120 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And he was an amateur
anthropologist,

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and he came up against
J. Eric Thompson's work

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.300 align:middle line:90%
on the Mayan calendar.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
with Mexico mystique

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:24.680 align:middle line:84%
was that Waters was counting--
not counting the year 0.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:90%
So you have BC to AD, OK?

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And what he was doing was
he was counting-- no, he

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:37.004 align:middle line:84%
was counting the year 0 as
if it was a full year and not

00:11:37.004 --> 00:11:38.920 align:middle line:84%
the end of one and the
beginning of the other.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And he dropped it off
at December 21, 2011

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.650 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't
do the count right.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.290 align:middle line:90%
You have to do a day count.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.500 align:middle line:84%
The Mayan calendar
is in a day count.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So later scholars after Waters
did the actual day count,

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:84%
forgetting the
Christian calendar,

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.190 align:middle line:90%
which wasn't right anyway.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The
Gregorian calendar?

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: Gregorian calendar,
which isn't right anyway.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.320 align:middle line:84%
It's got all sorts of
days missing in it.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.655 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh,
interesting things there.

00:12:03.655 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So they just did the day
count, forgot the Christian,

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.810 align:middle line:84%
forgot the Western,
just did a day count,

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.280 align:middle line:84%
and you ended at
December 21, 2012, OK?

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a solstice.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.370 align:middle line:84%
That's an important sacred
date in all ancient cultures.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:21.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is where it
stayed for about 10 years

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:28.050 align:middle line:84%
or so, and then in the
late '80s, early '90s, '94,

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:32.610 align:middle line:84%
'95 around that time, they began
inventing the Voyager astronomy

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:33.930 align:middle line:90%
software.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And an enterprising
man, who later

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.860 align:middle line:84%
became a friend of mine,
John Major Jenkins, who'd

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.460 align:middle line:84%
written a couple books
on the Mayans, "Tzolkin"

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and a couple other books,
got the Voyager software,

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:46.410 align:middle line:84%
and he decided
that he would look

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.900 align:middle line:84%
to see what the stars
were like on December 21.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now is this a
really pivotal event that this

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.160 align:middle line:90%
software existed?

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: It is.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: Because you could
do it with armillary spheres,

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.180 align:middle line:84%
like Nostradamus did,
but it doesn't tell you--

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.190 align:middle line:90%
it's not as exact as software.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So he typed in
December 21, 2012,

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.400 align:middle line:84%
and he went, and
he looked to see.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And then he saw that
the center of the galaxy

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:14.600 align:middle line:84%
was crossing the rising sun on
that morning at 11:11 Universal

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.870 align:middle line:90%
Standard Time.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And he went, oh my god,
what does this mean?

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.430 align:middle line:84%
How could the
Mayans-- did they know

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.849 align:middle line:84%
that the center of the galaxy
and the sun and the Earth

00:13:23.849 --> 00:13:25.390 align:middle line:84%
were all going to
be all in one line?

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:26.181 align:middle line:90%
Did they know that?

00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:27.520 align:middle line:90%
How could they know that?

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And so then he began
back-engineering this,

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.700 align:middle line:84%
and he realized that, in
fact, on a mountaintop,

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.184 align:middle line:84%
like Guatemala, southern
Mexico, on a clear night,

00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:41.100 align:middle line:84%
you can actually see the
center of the galaxy.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.980 align:middle line:90%
It's like a big cloud of stars.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And he realized that
someone with a good eyesight

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.710 align:middle line:84%
could actually extrapolate
with triangulation

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.090 align:middle line:84%
and come and realize when
that center of the galaxy

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.600 align:middle line:84%
was going to rise
up, at what time,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and hit the sun
when it was rising

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.630 align:middle line:90%
so they'd rise at the same time.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:07.995 align:middle line:84%
And they built the calendar
around that event, OK?

00:14:07.995 --> 00:14:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing that's important
is that they're seers.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:17.020 align:middle line:84%
The Mayan seers
were time travelers.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.370 align:middle line:84%
They used magic mushrooms, and
they traveled into the future.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.740 align:middle line:84%
We know this from their myths
and from the "Popol Vuh."

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And so what we believe is
that, just like Nostradamus

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:34.040 align:middle line:84%
and all seers, they all went
to the future, these diviners,

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and they saw
something happening.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And they said, whoa,
this is so important we

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.570 align:middle line:84%
have to build a
calendar around it.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
Jenkins' conclusion was.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.020 align:middle line:84%
It's not the alignment itself
that's causing the event,

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.234 align:middle line:84%
just like noon on
the clock doesn't

00:14:49.234 --> 00:14:50.775 align:middle line:84%
mean you have to--
time to eat lunch.

00:14:50.775 --> 00:14:52.425 align:middle line:84%
You eat lunch when
you're hungry.

00:14:52.425 --> 00:14:54.050 align:middle line:84%
It just happens that
you're hungry when

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.650 align:middle line:84%
the two things are
pointing up, OK?

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:84%
So when this alignment
happens, it's

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.780 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily
causing the event.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just that's the time on the
clock, the great cosmic clock

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.430 align:middle line:90%
we're watching.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.426 align:middle line:84%
And so they said we've
got to make a calendar

00:15:07.426 --> 00:15:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and tell our people
in the future

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:84%
that this dramatic event
is coming down line.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So I met John
Jenkins right when he

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.987 align:middle line:90%
was finishing his book in '98.

00:15:16.987 --> 00:15:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Is it "Cosmogenesis"?

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.111 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah, "Maya
Cosmogenesis 2012."

00:15:20.111 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And I had just finished
my book, "The Mysteries

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.020 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Cross of Hendaye."

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And so we were living
in the same city,

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:90%
and we began talking.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.099 align:middle line:84%
And he was blown
away by my research,

00:15:30.099 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:84%
and I was blown away
by his research.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I decided that one
of the leads that I had gotten

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.580 align:middle line:84%
from the Great
Cross of Hendaye was

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.660 align:middle line:84%
that there was a cross in Peru,
where the same symbols were

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:90%
on that cross.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Peru
to find that cross,

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:49.130 align:middle line:84%
and I found a cross that
had been broken and defaced.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.560 align:middle line:90%
So I did not find the cross.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.930 align:middle line:84%
But what I did find was the
Incan people and the Q'ero

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.450 align:middle line:84%
people, and so I
began talking to them.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that they
have a prophecy about 2012.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Now this is '98 now, '98.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.200 align:middle line:84%
So I spent many hours talking
to them in their hut, these two

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.990 align:middle line:84%
shamans, and they call
it the Pachacuti, which

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:14.130 align:middle line:84%
means the tearing of
the veil between worlds

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.810 align:middle line:84%
that would begin
happening in 2012.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And they said that it would
start in the United States,

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:22.770 align:middle line:84%
that for some
reason this was all

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:24.820 align:middle line:84%
going to be based in
the United States,

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.620 align:middle line:84%
and that the United
States was going

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:31.770 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to change
from a people of the brain

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:34.120 align:middle line:84%
to a people of the
heart, and that

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.400 align:middle line:84%
would lead the world to
this next thing that's

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.770 align:middle line:90%
going to happen.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:46.450 align:middle line:84%
It will start in 1992 and
will go on to 2030 or 2035

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:50.480 align:middle line:84%
before this is over, an
incredibly tumultuous time,

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.120 align:middle line:84%
which will appear to most
of the people living in it

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.750 align:middle line:90%
like it's the end of the world.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.319 align:middle line:84%
But to the
enlightened ones, they

00:16:57.319 --> 00:16:59.360 align:middle line:84%
will see that, no, it's
not the end of the world.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.224 align:middle line:90%
It's the beginning of the world.

00:17:01.224 --> 00:17:02.890 align:middle line:84%
It just looks like
the end of the world.

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what you're
saying is really key,

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
this whole notion that we move
from the head to the heart.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Right.

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.289 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we can
already see this happening

00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:10.270 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: We can.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.156 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No
matter where you go,

00:17:12.156 --> 00:17:16.940 align:middle line:84%
people are starting to say of
all ages that this is painful.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.839 align:middle line:84%
Life has become dry and
heartless and painful.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:21.880 align:middle line:90%
You hear that everywhere.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.569 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yep.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so the tearing
down of these structures is

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.050 align:middle line:84%
really what they
were talking about.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.290 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go through
each of these beings, each

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.050 align:middle line:84%
of these different, well,
people and also societies

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and talk about their
specific vision

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.280 align:middle line:84%
as to what had to
be torn asunder

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.160 align:middle line:90%
and what has to take its place.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.820 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
the Mayan and how

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.810 align:middle line:84%
they visioned what this
period would look like

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.230 align:middle line:84%
and what would have
to be given way to.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:50.500 align:middle line:84%
The thing that's important to
understand about all of this

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:56.680 align:middle line:84%
is that human beings, I hate to
say it, are basically lazy, OK?

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And they won't really get off
the couch unless they have to.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We
learn through pain.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: We do.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Sadly, we
learn through pain.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Exactly.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's through catastrophe-- a
divorce, death of a loved one--

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:12.610 align:middle line:84%
that you shed old
possibilities and begin

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:14.150 align:middle line:90%
to look at new possibilities.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the painful
thing that caused it.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, getting fired
from a job can be terrible,

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.410 align:middle line:84%
but actually it can also
be a liberating experience.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened is
is that this thing that's

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:30.220 align:middle line:84%
happening in 2012 had to
be preceded by catastrophe.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.565 align:middle line:84%
So I was waiting for a
catastrophe to happen.

00:18:32.565 --> 00:18:33.271 align:middle line:90%
Honestly, I was.

00:18:33.271 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You could say
it's a train wreck right now.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: It is.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:90%
We're in the train wreck.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're
in the train wreck.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I predicted
that there was

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.910 align:middle line:84%
going to be a catastrophe
on The History Channel

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and on all these TV shows and
everything, and it happened.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.682 align:middle line:84%
And everybody thought I was
some kind of prognosticator.

00:18:48.682 --> 00:18:50.140 align:middle line:84%
All you had do is
look at the world

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.056 align:middle line:84%
to know that this thing
was not going to last.

00:18:52.056 --> 00:18:53.290 align:middle line:90%
It was not sustainable.

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:53.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So now we're in the catastrophe,
starting in 2008-- really

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.751 align:middle line:90%
starting in 2001.

00:18:57.751 --> 00:18:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Now 2008, we're really
in the thick of it.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.166 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this
is important to say,

00:19:01.166 --> 00:19:04.780 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people were
waiting for the big polarity

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.760 align:middle line:84%
shift where
everything goes dark.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people on the planet
end up deceased and the like.

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.300 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
that dramatic at all.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.480 align:middle line:84%
The reality is our
survival is oriented

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.110 align:middle line:84%
toward the systems that
exist, toward money, security.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Those things have
been torn asunder.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: They're
all going away.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:25.756 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And is this more what
you were referring to was these

00:19:25.756 --> 00:19:29.661 align:middle line:84%
systems, not necessarily
the natural cataclysms?

00:19:29.661 --> 00:19:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: Actually, I think
there could be a natural

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:32.210 align:middle line:90%
cataclysm.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to deny
that that could happen.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, we have
a lot of activity, yeah.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: But we are natural.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: And so we're
having a cataclysm,

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:39.430 align:middle line:90%
so it's a natural cataclysm.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:40.055 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: And so
we let it happen.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Just like some people
let a divorce happen,

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.642 align:middle line:84%
they know their marriage
is falling apart,

00:19:47.642 --> 00:19:49.100 align:middle line:84%
but they don't do
anything about it

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.364 align:middle line:84%
because they kind of secretly
want it to end disastrously,

00:19:52.364 --> 00:19:54.030 align:middle line:84%
because then that way
they're liberated.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.340 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're in right now.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.720 align:middle line:84%
We are falling into a
disaster of our own making,

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.543 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to force
us to find our way out

00:20:03.543 --> 00:20:06.402 align:middle line:84%
of it by being in
the disaster itself.

00:20:06.402 --> 00:20:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:09.401 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, you mentioned
something a moment ago,

00:20:09.401 --> 00:20:12.340 align:middle line:84%
because we allowed it to
happen, because we chose it,

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.890 align:middle line:84%
there was talk at that
time-- I know even

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:18.450 align:middle line:84%
in the esoteric circles I was
in 30 years ago, 20 years ago--

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.940 align:middle line:90%
that we could change.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.900 align:middle line:84%
We had the power to
cha-- and I didn't really

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.030 align:middle line:84%
fully grock it
until more recently.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:84%
We had the power to change
some of these outcomes,

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:31.900 align:middle line:84%
even in terms of physical
cataclysms on the planet,

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.849 align:middle line:84%
had we been able to ratchet it
up in our own consciousness.

00:20:34.849 --> 00:20:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: That's right.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it was even said
in a couple of places that,

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.920 align:middle line:84%
had we been able
to rise to that,

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.805 align:middle line:84%
there are certain events
that would have been avoided

00:20:43.805 --> 00:20:44.305 align:middle line:90%
physically.

00:20:44.305 --> 00:20:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: That's right.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.178 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Whether
they're tsunami,

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:49.620 align:middle line:84%
whether they're earthquakes that
have yet to be, we don't know.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: We don't.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There may be
some that have been averted.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.820 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:53.903 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: We don't know.

00:20:53.903 --> 00:20:54.814 align:middle line:90%
I think there have.

00:20:54.814 --> 00:20:56.480 align:middle line:84%
I think the fact that
we went through 40

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.770 align:middle line:84%
years of a nuclear stare
down with the Soviet Union

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.150 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't have anything
go off or anything happen,

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:04.320 align:middle line:90%
I think we changed the timeline.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.170 align:middle line:90%
And we can change the timeline.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:84%
It's possible to
change the future,

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.560 align:middle line:84%
if you so desire to
change the future.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Because the future
is in the now.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.524 align:middle line:84%
You change your timeline now,
and then the future is changed.

00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Stephen
Hawking, right?

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: That's right.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:20.360 align:middle line:84%
That's what this is
really all about.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.890 align:middle line:84%
There's never been a year in the
history of the human race that

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.775 align:middle line:84%
has been greeted with more
anticipation than 2012.

00:21:26.775 --> 00:21:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:28.195 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: OK?

00:21:28.195 --> 00:21:30.090 align:middle line:84%
There was a collective
consciousness

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.170 align:middle line:84%
was focusing in on a year in,
which never really happened

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.556 align:middle line:84%
And maybe 2000, the
year 2000 millennium.

00:21:37.556 --> 00:21:39.180 align:middle line:84%
But this was more of
a spiritual thing,

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.470 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't hooked to, like,
2 with three 0's behind it.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:43.530 align:middle line:90%
It was an odd year.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Why is the whole world getting
in such a ruff over this year?

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're concentrating
on the year,

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.722 align:middle line:84%
and we're saying to ourselves,
well, what do we want to be?

00:21:51.722 --> 00:21:53.430 align:middle line:84%
We're looking into
the future and saying,

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:54.346 align:middle line:90%
what do we want to be?

00:21:54.346 --> 00:21:56.090 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going to be?

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:57.540 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to be?

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's never
happened before.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that's going
on here which cannot be denied

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:07.160 align:middle line:84%
is that exactly 20 years
ago, one baktun ago,

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.480 align:middle line:84%
in 1992 was also the
beginning of the internet,

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:84%
which has just destroyed the
old paradigms completely.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Just as surely as
Gutenberg's press

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.250 align:middle line:84%
destroyed the Catholic Church
and in the royalty of Europe,

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:23.370 align:middle line:84%
so too will the internet destroy
the politicians and the bankers

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:84%
and everything that's
going on today.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.720 align:middle line:84%
So the internet has not
smartened us up yet,

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.420 align:middle line:84%
but it's putting us on
the road to smartening up.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.900 align:middle line:90%
That's what's really going on.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:37.080 align:middle line:84%
We will achieve wisdom,
collective wisdom,

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.780 align:middle line:90%
by 2020, 2025.

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.421 align:middle line:84%
The world is going to be
very, very different place.

00:22:42.421 --> 00:22:43.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It has to be.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: It will be.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: If the frequencies
of the planet are changing,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:84%
if we're going through a literal
dimensional or subdimensional,

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:52.250 align:middle line:84%
depending on who you listen
to, shift to a higher order,

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.630 align:middle line:84%
you can't be on the planet
unless you keep in step

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:55.950 align:middle line:90%
on a vibrational level, right?

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:90%
So consciousness has to change.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: I would think that
maybe a lot of people are going

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.615 align:middle line:84%
to die, actually, because
they're not going to be able

00:23:01.615 --> 00:23:04.290 align:middle line:84%
to handle the
changes and the vibe.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:08.510 align:middle line:84%
But for us, it's going to be--
the ones who are greeting it

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:11.110 align:middle line:84%
with exaltation and
enthusiasm, it's

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.780 align:middle line:84%
going to be a really
wonderful world.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's my message is
greet it with happiness,

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.630 align:middle line:84%
because there's nothing
you can do about it.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: Get in there
and try to change it.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So get
excited about it--

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Exactly.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --and then dream
about what's on the other side

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:23.330 align:middle line:90%
of this period of time.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: What can we do here?

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I totally
agree with you.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.730 align:middle line:84%
We've talked a little
bit about the Maya.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.720 align:middle line:84%
John Major Jenkins also
felt that this was not

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:84%
going to be a tipping
point in terms

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:37.280 align:middle line:84%
of physical cataclysm but
an internal consciousness

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.490 align:middle line:84%
cataclysmic event
that would then

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.250 align:middle line:84%
help us transform
ourselves, right?

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:41.586 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:41.890 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That was his.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
Jose Arguelles,

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.410 align:middle line:84%
because he's really
central to this story,

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and we love what he
brought to the world.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.880 align:middle line:90%
He's no longer with us now.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah, he is.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Jose was a-- People
get irritated by Jose,

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:55.470 align:middle line:90%
or they did when he was alive.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And I would always
say, you know what?

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.600 align:middle line:84%
You're not approaching
Jose the right way.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.850 align:middle line:90%
Jose is an artist.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:01.725 align:middle line:90%
He's not a scientist.

00:24:01.725 --> 00:24:02.433 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:24:02.433 --> 00:24:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: This is art.

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:04.260 align:middle line:90%
This is art.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:09.390 align:middle line:84%
You're judging art
by the same premium

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:90%
that you judge science or truth.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:12.440 align:middle line:90%
This is art.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:17.020 align:middle line:84%
This is consciousness
transmuted through art,

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.280 align:middle line:90%
and his books are works of art.

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And so Jose was brilliant
at evoking the intuitive

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.960 align:middle line:84%
nature of 2012 and what's
going to happen here

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.385 align:middle line:84%
on a not just indigenous
but deep down in the heart.

00:24:34.385 --> 00:24:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And he knew what
was going to happen,

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:84%
so he created his books and
his calendars and things

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.230 align:middle line:84%
so that this transition
would be easier.

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Was Jose always
correct on everything?

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:45.090 align:middle line:90%
No, he wasn't.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:46.060 align:middle line:90%
None of us are.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.480 align:middle line:84%
But was he in his
heart showing us

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.900 align:middle line:84%
the path towards what
we want to be post-2012?

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:53.910 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:57.370 align:middle line:84%
We want to do the moon
calendar is a brilliant idea.

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:59.820 align:middle line:84%
We should be going back
to the cycles of the moon,

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.930 align:middle line:84%
getting away from the
solar calendar, which

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:03.314 align:middle line:90%
is what he advocated.

00:25:03.314 --> 00:25:05.730 align:middle line:84%
All the things that he was
talking about-- the destruction

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.110 align:middle line:84%
of the capitalist
system is going

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.830 align:middle line:84%
to happen-- the whole
thing is going to happen.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:13.050 align:middle line:84%
It's just not going
to be quite as

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.260 align:middle line:90%
easy as Jose made it out to be.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And Jose was really-- we
have to remember, too,

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:22.790 align:middle line:84%
that everything that's been left
for us is in the form of art.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.136 align:middle line:84%
The artists were the
visionaries and the mystics.

00:25:25.136 --> 00:25:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: They are.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so he
came in, his purpose.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.650 align:middle line:84%
He understood his purpose,
what now, 55, 60 years ago

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:34.310 align:middle line:84%
when he almost was
nailed to the ground when

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:36.010 align:middle line:84%
he first experienced
Machu Picchu

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:38.137 align:middle line:84%
and knew what his
life was about,

00:25:38.137 --> 00:25:39.720 align:middle line:84%
what he was supposed
to bring forward.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And as an artist, a
brilliant artist and poet,

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.100 align:middle line:84%
I think he did a
world of service

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.980 align:middle line:84%
in creating the
beautiful view of what

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.117 align:middle line:90%
the potential is in this.

00:25:48.117 --> 00:25:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: I agree.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the thing you
talked about a bit ago, too--

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.690 align:middle line:84%
I did an interview with him just
before he died about calendar,

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and I asked him this, and he was
a little taken back to answer.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Jose, when you
speak of the Gregorian calendar

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.750 align:middle line:84%
versus the Mayan
calendar, he said

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.582 align:middle line:84%
the problem is it
puts us completely out

00:26:07.582 --> 00:26:08.540 align:middle line:90%
of sync with ourselves.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: That's right.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You can't have
unnatural cycles and still feel

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.690 align:middle line:84%
any internal
coherence of rhythm.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And then he said-- I said to
him, was this done by design?

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Were there those who were
intending to keep humanity out

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:25.530 align:middle line:84%
of our own rhythm, and thus
your commitment to promoting

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:28.360 align:middle line:84%
the Mayan calendar and
natural cycles of life?

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.667 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yes, I do
believe those people did it

00:26:31.667 --> 00:26:32.250 align:middle line:90%
intentionally.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: I agree.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Do you?

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:34.748 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah, I do.

00:26:34.748 --> 00:26:36.520 align:middle line:10%
I think that they
have done everything

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.710 align:middle line:10%
they can, whoever they are,
to throw us out of nature,

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:43.160 align:middle line:10%
to get as far away from
nature as possible.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.100 align:middle line:10%
If I didn't know better,
I'd say the people

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.320 align:middle line:10%
that run the world hate nature,
I mean absolutely hate it,

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.550 align:middle line:10%
just hate it.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:50.670 align:middle line:90%
They think it's dirty.

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:51.470 align:middle line:90%
It's filthy.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:52.530 align:middle line:90%
It's got insects.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:53.460 align:middle line:90%
It gets you dirty.

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.780 align:middle line:90%
The food is bad.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:55.369 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:26:55.369 --> 00:26:57.660 align:middle line:84%
I think there's something
wrong with the people running

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:02.040 align:middle line:84%
the world, and they have
no feeling for nature.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: And they
don't care about nature.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.758 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We did this interview
recently with Jim Robbins,

00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:10.060 align:middle line:84%
just our connection with
the trees, with the air,

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.250 align:middle line:84%
with the water alone,
this is our tuning fork.

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:16.210 align:middle line:84%
This is what allows us to
open up and blossom even

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:19.120 align:middle line:84%
intuitively, no less keep
the rest of our systems

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:19.927 align:middle line:90%
alive and healthy.

00:27:19.927 --> 00:27:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go to
a break in just a minute,

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:23.468 align:middle line:84%
but I'll just add
one little thing.

00:27:23.468 --> 00:27:25.560 align:middle line:84%
We had Laura Alden Kamm
on recently, who is really

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.640 align:middle line:84%
quite-- she has quite an
ability to see beyond timelines

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and such, and she was
talking about this,

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.820 align:middle line:84%
that we're sitting
at this precipice.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.330 align:middle line:84%
You talked about this
choice point a moment ago.

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:40.590 align:middle line:84%
One choice is we can keep
being lazy, as you call it,

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and go down this
technological chute

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:45.740 align:middle line:84%
to this dry,
nature-denuded future,

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:49.880 align:middle line:84%
or we can start feeling
our own hope and potential

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:90%
and go the other way.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.244 align:middle line:90%
And she has an opinion on that.

00:27:53.244 --> 00:27:54.910 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about that
when we come back.

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:58.300 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back in just a sec.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.462 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the next evolution
of Conscious Media Network.

00:28:01.462 --> 00:28:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Some of you have been with
us throughout our journey.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And now, as a result of our
partnership with gaiamtv.com,

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:84%
we're able to reach
more independent,

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:11.590 align:middle line:90%
progressive thinkers like you.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:14.170 align:middle line:10%
In addition to the hundreds
of interviews for CMN,

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.180 align:middle line:10%
I'm now able to do twice as
many interviews each month

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.250 align:middle line:10%
with the leading visionaries
and authors of our time.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:23.750 align:middle line:10%
This is possible because of
Gaiam TV's genuine commitment

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:27.275 align:middle line:10%
to preserve and expand this kind
of groundbreaking information.

00:28:27.275 --> 00:28:29.650 align:middle line:10%
>> JOAN BORYSENKO: I have a
great deal of faith that this

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.870 align:middle line:10%
universe is a friendly place.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In fact, gaiamtv.com
is destined to become

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.900 align:middle line:84%
the largest portal
of conscious media,

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.374 align:middle line:90%
intended to awaken and inspire.

00:28:38.374 --> 00:28:40.540 align:middle line:10%
>> JEAN HOUSTON: We don't
just live in the universe.

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.159 align:middle line:10%
The universe lives in us.

00:28:42.159 --> 00:28:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I could not be
happier with this partnership

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:46.689 align:middle line:84%
and the possibilities that
lie ahead for all of us.

00:28:46.689 --> 00:28:49.230 align:middle line:10%
>> DR. JOE DISPENZA: Most people
really are thinking the same

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:52.460 align:middle line:10%
way every day, acting the same
way, and feeling the same way,

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.630 align:middle line:10%
but really hoping something
will show up differently

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.104 align:middle line:10%
in their life,
and it never does.

00:28:56.104 --> 00:28:58.520 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Other well-known
faces in the alternative media

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.110 align:middle line:10%
scene will also be collaborating
with gaiamtv.com to provide

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:03.230 align:middle line:10%
even more perspectives.

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:06.350 align:middle line:10%
>> RICHARD C. HOAGLAND: Did
the Mayans understand about

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:09.130 align:middle line:10%
hyperdimensional
torsion field physics?

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.160 align:middle line:90%
I think I can prove they did.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In addition to my
live interviews from Gaiam TV

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.060 align:middle line:84%
studios, Scott and I will still
be traveling around the world

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.352 align:middle line:90%
for other exclusive interviews.

00:29:19.352 --> 00:29:21.726 align:middle line:10%
>> HARVEY BIGELSEN: You've
got pharmaceutical commercials

00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:23.470 align:middle line:10%
telling you go to
see your doctor this,

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:25.810 align:middle line:10%
go to tell your doctor that.

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:26.894 align:middle line:90%
It's a brainwashing.

00:29:26.894 --> 00:29:29.310 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Meanwhile, I wanted
to give you a quick preview

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:32.650 align:middle line:10%
of gaiamtv.com so you can see
what's being made available

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:34.829 align:middle line:10%
for you as a result
of this partnership.

00:29:34.829 --> 00:29:36.620 align:middle line:10%
>> MICHAEL TELLINGER:
This is a late 1400s.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.100 align:middle line:10%
When they asked the
local African tribes who

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.580 align:middle line:10%
built these structures, the
answer was we don't know.

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Now that is not what you'll
read in history books today.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.660 align:middle line:90%
I have a big problem with that.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You'll find curated,
consciousness-expanding films,

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:53.880 align:middle line:84%
thought-provoking documentaries,
engaging TV shows,

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.950 align:middle line:90%
and much more.

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Please join us for
the next evolution

00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.870 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness media.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:14.570 align:middle line:90%


00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:15.112 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:30:15.112 --> 00:30:17.695 align:middle line:10%
And just because we left you on
a little bit of a cliffhanger,

00:30:17.695 --> 00:30:19.390 align:middle line:10%
the one thing that
Laura said that day--

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:21.224 align:middle line:10%
and we'll get
into, at the end, I

00:30:21.224 --> 00:30:22.890 align:middle line:10%
want to hear your own
assessment of this

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:27.310 align:middle line:10%
as well-- is she sees us,
at this point in 2012,

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:29.410 align:middle line:10%
she sees the high road
actually winning out.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.920 align:middle line:84%
When she looks
beyond timelines, she

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.910 align:middle line:84%
doesn't see that
we're going to end up

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:36.560 align:middle line:84%
down that chute, down the
the technological chute.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:41.590 align:middle line:84%
She sees us rising to it,
which that's good news.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: I really
hope that's true.

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.950 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:46.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm working very hard in my own
life to make sure that's true.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.490 align:middle line:84%
They, the people
running the world,

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.660 align:middle line:84%
however, really seem
to want to go down

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.400 align:middle line:90%
the techno crypto fascist route.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:52.975 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:30:52.975 --> 00:30:54.680 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean we
have to follow, right?

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: No, we don't.

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:56.055 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This world is full--

00:30:56.055 --> 00:30:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: And that's
what Gaiam TV's about.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.118 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --of rebels.

00:30:58.118 --> 00:30:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:00.790 align:middle line:90%
Now there are many other events.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's quickly go
through and talk

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.270 align:middle line:84%
about the Hopi
and the Blue Star.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:08.230 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about what that
is within this 2012 matrix.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:12.500 align:middle line:10%
>> WEIDNER: Well, the Hopi say
that at the end of the cycle

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:16.330 align:middle line:10%
a blue star called the
Kachina will come into the sky

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:19.313 align:middle line:10%
and shine at night, and
you'll be able to see it.

00:31:19.313 --> 00:31:23.420 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people have
wondered what that is.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Paul LaViolette says that it's a
safer explosion from the center

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.560 align:middle line:84%
of the galaxy, which
is just a brightening

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.150 align:middle line:84%
up of the center of the galaxy,
which will look like an eye

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and will be blue because it
will be in that color shift.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And that fits in well with
what the Cross of Hendaye says.

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And a little bit complicated,
but the center of the galaxy

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:51.290 align:middle line:84%
is 26,000 lightyears
from the Earth.

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So that means it takes
26,000 years for the light

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.500 align:middle line:90%
to hit our eyes, right?

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:00.750 align:middle line:84%
The precession of
the equinox, the time

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.340 align:middle line:84%
that it takes the Earth
to go through one loop

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.350 align:middle line:90%
is 26,000 years.

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:09.910 align:middle line:84%
260, which is a
harmonic of 26,000

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:13.110 align:middle line:90%
is the sacred Mayan number, OK?

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:15.420 align:middle line:84%
260 days is how
long it takes you

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.724 align:middle line:84%
to gestate inside
your mother's womb.

00:32:18.724 --> 00:32:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we're talking
about the process of creation.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: We are.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: As above, so below.

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:23.768 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Absolutely.

00:32:23.768 --> 00:32:29.880 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans knew that the 260 was
the sacred number of gestation,

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and so the 26,000 years is the
gestation of the human race.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.825 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
about this was

00:32:36.825 --> 00:32:39.965 align:middle line:84%
is that Ben Franklin did
a magic square in which

00:32:39.965 --> 00:32:43.530 align:middle line:84%
every single-- a magic square
is where you have eight

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:47.260 align:middle line:84%
by eight, like a chessboard,
and then numbers are in it,

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.780 align:middle line:84%
and every single
row adds up to 260,

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.930 align:middle line:84%
no matter which
way you go in this.

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So he also, somehow,
knew-- possibly

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.360 align:middle line:84%
because he was connected with
the same group of people--

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:03.770 align:middle line:84%
knew that the 260 was associated
with this transformation.

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And the final
number is 26, which

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.040 align:middle line:84%
is also a harmonic
of this whole thing,

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.881 align:middle line:84%
with the number of
creation in the Kabbalah.

00:33:12.881 --> 00:33:13.380 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So we can see that there is
almost no doubt that there

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:21.710 align:middle line:84%
was an ancient worldwide
society that was extremely

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:25.310 align:middle line:84%
advanced that collapsed
somehow, and the remnants

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:29.890 align:middle line:84%
of that information were found
in Europe, were found in Peru,

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:32.510 align:middle line:84%
were found in America,
the United States,

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:37.140 align:middle line:84%
with the Cherokee and the Hopi,
in Mexico with the Mayans,

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.290 align:middle line:90%
in Tibet.

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:41.320 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetans also have
a prophecy about 2012.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And this society, this
ancient, advanced civilization,

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.040 align:middle line:84%
maybe not technologically
advanced, but spiritually

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.030 align:middle line:84%
advanced, knew that
something profound

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:54.147 align:middle line:84%
was going to happen right
now at this time period.

00:33:54.147 --> 00:33:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And when
you speak of that,

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:58.590 align:middle line:84%
maybe not technologically
advanced as we know technology.

00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Exactly.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:33:59.440 align:middle line:90%
That's what I meant.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They may have been
very technologically advanced,

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:04.670 align:middle line:84%
but they could, essentially,
achieve it all without the need

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:05.870 align:middle line:90%
for external stuff.

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: They didn't
need electricity.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.889 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They didn't need
electricity to do that.

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:09.409 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:13.979 align:middle line:84%
Now we talk about-- people start
confusing things sometimes--

00:34:13.979 --> 00:34:15.270 align:middle line:90%
and maybe it's not a confusion.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.659 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'm confused.

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:19.480 align:middle line:84%
The whole notion of
Nibiru coming through

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.090 align:middle line:84%
at roughly around
this time as well,

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:23.344 align:middle line:90%
does this fit into the story?

00:34:23.344 --> 00:34:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: It could.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:31.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what to make of
Nibiru because of the problems

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:34.809 align:middle line:90%
with gravitational pull.

00:34:34.809 --> 00:34:37.540 align:middle line:84%
If it kept coming through
every 3,600 years,

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.199 align:middle line:84%
our solar system would
be really scrambled up.

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:43.159 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of scrambled up,
so there is some evidence

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:45.210 align:middle line:90%
that something bad is going on.

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:48.600 align:middle line:84%
But I think more likely the
asteroid belt was a planet,

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and it blew up, and that
caused the scrambling--

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, just for--

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: --of
the solar system.

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.848 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --anyone out there
who's waiting for Nibiru--

00:34:54.848 --> 00:34:55.639 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Nibiru.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --to come and whack
us one and basically knock us

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:03.730 align:middle line:84%
off-kilter and kill us all, also
there are some phenomena that

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:05.590 align:middle line:90%
exists within the cosmos.

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:07.410 align:middle line:90%
There's attraction, repulsion.

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:10.860 align:middle line:84%
We don't bump into each other
cosmically for a reason.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: That's right.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We have
protections in place.

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: We do.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.805 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we really
shouldn't be-- personally,

00:35:15.805 --> 00:35:18.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm not focusing whatsoever
on having something basically

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.100 align:middle line:90%
smash into us at this point.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: Tom Van
Flandern, he's an astronomer.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:26.260 align:middle line:84%
His book about the fifth
planet blowing up and causing

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:29.640 align:middle line:84%
all the wackiness in the solar
system, very likely a big chunk

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.380 align:middle line:84%
of that planet
could have gone off

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:35.802 align:middle line:84%
into a long elliptical orbit
and be the Nibiru by now.

00:35:35.802 --> 00:35:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But we don't have
to sit and wait for it to come

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:38.900 align:middle line:90%
colliding.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: I would advise
everyone to not wait

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.162 align:middle line:90%
for a catastrophe from without.

00:35:43.162 --> 00:35:44.620 align:middle line:84%
I would worry about
things that you

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:45.630 align:middle line:84%
have to worry about,
like what are you

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:47.550 align:middle line:84%
going to do about your
life, your family,

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.480 align:middle line:84%
your spiritual life,
and that kind of thing.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:50.995 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Much more important.

00:35:50.995 --> 00:35:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: That's
the kicker, actually,

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.310 align:middle line:90%
when we get down to it.

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:56.085 align:middle line:84%
Still, as we're
talking historically,

00:35:56.085 --> 00:35:57.470 align:middle line:90%
let's talk about the Egyptians.

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:59.272 align:middle line:84%
Where did this show
up in Egyptology?

00:35:59.272 --> 00:35:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.280 align:middle line:84%
That's really the
most fascinating thing

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.770 align:middle line:84%
is that it's called
the Zep Tepi, which

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:06.850 align:middle line:90%
is Egyptian for the first time.

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptians have
a fresco hieroglyph

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:15.350 align:middle line:84%
which shows the four
signs of the zodiac

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:17.660 align:middle line:84%
exactly as we know them,
except that Scorpio

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.980 align:middle line:84%
is an eagle instead
of a scorpion, which

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.300 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what it
was 2,000 years ago.

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:25.200 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a scorpion;
it was an eagle.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And so it has a man, a
lion, a bull, and an eagle,

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.560 align:middle line:84%
and it calls this
the first time.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, those four symbols are the
four fixed signs of the zodiac.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:44.300 align:middle line:84%
The lion is Leo, the bull is
Taurus, the man is Aquarius,

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:48.210 align:middle line:90%
and the eagle is Scorpio.

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:50.930 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting about that
is that those are the four faces

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel sees in
the Old Testament

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and also the four faces that
John sees, John the Divine,

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.140 align:middle line:90%
in the Apocalypse.

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
both intimating is

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:08.140 align:middle line:84%
that when we go into one
of these four fixed signs,

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.010 align:middle line:84%
you better buckle
your seat belt.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So which sign are we
in, which of the fixed signs?

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: We're
going into Aquarius.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:13.550 align:middle line:84%
We probably already
have passed into it.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, Age of Aquarius.

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.868 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: Aquarius
is very interesting,

00:37:15.868 --> 00:37:18.900 align:middle line:84%
because it's the only one
that's a man-- or a human.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.730 align:middle line:84%
She or he, depending
on how you look at it,

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:24.859 align:middle line:90%
is carrying a vase of water, OK?

00:37:24.859 --> 00:37:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Water is not only
the only thing that

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.100 align:middle line:84%
activates DNA, which
implies some kind of shift,

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:37.610 align:middle line:84%
like the 260 implies a shift,
but also the secret of alchemy

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:42.810 align:middle line:84%
has been predicted to return
when man can figure out

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:45.710 align:middle line:84%
how to make the elixir
out of a vase of water,

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:49.300 align:middle line:84%
the elixir of life, the
elixir of longevity.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:49.820 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So if, say, the
secret of longevity

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:58.200 align:middle line:84%
was discovered around
this time period, which

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:02.410 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you is
very likely, think

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:05.020 align:middle line:84%
what would happen if
tomorrow you woke up

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.540 align:middle line:84%
and you found Angelina
Jolie on YouTube advertising

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.630 align:middle line:84%
that she had been
given a white powder--

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.025 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was just
going to ask you about it.

00:38:12.025 --> 00:38:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: --and she
hasn't aged 10 years.

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:14.610 align:middle line:84%
You would, of course,
immediately buy the powder.

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're talking
about the white gold, ORMUS.

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: I am.

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:16.336 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:16.336 --> 00:38:18.355 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: It's not ORMUS.

00:38:18.355 --> 00:38:21.267 align:middle line:84%
It's an electrolyte that
is very easy to explain,

00:38:21.267 --> 00:38:22.850 align:middle line:84%
and maybe we'll do
another show on it.

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:25.020 align:middle line:84%
But what would
happen to the world

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.960 align:middle line:84%
if suddenly everybody
lived to be 400 years old--

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.400 align:middle line:90%
and it was cheap?

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:29.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:30.880 align:middle line:90%
There'd be no more war.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.470 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking nobody's
going to go fight in any wars,

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:34.820 align:middle line:90%
if they got another 340--

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There would
health care reform.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: There would
be health care reform.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:38.613 align:middle line:84%
No one would be
polluting, because you

00:38:38.613 --> 00:38:42.000 align:middle line:84%
got to drink that water
250 years from now, OK?

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Your life would take on an
essence of-- all that anxiety

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:48.710 align:middle line:84%
that everyone feels
would disappear,

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:50.161 align:middle line:84%
because you got
a long way to go.

00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Life is long.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Long.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
not short anymore.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.998 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: You take 50
years to go to college.

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:56.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't have children
until you're 140.

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:59.690 align:middle line:84%
So that could be the
progenitor of the Golden Age,

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.860 align:middle line:90%
just a simple thing like that.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Fulcanelli assures us
that this does exist,

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and Canseliet saw
him when he was 140,

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and he looked like
he was about 40.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So I believe we're on the
edge of this discovery

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and that that discovery
alone could do it,

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:18.670 align:middle line:84%
could change everything,
change the way

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:21.060 align:middle line:84%
we look at the world
and everything.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:25.530 align:middle line:84%
So alchemy and all of
this is all intertwined.

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:27.200 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
about all of this

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.480 align:middle line:84%
is this is the first
time in history

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.400 align:middle line:84%
that you can talk about
the elixir of life

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.280 align:middle line:84%
and alchemy openly
on TV and not have

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:37.080 align:middle line:84%
to worry about going in
front of the Inquisition,

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.770 align:middle line:84%
not have to worry about
being burned at the stake.

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't
care about us anymore.

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:44.500 align:middle line:84%
They think what we
talk about is stupid,

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.067 align:middle line:84%
that we're all a bunch of
retards, and we're not.

00:39:47.067 --> 00:39:48.650 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
something serious,

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:50.130 align:middle line:90%
but they're discounting us.

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.080 align:middle line:84%
That's the perfect
moment for us to strike.

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.823 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: When we have
the internet on our side,

00:39:54.823 --> 00:39:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and we have their own
stupidity on our side.

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what's about to happen.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.810 align:middle line:84%
I think a bunch
of things are all

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:03.080 align:middle line:84%
going to come out at once,
free energy, longevity.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, they're poised.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's already there.

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: It is.

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's only
lacking support, funding.

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:09.390 align:middle line:90%
And also, I think--

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Publicity.

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --scientists, they're
still getting past the Dark

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:16.151 align:middle line:84%
Ages, in which the darker
forces, the Black Ops,

00:40:16.151 --> 00:40:18.650 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call them,
arms of various governments,

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:22.770 align:middle line:84%
would simply kill them on
behalf of the corporate interest

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:24.202 align:middle line:84%
to keep certain
industries going.

00:40:24.202 --> 00:40:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Absolutely.

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we know that we're
ending that period of time now.

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And we know from our own work
there is almost no device that

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:33.659 align:middle line:90%
hasn't already been created.

00:40:33.659 --> 00:40:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: That's right.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.520 align:middle line:84%
What we have to do is
we have to say, OK,

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.647 align:middle line:84%
if you have the elixir
of life, release it.

00:40:38.647 --> 00:40:39.480 align:middle line:90%
Release it for free.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: If you've got
free energy, release it.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Release it for free.

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:44.850 align:middle line:84%
The time of getting money for
these things is long gone.

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I think a lot
of the people we know are doing

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:47.470 align:middle line:90%
that now.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: They are.

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're just saying,
hey, I know time is short.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: It is short.

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When it comes to this
transition and taking this road

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:55.980 align:middle line:84%
versus this road, time
does feel short to them.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: That's right.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:58.138 align:middle line:84%
I want to address that
just for a second.

00:40:58.138 --> 00:41:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Because, you see,
there's something

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:05.580 align:middle line:84%
funny about the Golden Age in
which you get the knowledge,

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:09.260 align:middle line:84%
you have an epiphinal moment,
and you get the knowledge,

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.480 align:middle line:84%
but like a dream you
start forgetting it

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.807 align:middle line:90%
as soon as you get it.

00:41:12.807 --> 00:41:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
built the Pyramids

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:15.473 align:middle line:90%
and the Gothic cathedrals.

00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:17.732 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to ensconce
this stuff in rock

00:41:17.732 --> 00:41:18.940 align:middle line:90%
so that they don't forget it.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:22.333 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: So we could hit this
point and then immediately go

00:41:22.333 --> 00:41:24.270 align:middle line:84%
into kind of amnesia
and begin forgetting.

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:28.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important for
us to really pound it home

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.489 align:middle line:90%
that this is happening.

00:41:29.489 --> 00:41:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is
the golden moment.

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:32.613 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: This is
the golden moment,

00:41:32.613 --> 00:41:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and everybody out there has to--
really has to take the chain

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.930 align:middle line:90%
and grab it and pull it.

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Because if we all go
do it at the same time,

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:45.410 align:middle line:84%
then the insurance
that it will happen

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:48.040 align:middle line:84%
is more increased, whereas
if we don't work together

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and we rule by the Old
World standards of greed,

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:53.507 align:middle line:84%
then we're for sure going
to be in a catastrophe.

00:41:53.507 --> 00:41:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And yet,
when you say that,

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:58.812 align:middle line:84%
we know most people watch
the networks or cable TV--

00:41:58.812 --> 00:42:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: They
shouldn't be doing that.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --rather
than Gaiam TV.

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: That's right.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But Gaiam TV, we're
relatively new on the scene,

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:07.120 align:middle line:84%
and we're getting support
increasing by the day.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.649 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless,
the average person

00:42:08.649 --> 00:42:10.190 align:middle line:84%
isn't aware of a
lot of these things.

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:12.440 align:middle line:84%
So that brings us to the
subject of the tipping point.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And tell me
your feelings on that.

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:16.900 align:middle line:84%
There've been books written
about the tipping point.

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:17.880 align:middle line:90%
What are the percentages?

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.338 align:middle line:84%
Gregg Braden was
doing that-- what?

00:42:19.338 --> 00:42:21.940 align:middle line:84%
10, 15 years ago--
in one of his books.

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:25.132 align:middle line:84%
What is your take on the
tipping point phenomenon?

00:42:25.132 --> 00:42:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, that brings me
to another subject

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:30.540 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to
talk about, which

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:34.060 align:middle line:84%
is an historical book called
"The Fourth Turning" by Howe

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:34.590 align:middle line:90%
and Strauss.

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:36.480 align:middle line:90%
It came out in the '90s.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.525 align:middle line:84%
What they did was they
realized-- don't forget,

00:42:38.525 --> 00:42:39.900 align:middle line:84%
the Inca told--
the Q'ero told me

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.780 align:middle line:84%
it was going to start
in the United States,

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.100 align:middle line:84%
this thing was going to
start in the United States.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, what Howe and
Strauss done was

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:49.900 align:middle line:84%
they realized that every 85
years, or every generation,

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.830 align:middle line:84%
the United States goes
through a revolution.

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:54.840 align:middle line:90%
1776, we had a revolution.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.680 align:middle line:84%
85 years later, we
had the Civil War.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.860 align:middle line:84%
85 years later, we had the
Great Depression, World War II.

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.115 align:middle line:90%
And 85 years later is--

00:43:01.115 --> 00:43:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Now.

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: --now.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And they predict what's going
to happen to the United States

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:07.420 align:middle line:84%
in this time period
20 years ago,

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:08.932 align:middle line:84%
and they say that
about 2008 they're

00:43:08.932 --> 00:43:10.390 align:middle line:84%
going to have an
economic collapse.

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:11.245 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now
they're not into--

00:43:11.245 --> 00:43:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: They're
not spiritual.

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --Mayan
cosmology or anything else?

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.025 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Just historians.

00:43:14.025 --> 00:43:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:15.079 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Right?

00:43:15.079 --> 00:43:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And they say that absolutely
incredible, possibly even

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.060 align:middle line:84%
violent revolution could
happen in the United

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:27.720 align:middle line:84%
States between 2008 and 2020--
notice that 2012 falls right

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:30.010 align:middle line:84%
in there-- and
that this is going

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:32.750 align:middle line:84%
to be the humdinger
of all of them,

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:37.090 align:middle line:84%
that all the previous three
turnings, the revolution

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:40.960 align:middle line:84%
against Europe, the freeing of
the slaves in the Civil War,

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.430 align:middle line:84%
and then the centralized
banking, which

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:45.670 align:middle line:84%
caused the Depression,
all these things are

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:47.600 align:middle line:84%
going to come to
play, and we're going

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.040 align:middle line:84%
to work it out in
the fourth turning.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And that is done
by the internet,

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and that's how we
know everything

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:54.140 align:middle line:90%
that's going to be happening.

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.540 align:middle line:90%
We know now about currency.

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.861 align:middle line:84%
We know what the Fed is
really doing with our money.

00:43:57.861 --> 00:43:59.360 align:middle line:84%
We know that we're
being ripped off.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Transparency
is beginning.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: And everybody-- all
the intelligent people on Earth

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:09.340 align:middle line:84%
all are reaching the same
conclusions about reality all

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.630 align:middle line:84%
at the same time
because of the internet.

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And that is going
to push it over.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.390 align:middle line:90%
That's the turning point.

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:18.720 align:middle line:84%
I call it the rebellion
of the intelligent.

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:22.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be 40%
or 80% of the people.

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:24.410 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
about 5%, and they're

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:26.240 align:middle line:90%
going to be the smartest people.

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're on the internet
right now every day,

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:32.120 align:middle line:84%
and they're going, damn,
I'm getting mad about this.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:35.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm figuring this out, and
it's not making me happy.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:35.930 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:38.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm realizing there's a
whole lot of other people

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:39.830 align:middle line:84%
that are just like
me figuring it out,

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:41.230 align:middle line:90%
and they're not very happy.

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we, the leading
edge of this group,

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:48.280 align:middle line:84%
are going to say
enough's enough.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And we will have a collective
wisdom at that point

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:55.040 align:middle line:84%
where we will say, listen,
centralized power is not

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.360 align:middle line:90%
a smart move.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Dropping depleted
uranium on children

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.370 align:middle line:90%
is not really very wise.

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Having centralized
banking is stupid.

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:07.264 align:middle line:84%
Having GMOs on all these
things is not smart.

00:45:07.264 --> 00:45:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're reaching all these
conclusions at the same time.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.370 align:middle line:84%
The corporate world
is freaking out.

00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:15.780 align:middle line:84%
They stopped Prop 37 by dropping
almost $50 million into it.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.095 align:middle line:90%
That means we're winning.

00:45:17.095 --> 00:45:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain Prop 37
for those who don't know.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: Prop 37 is
the anti-GMO labeling law.

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:23.480 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't saying outlawing GMOs.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.820 align:middle line:84%
It was merely saying that
they should be on a label.

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Right?

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And still they spent almost
$50 million to destroy it.

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:30.500 align:middle line:90%
That means we're winning.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:33.160 align:middle line:84%
That means that they have
to be reduced to corruption

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and bribery in order
to get their way.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.210 align:middle line:84%
They can no longer convince
us through propaganda.

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:40.555 align:middle line:84%
We are winning this war,
and we are going to win it.

00:45:40.555 --> 00:45:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's true.

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:43.013 align:middle line:84%
It seems that the
subtleties are gone,

00:45:43.013 --> 00:45:44.450 align:middle line:84%
the subtle
manipulations are gone,

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and now it's
bludgeoning people--

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: They are.

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --bullying
and bludgeoning.

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah, like
the war with Iran.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: It used
to be very subtle.

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they have nuclear weapons.

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:51.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's go get them.

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:53.120 align:middle line:90%
Nobody buys that anymore.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: We bought
that with Iraq.

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.380 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work.

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So now they're trying all
sorts of different things,

00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:57.670 align:middle line:90%
and none of that's working.

00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, none
of it is working.

00:45:59.250 --> 00:45:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: No.

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:01.000 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's-- before-- I want to
get into some of the biblical

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:07.351 align:middle line:84%
references in Revelations
and all that about this time

00:46:07.351 --> 00:46:07.850 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:10.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's go first
to Nostradamus.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.300 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yep.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:20.240 align:middle line:84%
The most famous quatrain of the
last 200 years of Nostradamus,

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I think it's 4-72, and
it's-- the king of terror--

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to paraphrase.

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a quatrain, it's
a four line prophecy.

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:36.860 align:middle line:84%
The king of terror-- In
7/1999, the king of terror

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.250 align:middle line:84%
shall reign in the
skies, and war will come.

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So in September, 7-- sept
is 7-- September of 1999,

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:48.530 align:middle line:84%
we're all waiting for
this thing to happen,

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:51.644 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't happen, because
none of Nostradamus' quatrains

00:46:51.644 --> 00:46:52.810 align:middle line:90%
are what you think they are.

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, they were
also done in an encoded way.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Exactly.

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because this
was during the Inquisition.

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: He didn't
want to get found out.

00:46:57.370 --> 00:46:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: OK.

00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:59.284 align:middle line:84%
But also he's
trying to teach you

00:46:59.284 --> 00:47:00.995 align:middle line:84%
that psychic
ability is possible.

00:47:00.995 --> 00:47:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: Because you don't
know the quatrain until after

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:03.560 align:middle line:90%
it's happened.

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: OK?

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:05.100 align:middle line:90%
So it came and went.

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:06.785 align:middle line:84%
We're like,
Nostradamus was wrong.

00:47:06.785 --> 00:47:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:12.880 align:middle line:84%
So then we go up forward two
years to September, 2001,

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and a king of terror
did come from the skies,

00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:16.480 align:middle line:90%
and war did come.

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.230 align:middle line:90%
So was he two years off?

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:19.670 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:20.900 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't two years off.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.190 align:middle line:90%
He was disguising the quatrain.

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:27.570 align:middle line:84%
So you take the
year 7/1999, right?

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Invert the 1, the
9, the 9, and the 9,

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:32.890 align:middle line:90%
and it becomes 9, 1, 1, 1.

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:33.390 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:35.098 align:middle line:84%
You have to do a little
bit of inversion,

00:47:35.098 --> 00:47:36.780 align:middle line:90%
but he picks the date perfectly.

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:41.040 align:middle line:84%
9/11/2001, the king of terror
shall come from the skies,

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.100 align:middle line:90%
and war will come.

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:45.370 align:middle line:90%
That was his 2012 quatrain.

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:47.990 align:middle line:84%
That was his warning
about this time period,

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:51.260 align:middle line:84%
that this time period would
start with that event,

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:54.790 align:middle line:84%
that that event was going to
cause the catastrophe that

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:57.010 align:middle line:84%
was going to lead to
what he called the Great

00:47:57.010 --> 00:48:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Bifurcation, where the human
race splits into two, one

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:04.380 align:middle line:84%
completely asleep, following
the owls, one completely awake,

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:06.330 align:middle line:90%
following the roosters.

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What do you then--
since you brought it up--

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:13.420 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to-- but the
notion of the split world,

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:17.370 align:middle line:84%
the notion of the two Earths--
this is something that Dolores

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Cannon has gotten into
quite a bit in her work,

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:23.760 align:middle line:84%
and in the 1980s a certain
one of esoteric circles I was

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.080 align:middle line:84%
associated with at that time--
that was something that came up

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:27.960 align:middle line:90%
then 30 years ago--

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:28.835 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Oh, yeah.

00:48:28.835 --> 00:48:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --which was already
people are beginning to migrate

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:34.440 align:middle line:84%
to one world or the
other and that--

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and this is important
to note in that--

00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:38.329 align:middle line:84%
that another world
has been created.

00:48:38.329 --> 00:48:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: It has.

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We don't all have to
incarnate to the same planet.

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And the other world
has very carefully

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:47.480 align:middle line:84%
been created for this period
of time in which, as you say,

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:52.710 align:middle line:84%
this species would go through
kind of a consciousness split.

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And what was told to me
30 years ago about that

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.690 align:middle line:84%
is not to look on
that as a bad thing.

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:01.800 align:middle line:84%
It was simply a time-- It's
as though you're taking people

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.192 align:middle line:84%
that are in a classroom
with one level of knowledge

00:49:04.192 --> 00:49:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and another level of
knowledge and you're

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.739 align:middle line:84%
making two classrooms, and
there's no punishment in that.

00:49:08.739 --> 00:49:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: That's right.

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.405 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There's
grace in everything.

00:49:11.405 --> 00:49:13.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a chance to
continue learning

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:14.652 align:middle line:90%
what you need to learn.

00:49:14.652 --> 00:49:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.250 align:middle line:84%
The 12th graders have to be
tolerant of the 2nd graders.

00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:19.251 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:49:19.251 --> 00:49:21.166 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: Because
they're not really stupid;

00:49:21.166 --> 00:49:22.240 align:middle line:90%
they just don't know.

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.782 align:middle line:84%
Ignorance is simply
just to not know.

00:49:24.782 --> 00:49:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's up to us, the
rebellion of the intelligent,

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:30.070 align:middle line:84%
the intelligent people
who are beginning

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:33.300 align:middle line:84%
to figure all this out, to be
extremely tolerant and patient

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.520 align:middle line:84%
with those people
who don't understand.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So when you're going home
over the holidays or whatever,

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:41.900 align:middle line:84%
just because your relatives
are dumb as a bag of rocks,

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:45.124 align:middle line:84%
you have to just
slowly help them along.

00:49:45.124 --> 00:49:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I want to say
something about that.

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I got in this conversation
recently about someone

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:54.340 align:middle line:84%
near and dear, and she appears
to not be as, certainly,

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:57.140 align:middle line:84%
well-educated on
a lot of things.

00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:02.160 align:middle line:84%
But what this person
has is our holy grail.

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:05.110 align:middle line:84%
She has no judgment and
love and compassion.

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:06.894 align:middle line:84%
She has one of the
most pristine hearts.

00:50:06.894 --> 00:50:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yep.

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Everybody makes
fun of her for having little

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.120 align:middle line:90%
knowledge.

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And I look at that and
say, hold on a minute.

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:15.540 align:middle line:84%
The raising of the
frequencies has

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:18.630 align:middle line:84%
to do very much with what's
happening on a frequency

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:20.320 align:middle line:90%
heart-generated level.

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.980 align:middle line:90%
She has that in spades.

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:25.330 align:middle line:84%
If she never learned
a thing about 2012

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:27.380 align:middle line:84%
or any of this stuff
we do here at Gaiam,

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:28.770 align:middle line:90%
she's already ahead of most.

00:50:28.770 --> 00:50:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Oh, I know.

00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:30.003 align:middle line:90%
I get so frustrated.

00:50:30.003 --> 00:50:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I'll meet somebody who
will be channelling,

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and they'll know
absolutely nothing.

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Yet their channeling is
absolutely perfect for what

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:40.580 align:middle line:84%
30 years of my scholarly
research has found.

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:43.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, why
didn't I just sit

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:45.780 align:middle line:84%
down in the lotus
position 30 years

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:47.340 align:middle line:84%
ago and just start
channeling, and I

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:49.900 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have to read the
10,000 books that I read?

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:51.515 align:middle line:90%
But everybody has a different--

00:50:51.515 --> 00:50:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It
comes down to that.

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: --way, yeah.

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:53.375 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's great
to be brilliant.

00:50:53.375 --> 00:50:54.660 align:middle line:90%
It's great to have a great mind.

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:56.118 align:middle line:84%
But in the end,
the only thing that

00:50:56.118 --> 00:50:58.960 align:middle line:84%
takes you through a transition
into a higher frequency

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.350 align:middle line:84%
is being of a higher frequency,
which always comes back

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:02.492 align:middle line:90%
to love and nonjudgment.

00:51:02.492 --> 00:51:03.825 align:middle line:90%
And that gets us to Revelations.

00:51:03.825 --> 00:51:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yep.

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.425 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
Revelations, and we'll

00:51:06.425 --> 00:51:08.050 align:middle line:84%
bring a little of
Rocco Errico into it.

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:08.758 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:51:08.758 --> 00:51:10.280 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
about Revelations

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:12.130 align:middle line:84%
is what most people
don't realize

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:14.390 align:middle line:84%
is that the Book of
Revelation was not

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:16.110 align:middle line:90%
written by John of Patmos.

00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:19.220 align:middle line:84%
It was a best-seller, believe
it or not, at that time,

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and it was written by
Isis the Prophetess.

00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:26.270 align:middle line:84%
It was written 500 years before
John of Patmos even existed.

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:28.090 align:middle line:90%
500 BC it was written.

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was a prophecy
for the future written

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:33.840 align:middle line:84%
by this prophet,
this Egyptian woman,

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and it was called the
Revelation of Isis and Osiris.

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you read Revelation,
the woman on the moon,

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:44.311 align:middle line:84%
the crescent moon and all
the symbols, that's all Isis.

00:51:44.311 --> 00:51:45.310 align:middle line:90%
He's talking about Isis.

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And the Catholic Church
has these treatises saying,

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.364 align:middle line:90%
what is he talking about?

00:51:49.364 --> 00:51:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Obviously he's
talking about Isis,

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:53.694 align:middle line:84%
and you guys don't know
what you're talking about.

00:51:53.694 --> 00:51:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: So 500
years before Jesus,

00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:01.940 align:middle line:84%
this woman came forth with all
these revelations about what

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:05.850 align:middle line:84%
would happen, and she
specifically says that this

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:10.170 align:middle line:84%
gigantic change that's going to
happen is going to happen when

00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:12.290 align:middle line:84%
the angel with four
faces shows up.

00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:16.650 align:middle line:84%
The four faces are the four
fixed The next fixed sign

00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:21.420 align:middle line:90%
after 2500 BC is Aquarius.

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:23.590 align:middle line:90%
So she's talking about then.

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:26.250 align:middle line:84%
The next time that
this happens, this

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:29.660 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the time,
the greatest time, the Zep

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Tepi, the first time.

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:33.640 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
it repeats itself.

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.505 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And when
you talk about that--

00:52:35.505 --> 00:52:38.280 align:middle line:84%
a bit ago you were talking about
the fact that Aquarius shows

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.440 align:middle line:84%
itself symbolically
as the water bearer,

00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and you were talking about
the DNA and the white powder

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:46.670 align:middle line:84%
and the ways in which we're
going to begin utilizing

00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:50.800 align:middle line:84%
the fluids within our body
and without in a new way--

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.160 align:middle line:90%
could it also mean deluge?

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: It could.

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:55.649 align:middle line:90%
And like I said--

00:52:55.649 --> 00:52:57.981 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm just saying
because it's happened before,

00:52:57.981 --> 00:53:00.582 align:middle line:84%
just about shaking and rattling
and tsunamis and that kind

00:53:00.582 --> 00:53:01.790 align:middle line:90%
of thing, is that part of it?

00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:03.748 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: We're going
through that right now.

00:53:03.748 --> 00:53:06.275 align:middle line:84%
There's more earthquakes
and tsunamis and hurricanes

00:53:06.275 --> 00:53:08.860 align:middle line:84%
that are bigger
than ever before.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:11.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't really think it's
mandate global warming.

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:12.960 align:middle line:84%
I think it has to
do with the sun.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.060 align:middle line:84%
The sun literally goes
through a 26,000-year cycle,

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:20.821 align:middle line:84%
and it heats up and it cools
down and changes color and all

00:53:20.821 --> 00:53:21.320 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going
through that right now.

00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:25.920 align:middle line:90%
The sun is white.

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:28.250 align:middle line:84%
When I was young,
the sun was yellow.

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:30.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm a photographer, and
I used to have to use--

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A lot of people
talk about this, by the way.

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Oh, yeah.

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:33.170 align:middle line:90%
It's white now.

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:37.100 align:middle line:84%
It has definitely changed
color in 40 or 45 years

00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:38.770 align:middle line:84%
since I've been
photographing the sun.

00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:41.040 align:middle line:84%
I have to use filters
now, neutral densities

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:41.950 align:middle line:90%
to tone it down.

00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:44.240 align:middle line:84%
The sun is brighter
than it used to be.

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the sun-- we know that
white is hotter than yellow,

00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:49.120 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So the sun is heating
up somehow, some way,

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:52.394 align:middle line:90%
for some reason.

00:53:52.394 --> 00:53:54.685 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we know the
sun is central to this theme

00:53:54.685 --> 00:53:56.044 align:middle line:90%
of 2012 and our transition.

00:53:56.044 --> 00:53:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Of course it is.

00:53:57.210 --> 00:53:58.810 align:middle line:90%
It's the time of the fifth sun.

00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it does affect
the waters of the planet

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:02.260 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:03.301 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: That's right.

00:54:03.301 --> 00:54:04.480 align:middle line:90%
And as above, so below.

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:05.105 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:54:05.105 --> 00:54:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: So the sun
gets angry, we get angry.

00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:09.660 align:middle line:84%
The sun doesn't get
angry, we don't get angry.

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think the sun is in
an angry phase right now,

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:14.562 align:middle line:90%
a catastrophic phase.

00:54:14.562 --> 00:54:16.270 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean
it's going to last.

00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:20.440 align:middle line:84%
It will cool down again,
and we'll go back to normal.

00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now we get into
looking more toward how this

00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:28.710 align:middle line:84%
blend of information from
the past comes together.

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:30.280 align:middle line:84%
We've already touched
on a lot of it.

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:30.988 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:54:30.988 --> 00:54:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And Global Coherence
Project, Howard Martin's work,

00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:36.540 align:middle line:90%
I find really key in--

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Great stuff.

00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:39.038 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --all of this,
because, as we were talking

00:54:39.038 --> 00:54:41.880 align:middle line:84%
about earlier, 30 years
ago, even before that,

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:45.800 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years ago, it
was understood that our own

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:49.310 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, our own
levels of compassion and love

00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and appreciation can
affect larger systems now.

00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:56.590 align:middle line:84%
They've set up these
devices, these antennas

00:54:56.590 --> 00:54:59.650 align:middle line:84%
of sorts that are able
to start discerning what

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:03.610 align:middle line:84%
the frequencies-- they're
taking the resonant frequencies,

00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:06.600 align:middle line:84%
having people project their
feelings and thoughts,

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and watching what's happening
to the resonant frequencies

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.340 align:middle line:90%
of the land.

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Talk a little bit about this,
because this is really critical

00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:14.701 align:middle line:90%
to understand the power we have.

00:55:14.701 --> 00:55:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: It is.

00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:20.000 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that the word
earth is an anagram of heart.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:23.236 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: And then we think
about what the Q'ero told me

00:55:23.236 --> 00:55:26.050 align:middle line:84%
about going from the brain
to the heart as we're in this

00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:26.690 align:middle line:90%
transition.

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we're
people of the brain,

00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:30.170 align:middle line:84%
like we are in
the United States,

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and somebody from a
Native American tradition

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:35.650 align:middle line:84%
is telling us that the heart is
more important than the brain,

00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:37.608 align:middle line:84%
we're obviously going to
say you're full of it.

00:55:37.608 --> 00:55:40.050 align:middle line:84%
The brain is obviously
superior to the heart.

00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:42.900 align:middle line:84%
But then a guy like
Martin comes along,

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and he, using brain stuff,
proves that actually the heart

00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:49.810 align:middle line:84%
is more important
than the brain.

00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, then the brain finally
has to relent and say, wait

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:53.400 align:middle line:90%
a minute.

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:55.910 align:middle line:84%
I've been proven by brain
stuff that the heart is

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:59.710 align:middle line:84%
more important than the brain
so that I've got to believe it.

00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:02.280 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
there's going to be--

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:05.620 align:middle line:84%
and they're already happening--
future intentional experiments

00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:08.656 align:middle line:84%
via the internet where
we create mass resonance.

00:56:08.656 --> 00:56:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
this is happening.

00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: It is happening.

00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Global Coherence
is doing some of this--

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Absolutely.

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --and there
are other groups doing it.

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: We need to have
thousands of groups doing it.

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:16.510 align:middle line:90%
It should be going on every day.

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:18.594 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
is one of the ways

00:56:18.594 --> 00:56:21.010 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to-- I don't
want to use the word defeat,

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:23.285 align:middle line:84%
because it makes it
sound like a war.

00:56:23.285 --> 00:56:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Transcend.

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: Transcend
the powers that be.

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And Jose Arguelles
used to say that 2012

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:34.350 align:middle line:84%
is like you're in a pot of
boiling water on the stove,

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:37.570 align:middle line:90%
and it's boiling furiously.

00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:42.004 align:middle line:84%
You're that water, and you're
like, what am I going to do?

00:56:42.004 --> 00:56:43.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm boiling-- getting
hotter and hotter.

00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:44.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm not boiling
furiously, I'm getting

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.215 align:middle line:90%
hotter and hotter and hotter.

00:56:46.215 --> 00:56:48.048 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden,
you hit boiling point,

00:56:48.048 --> 00:56:48.920 align:middle line:90%
and what happens?

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:51.390 align:middle line:84%
You turn into steam,
and you transcend out

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:53.820 align:middle line:84%
of your predicament
into another state

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:56.000 align:middle line:90%
of energy, another vibration.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.380 align:middle line:90%
That's where we are right now.

00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:00.114 align:middle line:84%
We're transcending,
and it's not easy.

00:57:00.114 --> 00:57:01.155 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's not easy.

00:57:01.155 --> 00:57:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: No.

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's not easy,
because it means letting go

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.860 align:middle line:84%
of everything familiar,
everything we know of--

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: It does.

00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:07.641 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --not only each other
but ourselves and our world.

00:57:07.641 --> 00:57:09.110 align:middle line:90%
We have to simply let go.

00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:10.819 align:middle line:84%
And that's the famous
prophecy, isn't it?

00:57:10.819 --> 00:57:11.568 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: It is.

00:57:11.568 --> 00:57:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The Hopi prophecy.

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.990 align:middle line:90%
You let go.

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:16.450 align:middle line:84%
You find yourself
swept down the river

00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:19.350 align:middle line:84%
after you let go of the
reeds, and you look around,

00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:22.029 align:middle line:84%
and you see who's there
with you, and you celebrate.

00:57:22.029 --> 00:57:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: That's right.

00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:26.400 align:middle line:90%


00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.320 align:middle line:84%
What I think is
going to happen now

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:34.810 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to go to a
19th century rural world

00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:37.260 align:middle line:90%
with 20th century technology.

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:39.020 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
our iPads, and we're

00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:40.517 align:middle line:90%
going to go back to the country.

00:57:40.517 --> 00:57:42.100 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
back into the woods.

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:44.530 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go back
into growing our own food.

00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:46.666 align:middle line:84%
We're going to demand
community, pure water.

00:57:46.666 --> 00:57:48.790 align:middle line:84%
We're probably going to
pull the plug on-- there'll

00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:51.756 align:middle line:84%
be no television, because
everything will be internet.

00:57:51.756 --> 00:57:53.880 align:middle line:84%
There'll be no colleges
anymore, because everything

00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:55.550 align:middle line:84%
will be taught
through the internet

00:57:55.550 --> 00:57:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and through indigenous
ways of community teaching.

00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And as my friend
Gregg Braden likes

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.830 align:middle line:84%
to say, we're going to come
out the other end of this,

00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:08.413 align:middle line:84%
we're all going to
look at each other,

00:58:08.413 --> 00:58:11.890 align:middle line:84%
really look at each other with
an embarrassed expression,

00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:13.705 align:middle line:84%
and say, what the
heck were we doing?

00:58:13.705 --> 00:58:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What
were we thinking?

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: What were
we thinking back then?

00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But the nice thing
is this is becoming the common

00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:21.160 align:middle line:90%
view.

00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:23.160 align:middle line:84%
I ask people all the time,
I've been asking them

00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:25.450 align:middle line:84%
for many years, how
do you see it going?

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And now-- for a long
time there-- I'd

00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:30.617 align:middle line:84%
say even five years ago-- there
were a lot of fence-sitters,

00:58:30.617 --> 00:58:32.700 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not seeing a lot
of fence-sitters anymore.

00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: They're
not allowed anymore.

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:34.593 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:58:34.593 --> 00:58:36.600 align:middle line:84%
There's a tipping point
that is occurring,

00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:39.920 align:middle line:84%
because each of the people,
and myself included when I do

00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:42.980 align:middle line:84%
my own internal journeys-- what
I see of the future is more

00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:46.980 align:middle line:84%
like if you want to use the word
1,000 years of peace or however

00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:50.360 align:middle line:84%
many thousand years of peace,
but I see the very same thing,

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:53.370 align:middle line:84%
this whole going back into
nature and being responsible

00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:55.585 align:middle line:84%
for food, being responsible
for our health care--

00:58:55.585 --> 00:58:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Children.

00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --taking care
of ourselves, our children.

00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We have only
a few seconds left.

00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:04.080 align:middle line:84%
What's your final
wisdom on this?

00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>> WEIDNER: As my Irish
grandmother used to say,

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:09.110 align:middle line:84%
may ye be alive at
the end of the world.

00:59:09.110 --> 00:59:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: [LAUGHS]
There you go.

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:13.200 align:middle line:84%
We hope you've
enjoyed this overview

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:16.190 align:middle line:84%
of the historical roots of
the visions regarding 2012.

00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:17.735 align:middle line:10%
