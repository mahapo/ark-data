>> REGINA MEREDITH: Belinda
Womack is back with us again

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:90%
by popular demand.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.170 align:middle line:10%
In our last
conversation, we spoke

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.480 align:middle line:10%
about how she came into
contact with her angels,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.290 align:middle line:10%
and the lovely messages they
imparted to her and to us.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Today, we'll speak about
broader opportunities that

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.150 align:middle line:84%
are available in these
fascinating and challenging

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.760 align:middle line:84%
times, from the reformation
of our societies,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.344 align:middle line:84%
to love, to the most important
belief we could each hold.

00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:52.760 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I just want
to thank you for coming back.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.120 align:middle line:90%
That was so fun last time.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.430 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't just fun.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.570 align:middle line:90%
It was meaningful.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.440 align:middle line:84%
You hold a level of frequencies
that is very, very rare.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And I know I shared off-camera
a little bit about what

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:84%
someone else had said
about your work, which

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.370 align:middle line:90%
I found fascinating.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.664 align:middle line:84%
And that was their
girlfriend had

00:01:09.664 --> 00:01:12.080 align:middle line:84%
come in contact with your book
after seeing our interview.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.871 align:middle line:84%
They said, did you
interview an angel lady?

00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is someone who does
the David Hawkins calibration

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.270 align:middle line:84%
method, which is a
form of calibrating

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.610 align:middle line:84%
the truthfulness or
the consciousness

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:84%
in anything, really, and been
doing it for many, many years.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:90%
Lovely soul.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said, my girlfriend
came home with this book

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:84%
from some angel lady
you interviewed.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I calibrated it.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.930 align:middle line:84%
He said, that was in the top
two or three most highest levels

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness of
any spiritual text

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.400 align:middle line:90%
he had ever calibrated.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I just wanted
to share that with you

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.010 align:middle line:90%
because that I can feel in you.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And you say, oftentimes,
people think,

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:90%
oh, it's such simple messages.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about that, how
people respond to your work.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:10%
>> BELINDA WOMACK: Well, so I
feel so blessed, first of all,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:10%
to be back on "Open Minds,"
so thank you so much.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.130 align:middle line:10%
And so I'm a channel for
these amazing 12 archangels.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.410 align:middle line:10%
Their whole message is to
deliver the message of love

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.920 align:middle line:10%
as if we truly are
five-year-olds because that's

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:10%
the way they see us.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.310 align:middle line:84%
They see us as innocent children
that sometimes are very lost

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:90%
on our way.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.780 align:middle line:84%
But they love us, and
they're guiding us

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.960 align:middle line:90%
through this School Room Earth.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.340 align:middle line:84%
They're helping us to understand
that we're really just here

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:90%
to learn what love is.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And as we do that,
we are learning

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.640 align:middle line:90%
for all of the universe.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
being human beings.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:84%
It's about the whole
incredible collective

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.420 align:middle line:90%
of all of God's cosmos.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.800 align:middle line:84%
So their messages
are the vibration

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.360 align:middle line:84%
of love given to us
to move us forward,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.310 align:middle line:84%
out of our grief and
our suffering, back

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:90%
into Heaven on Earth.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the messages to
five-year-olds are generally

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.330 align:middle line:90%
very direct and simple.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.140 align:middle line:84%
But-- and I said this last
time-- when I read your book,

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.650 align:middle line:84%
I felt a level of refinement
in it that is very rare.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, it
would be, considering

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.430 align:middle line:90%
the nature of the beings.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And right down to
the colors that

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.010 align:middle line:84%
are chosen for each of these
elegant little meditations

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:84%
in the book, very,
very powerful because

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.790 align:middle line:84%
of the refined level of the
information coming through.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's combined
with the feelings,

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.630 align:middle line:84%
the thoughts, the imagery, the
colors used in the imagery.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.230 align:middle line:90%
It all goes together.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not just one piece.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And though it
sounds quite simple,

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:84%
it's not, just for us to
get in and really hold that,

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.652 align:middle line:90%
the hardest of all being love.

00:03:51.652 --> 00:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And especially-- which is why
I wanted to do this interview

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.070 align:middle line:90%
with you--

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.750 align:middle line:84%
especially right
now in these times

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.230 align:middle line:84%
because I have never
experienced this nation

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.920 align:middle line:84%
certainly so polarized
as it is right now.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing missing
on both sides is love.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.870 align:middle line:84%
We're finding it hard to
dig down at this time.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And so with that, speaking
with you is a little different.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you go
into a different state,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.529 align:middle line:84%
close your eyes, and are
speaking with an accent

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:22.700 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.010 align:middle line:84%
It's that your
guides, the angels,

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.120 align:middle line:90%
are with you all the time.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.370 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to even have a
private conversation with you

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:84%
because they're talking
to you, and we almost

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.050 align:middle line:84%
have to limit it to watching
movies or something--

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.649 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] talking
about the movies.

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:84%
So we're just going to
have a conversation.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, people will see
your eyes will be roaming up

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.850 align:middle line:90%
to one side or the other.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And you're just
listening, and you're just

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.720 align:middle line:84%
bringing through what you're
being told in real time.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to
set that up because I

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.090 align:middle line:84%
want to begin by talking
with them about the greatest

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle line:84%
opportunity that's
being offered us

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:90%
in these most polarized times.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: So the message from
the 12 archangels is that this

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:84%
is such an exciting
time for humanity.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.380 align:middle line:84%
This is the time
when the shadow--

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.550 align:middle line:84%
that which has been ignored,
and shoved into the closet,

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.680 align:middle line:90%
and pushed into the basement--

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.140 align:middle line:84%
is rising up to the light so
that it can return to love.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Love is the greatest
transforming power

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.510 align:middle line:90%
in all of the cosmos.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So this time may
appear to be dark.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.380 align:middle line:90%
It may look like it's scary.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.510 align:middle line:84%
It may look like
just about everything

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.650 align:middle line:84%
that it's not because
what this time is about

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:90%
is that it's about healing.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.530 align:middle line:84%
It's about bringing
the past that humanity

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.000 align:middle line:84%
has buried in the
collective subconscious--

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.470 align:middle line:84%
bringing it up, lifting
up the vibration

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.630 align:middle line:90%
so that it can be transformed.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Human beings forget that
they are co-creators,

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:90%
like Mother-Father God.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.780 align:middle line:90%
They co-create.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.330 align:middle line:84%
They dream their
lives into being.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And what they
don't understand is

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:18.170 align:middle line:84%
that very often, the material
that they are using to create

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.210 align:middle line:90%
is from the past.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.170 align:middle line:90%
It's thoughts.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.130 align:middle line:90%
It's memories.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.950 align:middle line:90%
It's belief paradigms.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.730 align:middle line:84%
It's ancestral bits
of suffering and lack

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.790 align:middle line:84%
that have been-- again,
it's been shoved down

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:84%
under the rug in
the subconscious.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't know
that they're not victims.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:84%
They don't realize
how powerful they

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.020 align:middle line:84%
are because they
don't consciously

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:84%
understand that
they are creating

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.560 align:middle line:90%
their lives into being.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: From old
energy patterns.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Exactly, Regina.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.110 align:middle line:84%
From old energy patterns that
they've forgotten about because

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.820 align:middle line:90%
it's uncomfortable.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.430 align:middle line:84%
What human beings do is
that they have to survive.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:middle line:84%
So if it's unpleasant, like
rage, or suffering, or pain,

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.820 align:middle line:84%
or self-punishment,
self-loathing, guilt--

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.680 align:middle line:84%
all of those really heavy
duty emotions and thoughts

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.120 align:middle line:90%
that come from fear.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And remember, we're here to
learn how to work with love.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, in order to
survive and keep going,

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:84%
human beings put those
in the subconscious.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.630 align:middle line:84%
They put them down
into the basement.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.590 align:middle line:84%
But then that's what continues
to rise up and create

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.520 align:middle line:84%
exactly the situations
that humanity

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.350 align:middle line:90%
is experiencing right now.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So there is a higher
purpose to this time.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.640 align:middle line:84%
There is a higher orchestration
of the events that

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.820 align:middle line:84%
are happening on this
planet and in the United

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.990 align:middle line:90%
States of America.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.100 align:middle line:84%
It is a purging of
the subconscious.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:84%
It is a purging of the
old male paradigm--

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:05.270 align:middle line:84%
the control, the
judgment, the separation.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:12.110 align:middle line:84%
That's what fear does, is
it separates the human ego

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.480 align:middle line:90%
from the human soul.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to create that
fusion that really has always

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:25.080 align:middle line:84%
been of Heaven and Earth,
and heart and mind,

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:90%
the separation has to be purged.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.930 align:middle line:84%
It has to come out
into the light.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's just the way that
the Creator created School Room

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.400 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.399 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;> REGINA: Very true.

00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen evidence
across the board in this.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.289 align:middle line:84%
I think that we had
believed en masse,

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:47.330 align:middle line:84%
that we had reached if not a
spiritual level of civility,

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:84%
at least a cultural
level of civility.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.320 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, what we saw in
recent months was what you say.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.880 align:middle line:84%
The darker belief
patterns still held,

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.980 align:middle line:84%
whether it was racism, or
sexism, or whatnot, all

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:84%
starting to rise to the
surface, showing it never left.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.690 align:middle line:84%
We somehow just masked it
pretty well for a decade or two.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:09.590 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.030 align:middle line:90%
How can you heal anything?

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
It's like a wound if you don't
allow it to come up and be

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.850 align:middle line:90%
shown in the sun, right?

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Absolutely.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.160 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now we get a real
glimpse of what we're holding.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.780 align:middle line:90%
I love the way you put it.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.380 align:middle line:84%
This is a glimpse of our
subconscious mind en masse.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.310 align:middle line:90%
It It is.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.960 align:middle line:90%
It's just the past.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And the way that the angels
encourage us with love,

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and there's just so
much help for all of us.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And they say, if you can
just accept it's the past,

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:90%
let it go.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Let the past go
within your own being.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.280 align:middle line:84%
When you have those
thoughts come up

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:84%
in your own mind of the old
story of low self-esteem,

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:58.740 align:middle line:84%
or I'm not good enough, or I'm
not this enough, let it go.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:90%
That's the past.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.240 align:middle line:84%
You are a divine being,
every human being.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.460 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
12 archangels say.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.850 align:middle line:90%
You are a child of God.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Everything is happening
in divine order.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to make
a difference to what's

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:20.140 align:middle line:84%
happening in the big, outer
reality of the collective,

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.520 align:middle line:90%
look within.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention to
your own thoughts

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:90%
and to your own feelings.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And instead of saying,
oh, no, I feel guilty.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.620 align:middle line:90%
That's bad.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.210 align:middle line:90%
Or here I go.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid of money again.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.280 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.410 align:middle line:90%
Let it come up.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.650 align:middle line:90%
Breathe through it.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:42.070 align:middle line:84%
But surrender it back to
the central sun, which

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.290 align:middle line:90%
just means the heart of God.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Or put it in the color purple--

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.142 align:middle line:84%
the energy of your Crown Chakra,
or battery of spiritual energy,

00:10:51.142 --> 00:10:52.350 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call it.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But don't
stuff it back down

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.116 align:middle line:90%
into the subconscious.

00:10:54.116 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: But don't stuff it.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
what we're seeing.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the human
species, because we're young

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.930 align:middle line:84%
in many ways still
in our development,

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:90%
tends like all immature beings--

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.720 align:middle line:84%
and even in the animal kingdom
those who are less mature,

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.920 align:middle line:90%
and bullies, and so forth.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.250 align:middle line:84%
We tend to learn more,
it seems, from strife.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And so certain events
have to roll out

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.500 align:middle line:84%
in order for us to
wake up to the need

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.380 align:middle line:90%
for any kind of change.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible for earthlings
to learn any other way

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.570 align:middle line:90%
than through stress?

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Most definitely.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.370 align:middle line:84%
The 12 archangels say that
it's a choice that you make,

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.240 align:middle line:84%
and that what really
sort of steers

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:49.600 align:middle line:84%
that choice is that a very
shocking thing happened when

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.990 align:middle line:84%
the angels and the Creator
created this School Room

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Earth, that in the past was
called the School of Duality--

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:02.240 align:middle line:84%
no one knew that fear was
going to be so entertaining.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Explain that
a little bit better.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.020 align:middle line:84%
I think most of us do
know what you're saying,

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.850 align:middle line:84%
but I would like to
hear more from them.

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: So fear became so
exciting with all of the drama

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:16.970 align:middle line:84%
it creates, and
all of the strife,

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and the suffering because
suffering is a way

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:22.790 align:middle line:90%
for the little child within--

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:84%
because again, the angels see
all of us as little children--

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.860 align:middle line:90%
to get attention.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.980 align:middle line:84%
So what human beings
have learned how to do

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.690 align:middle line:84%
is to get attention
through suffering.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.070 align:middle line:84%
They've have learned to get
attention through strife.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:41.570 align:middle line:84%
That's what's on the news,
through the violence,

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.310 align:middle line:84%
and the hatred,
and the separation.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's the darkness
that gets attention.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And every little
child learns that.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Wow, if I scare
my little sister,

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.020 align:middle line:90%
then I might get in trouble.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.180 align:middle line:84%
I might get some
really good attention

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.230 align:middle line:90%
here from Mom and Dad.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I might be the
center of attention.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Human beings are an amazing
creation by the Creator.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And they were created
in the image of God.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.040 align:middle line:90%
So they love attention.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So the choice--
back to the choice.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.680 align:middle line:84%
How do you want to get
your attention, humanity?

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to get your
attention through joy,

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and prosperity, and abundance,
and love, and great sex,

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.190 align:middle line:90%
and good health, and longevity?

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Or do you want to
get your attention

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:84%
through drama, and fear,
and hatred, and illness,

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.870 align:middle line:90%
and separation?

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.090 align:middle line:90%
The choice is yours.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:84%
The angels say, the whole
incredible collective or team,

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.090 align:middle line:90%
the community of great beings--

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:54.540 align:middle line:84%
just means great, just
means greatly loving.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.510 align:middle line:84%
We are here walking with
you, holding your hands.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Your loved ones in heaven are
trying to nudge you, nudge you.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.270 align:middle line:90%
Let go.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.990 align:middle line:90%
Let go of the drama.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Get back on the spoke so
the spider doesn't bite you,

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.630 align:middle line:90%
so that you can enjoy--

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:15.860 align:middle line:84%
so that you can enjoy the
Heaven that is your birthright.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Heaven is not
boring, they tell us.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not boring.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.300 align:middle line:84%
You really are safe to let
go of the fear and the drama.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And create.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: And create from a
completely different vibration.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.800 align:middle line:90%
But that is our choice.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And yet we have these
incredibly active, beautiful,

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:84%
sometimes incredibly
invasive emotions.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And the emotions of
the human species,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.860 align:middle line:84%
when I've read
books of or spoken

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.900 align:middle line:84%
to other people who have
been to other realms,

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.240 align:middle line:90%
even other ET civilizations--

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:84%
the notion always
comes up that we

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.590 align:middle line:84%
seem to be unique
in our emotionality.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, maybe somewhat
addicted to it as well.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Can you have them talk about
the universality of emotion

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.550 align:middle line:84%
at large and the distinctness
of perhaps human emotion?

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: So it's
all about vibration.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:13.600 align:middle line:90%
Emotion is energy in motion.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Emotion comes from the divine
mother or the divine feminine.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So the divine masculine,
the male aspect of God,

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.950 align:middle line:90%
creates thought.

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But the divine mother,
she creates emotion.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.640 align:middle line:84%
So at the highest
vibration of love--

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.390 align:middle line:84%
or the highest frequency,
as you put it--

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:38.080 align:middle line:84%
love is the most
powerful creative force

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.300 align:middle line:90%
in all of the great cosmos.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:90%
It is what created planet Earth.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Mother Gaia, our Mother Earth,
is an archangel herself.

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And so we can see what the
divine feminine is capable of.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Now if we put in the
vibration of fear,

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:00.850 align:middle line:84%
just like with thought, and we
take that vibration of emotion,

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and we bring it
very, very low down,

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.930 align:middle line:84%
then we're very separated
from the mother.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.750 align:middle line:90%
And so we feel abandoned.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.910 align:middle line:84%
This is just a natural
response, and this

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:16.630 align:middle line:84%
is what human beings are
capable of experiencing.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a lie.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:19.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:84%
But we can experience
that God is far away

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and that there is no
Mother-Father for me.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So when that happens, we get
filled with rage and hostility,

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.150 align:middle line:84%
and then we feel
guilty about it.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And then we feel resentful for
the people that have the love

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.480 align:middle line:90%
that we think we're not getting.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to
experience what so

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:51.400 align:middle line:84%
much of the universe
and other civilizations

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.510 align:middle line:84%
get to experience, it's
all about vibration.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:59.740 align:middle line:84%
We honor our rage,
and our guilt,

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and our resentment,
and our shame.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Those are pretty much
the lowest we can go.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And again, we put them
in the color purple,

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.700 align:middle line:84%
or we just ask our angels to
fill these emotions with love.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.829 align:middle line:84%
We basically just have to
use our intention and say,

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:17.690 align:middle line:90%
I let these go.

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:20.030 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.505 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple to let it go.

00:17:22.505 --> 00:17:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And yet
they're so addictive.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: Well,
especially guilt.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.590 align:middle line:84%
The way the angels put
this, and I hope this is--

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.660 align:middle line:84%
they're in charge of
this conversation.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.618 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you know that.

00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Anything can be said.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: They say that
if there is a true devil,

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:44.950 align:middle line:84%
it's guilt because guilt locks
a human being up so that they

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.560 align:middle line:84%
don't even want to hear
their own thoughts.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.740 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to hear their
own feelings because they

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.510 align:middle line:90%
feel ashamed of it.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:84%
So if there's anything that
we can do, it is to say,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.600 align:middle line:84%
you know what, wherever
that guilt is in my cells,

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:84%
in my atoms, in
my consciousness,

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.080 align:middle line:90%
in my subconscious, I let it go.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Now the color purple,
that violet fire-- again,

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:13.210 align:middle line:90%
the energy of forgiveness--

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:90%
knows how.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the consciousness
of our Creator.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.110 align:middle line:84%
It knows how to suss out
the guilt in ourselves

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.750 align:middle line:84%
and transform it
for us immediately.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:25.950 align:middle line:90%
So if there is--

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:28.920 align:middle line:90%
we've mentioned a devil, right?

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.880 align:middle line:84%
So if there is a savior,
it is to let the love

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.740 align:middle line:90%
into our vessels.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the greatest
healing power there is.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.200 align:middle line:84%
To find that guilt,
to lift it up,

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.030 align:middle line:84%
and with it, all those
heavy duty drama--

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:49.530 align:middle line:84%
negative drama-loving
emotions will lift up.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:54.142 align:middle line:84%
And that makes room in
the human vessel for joy.

00:18:54.142 --> 00:18:55.225 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's so simple.

00:18:55.225 --> 00:18:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Yes, it is simple.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yet we have been
conditioned to believe anything

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.980 align:middle line:84%
good that could possibly happen
to us either has to be blind

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:90%
luck or it has to be merited.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:08.910 align:middle line:90%
You have to earn it.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
roll up your sleeves,

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.440 align:middle line:84%
and you're always falling short,
and never quite good enough

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:84%
to have merited these kinds
of blissful interventions,

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.941 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:19:17.941 --> 00:19:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Can they speak to
that for a moment?

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: So that's
the old male paradigm.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And paradigms are like the
way that the angels give us

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:33.730 align:middle line:84%
this wonderful simple imagery
to do a little exercise.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And that is to see your
mind as a great library.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And at the front desk is
a guardian angel librarian

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:44.770 align:middle line:84%
who is so ready to take
you to the old male room.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And in the old male room
are all of the books--

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The do's and don'ts.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: The indoctrinations
of when the masculine took

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:59.170 align:middle line:84%
the power away
from the feminine,

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.550 align:middle line:84%
which was part of our
evolution in our education.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.630 align:middle line:90%
We are in school here.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:10.120 align:middle line:84%
So part of our
education that we do

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.720 align:middle line:84%
for all of the universe, for all
of the souls in the universe,

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:19.330 align:middle line:84%
again, is to experience
separation from our Creator,

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.420 align:middle line:84%
to believe that our Creator
is outside of us, not inside

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:26.920 align:middle line:84%
of us, and that we live
outside of the Creator or God.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where the old
male paradigm was created.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:33.670 align:middle line:90%
It's the intermediary, right--

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:38.230 align:middle line:84%
because it's thoughts, so
that's the male part of this.

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:42.910 align:middle line:84%
So that male part of the way
our logical, rational hemisphere

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:47.440 align:middle line:84%
was designed to think says,
I need to be in control,

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and I need to be right,
and I need for things

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.780 align:middle line:90%
to make me look important.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.590 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
self-importance for the ego.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And when that ego needs to
have that self-importance,

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:84%
then that's what can create even
more separation between self

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.370 align:middle line:90%
and Creator.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So again, that old
male paradigm--

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.480 align:middle line:84%
it's simple to remove
if we're ready, is

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.060 align:middle line:84%
to go with our guardian
angel librarian and say,

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:29.070 align:middle line:84%
OK, all the old male stuff
that says, God is far away,

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:31.260 align:middle line:90%
and I'm here and I'm all alone.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.460 align:middle line:90%
And there's no blessings for me.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.350 align:middle line:90%
There is no support for me.

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.880 align:middle line:90%
I am all on my own.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.771 align:middle line:90%
Let's let that go, humanity.

00:21:43.771 --> 00:21:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what's that
look like once you've gotten

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.480 align:middle line:84%
into the patriarchy
wing of the library?

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.460 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with those books?

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: You call
on the 12 archangels.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is my
favorite approach.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.410 align:middle line:84%
You let archangel Michael,
who I call Big Blue--

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.840 align:middle line:84%
he takes that sapphire
blue sword of his

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.826 align:middle line:90%
and it turns into a blowtorch.

00:22:02.826 --> 00:22:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: [LAUGHS] I love it.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: And lies in our mind
turn to white ash immediately

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:14.220 align:middle line:84%
because if it's not truth
of the highest vibration,

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:90%
it's illusion.

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And once illusion
meets the truth,

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:22.670 align:middle line:84%
which is archangel Michael's
flame, it disappears.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:27.850 align:middle line:84%
So you just allow archangel
Michael to go at it.

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:29.980 align:middle line:90%
And then they sweep--

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.740 align:middle line:84%
all those amazing big angels,
and your guardian angels

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:90%
will come in.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:38.980 align:middle line:84%
They just sweep all of
that dust out your left ear

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:42.100 align:middle line:84%
because that represents
the past, the left side.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.670 align:middle line:84%
They say, this is in the past,
into a violent fire ocean

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:52.030 align:middle line:84%
of forgiveness because for
these old beliefs to really go,

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.540 align:middle line:90%
they must be forgiven.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.750 align:middle line:84%
We have to forgive
ourselves that we bought

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:59.210 align:middle line:84%
into it in the first place
because ultimately, there

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:01.300 align:middle line:90%
is a nugget.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:05.970 align:middle line:84%
There's a flame in every
human being that remembers

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:09.270 align:middle line:90%
that he or she is divine.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we are constantly
needing to forgive ourselves

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.400 align:middle line:84%
for being rather
stupid, actually.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you've
talked about purple,

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.270 align:middle line:84%
but you've also
talked about violet.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And then you have this
lovely kind of violet indigo

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.000 align:middle line:90%
you're wearing today.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:84%
So how specific do people
need to be about the color

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.540 align:middle line:84%
when they're invoking
this image in their mind,

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.020 align:middle line:84%
whether it's to go into the
violet river, or flame, or any

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.060 align:middle line:84%
of the number of violent
exercises in your book?

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Do they need to look up
Pantone color of violet?

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: They really just
need to hold the intention

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.790 align:middle line:84%
of the energy of their Crown
Chakra, which is violet.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Now if we get technical
in the rainbow,

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.330 align:middle line:84%
violet is the highest
vibration of that

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:58.110 align:middle line:84%
of the rainbows of color, and
so it does not have red in it.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:01.410 align:middle line:84%
But violet fire
actually does have

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:04.080 align:middle line:84%
the ruby flame, which is
the energy of the Root

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.580 align:middle line:90%
Chakra in it.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So the angels will
go back and forth

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.860 align:middle line:84%
between calling it
the violet flame

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and calling it the color
purple because they

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:14.760 align:middle line:90%
mean the same thing.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And purple is infused
with more red,

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.804 align:middle line:84%
and violet is infused
with a tad more blue.

00:24:19.804 --> 00:24:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: And it all works.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It all works.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.760 align:middle line:90%
That's good to know.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.040 align:middle line:84%
When you were
talking a moment ago,

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.800 align:middle line:84%
there's one thing that comes
up in a lot of my interviews

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.940 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of people--

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.750 align:middle line:84%
whether it's on the subject of
ETs, interdimensional beings,

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:34.860 align:middle line:90%
and so forth--

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and that is the notion that
because the human species

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.540 align:middle line:84%
is quite naive and young
in its growth cycle

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.150 align:middle line:84%
still, that there has
been certain interference

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:45.330 align:middle line:84%
or exploitation from
outside forces that

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:49.890 align:middle line:84%
have inspired us into certain
ways of being or thinking.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:53.130 align:middle line:84%
What do your beings
say about that?

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: So the
12 archangels--

00:24:56.010 --> 00:25:00.980 align:middle line:84%
first of all, they appreciate
that you asked this question.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.460 align:middle line:84%
They say, again,
that even this topic

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:08.000 align:middle line:84%
shows that human
consciousness sees

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.070 align:middle line:84%
that the rest of
the universe lives

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:14.090 align:middle line:90%
outside of their own being.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:17.180 align:middle line:84%
If you understand oneness
and you understand

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.200 align:middle line:84%
that nothing can leave
oneness, and that everything

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.120 align:middle line:84%
is held within the central
sun, the heart of God,

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:31.340 align:middle line:84%
then you can begin to understand
that if there has been

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:39.000 align:middle line:84%
any tampering with, or
interference, or invasion,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.120 align:middle line:90%
ultimately, it is from within.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And it is for the greatest
good of all concerned.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.620 align:middle line:84%
The Law of One rules
the universe, not just

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.030 align:middle line:90%
planet Earth.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And the Law of One
says that that which

00:25:54.120 --> 00:26:00.340 align:middle line:84%
is for the greatest good of all
particles of God's energy, that

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.890 align:middle line:90%
is what must be.

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:06.850 align:middle line:84%
So again, here on the
Earth, you are learning.

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Do you have teachers that appear
from all over the universe?

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:15.205 align:middle line:84%
Yes, absolutely, and
what a blessing that is.

00:26:15.205 --> 00:26:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And from all
realms, high and low.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Absolutely.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And isn't that marvelous,
the angels say.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because we do
learn through contrast.

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.790 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: That's why
this school was created--

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:33.310 align:middle line:10%
to learn, to learn from
opposites of light and dark,

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:36.910 align:middle line:10%
and male and female,
and good and evil,

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:38.560 align:middle line:10%
if you want to use those words.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.960 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, it's all about
energy, and it's all vibration.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's all about
how we choose to utilize that

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.500 align:middle line:84%
energy and express
it in the end--

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.280 align:middle line:84%
how we want to take
it in, transform it--

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:57.070 align:middle line:84%
because I do have some
issues about featuring

00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:00.640 align:middle line:84%
some of the stories
that I do that get

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.950 align:middle line:84%
into the darker forces,
the hidden forces

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:04.090 align:middle line:90%
because it scares people.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's just feeding
into the fright machine,

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.740 align:middle line:84%
and that's not really where
I feel we need to be going.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the same
time, I understand

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.200 align:middle line:84%
that some people
do begin their path

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:19.820 align:middle line:84%
of awakening through some
unique quality and fear.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: Well, so the angels'
response to that is, Regina,

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.540 align:middle line:84%
you are a being
of love and light.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And you are a great healer
of many, many incarnations.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So we ask of you to
listen to your heart,

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and that if you are
sharing a teaching that

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:48.580 align:middle line:84%
is founded in fear, to
balance it with love.

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And we are grateful
to you for doing that.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:55.840 align:middle line:84%
I do try to do that,
even in the dark topics,

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.160 align:middle line:90%
to show the silver lining of it.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.720 align:middle line:84%
But I am concerned about the
propagation of fear any longer.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.780 align:middle line:84%
It seems like we're at a
time-- a tipping point now.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:07.120 align:middle line:84%
We've created rather
frightful circumstances

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.590 align:middle line:90%
around the world--

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:11.770 align:middle line:84%
socially, politically, and
otherwise, not just in the US.

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems to me that
that elevation beyond fear

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:19.140 align:middle line:84%
is really more in
line with what--

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.140 align:middle line:90%
what are you hearing?

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.200 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.865 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: That fear is
falling out of fashion.

00:28:23.865 --> 00:28:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank God.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:25.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:27.426 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: The fear is
falling out of fashion.

00:28:27.426 --> 00:28:33.170 align:middle line:84%
The 12 archangels say, so we
helped to create this school.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And the education
has been phenomenal.

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:39.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's time for
humanity to graduate.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And And what humans don't
understand because of oneness

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:50.720 align:middle line:84%
is that all of the
people on your planet

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.710 align:middle line:90%
that are addicted to fear--

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:55.850 align:middle line:84%
as you said, fear can
be very addictive.

00:28:55.850 --> 00:29:00.440 align:middle line:84%
They actually are
all part of you.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:04.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to make a
difference-- and they say,

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.920 align:middle line:84%
we understand this
can be a little bit

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.430 align:middle line:84%
tough for the human
ego to understand.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:14.590 align:middle line:84%
But if you can see humanity
as one human body, and that

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:16.790 align:middle line:90%
the little finger has cancer--

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So the little finger has all
of this fear, and hatred,

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:24.760 align:middle line:84%
and darkness, and
separation, and old male,

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.480 align:middle line:90%
and bullies, and--

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.100 align:middle line:84%
but you don't want to
cut off the little finger

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.750 align:middle line:90%
because it's sick.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:35.440 align:middle line:84%
What you want to do is
stop telling it it's bad.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.200 align:middle line:90%
You are a bad little finger.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.000 align:middle line:90%
You are sick.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.166 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You deserve this.

00:29:39.166 --> 00:29:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: You are a
sick little finger.

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.895 align:middle line:84%
What you want to do
in the little finger

00:29:42.895 --> 00:29:45.730 align:middle line:84%
is a metaphor for the
little child, by the way.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So you want to understand that
if I fill that finger with

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:57.740 align:middle line:84%
love, and I fill it with
healing energy, and I own it--

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:01.330 align:middle line:90%
this is my little finger--

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:06.720 align:middle line:84%
then that is how you can heal
the collective human body,

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.460 align:middle line:90%
the one human body.

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.550 align:middle line:84%
That is how any
individual human being

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:16.360 align:middle line:84%
can make a profound
difference, is

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:22.060 align:middle line:84%
instead of going into separation
about your new president,

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:27.390 align:middle line:90%
as an example, focus on love.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:33.160 align:middle line:84%
It is the greatest power
in all of the cosmos.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And as we
talked about earlier,

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:38.440 align:middle line:84%
that this purging of the
subconscious that this has

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.770 align:middle line:84%
allowed to take place,
there is not a person--

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:45.646 align:middle line:84%
we may say, oh, this racism
that's come to the forefront.

00:30:45.646 --> 00:30:47.020 align:middle line:84%
But there's not
a person among us

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.137 align:middle line:84%
that hasn't judged someone else
based on something external.

00:30:50.137 --> 00:30:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: That is
very true because--

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We've all done it.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: Well, again,
if we understand oneness,

00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:01.390 align:middle line:84%
everyone that is out
there lives within us,

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:05.260 align:middle line:84%
either in a past life
or in our ancestry.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And again, we come
to the subconscious.

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.030 align:middle line:84%
What a human being
doesn't understand

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:13.000 align:middle line:84%
is sometimes the
thousands of lives

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.940 align:middle line:84%
they have lived and the
thousands of tens of thousands

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.610 align:middle line:84%
of ancestors that
they've had that go

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:24.650 align:middle line:90%
with those thousands of lives.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Some of
which they are, right?

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.070 align:middle line:84%
We are often a product of our
own ancestors, again and again.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Of course.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Reincarnating
into the same DNA pools

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:34.360 align:middle line:90%
and bloodlines.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Of course.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.330 align:middle line:90%
And so it's all within us.

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's also a safety
net for School Room Earth.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:46.150 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the design
of the school, so that

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.350 align:middle line:90%
those who are willing--

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:51.840 align:middle line:84%
as I believe many
in your audience

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.850 align:middle line:90%
are those who are willing.

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And I really want to acknowledge
the incredible people

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.120 align:middle line:84%
in your audience
and their courage.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Beautiful souls.

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: And powerful souls.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: So our message is,
remember you have the power

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.690 align:middle line:84%
because within you,
you have lived it.

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:15.490 align:middle line:90%
You have been everything.

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:16.780 align:middle line:90%
You have been the murderer.

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:20.020 align:middle line:90%
You have been the prostitute.

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.910 align:middle line:90%
You have been the racist.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:27.250 align:middle line:84%
You have been the
bereft, starving child

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:28.750 align:middle line:90%
in a foreign country.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:33.280 align:middle line:84%
You've been it all, or it
is with-- you have access

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.190 align:middle line:90%
to it within your own vessel.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:38.050 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do?

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:41.290 align:middle line:84%
You ask for your vessel,
your human vessel,

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:45.010 align:middle line:84%
to be filled with the color
purple of transformation

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and forgiveness, in every
cell, in every molecule,

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:51.670 align:middle line:84%
in every atom and space
between your atoms

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.440 align:middle line:90%
to be filled with love.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So taking
this conversation over

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:59.530 align:middle line:84%
to the influence of
events as they roll out--

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:04.334 align:middle line:84%
how one event affects another
event in history and so forth.

00:33:04.334 --> 00:33:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Recently, this has been
coming to my attention

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.339 align:middle line:84%
for some reason, in a
lot of different ways.

00:33:08.339 --> 00:33:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And it might have
to do with the fact

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.550 align:middle line:84%
that the period of time
we're in right now,

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:16.910 align:middle line:84%
apparently, astrologically has a
lot of overlays with the 1960s.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So I keep bumping into
scenarios, articles,

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:26.770 align:middle line:84%
recently a television
series called--

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:30.610 align:middle line:84%
this one was called
"11.22.63."--

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:32.470 align:middle line:84%
the day of the
Kennedy assassination.

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And this keeps coming
up into view, that--

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:41.200 align:middle line:84%
the question is, that
event that occurred

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:45.190 align:middle line:84%
changed our history in
the West, especially

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.710 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Some people look to it as the
day America took a dark turn,

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.720 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Many people feel
that way about it.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.889 align:middle line:90%
And it was a very, very sad day.

00:33:58.889 --> 00:34:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And yet, many people
are experiencing

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:01.830 align:middle line:90%
these same feelings now.

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So I have a double
question here.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.650 align:middle line:84%
One, was that event
in the '60s something

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:12.989 align:middle line:84%
that had to happen for a
particular agenda to roll out?

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Were souls chose to be
involved in this experience?

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Yes.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Can you please
share more with us?

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.830 align:middle line:90%


00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: Everything on School
Room Earth is orchestrated

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.239 align:middle line:90%
by your own higher selves.

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:34.480 align:middle line:84%
That means your soul
that stays in Heaven,

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:38.810 align:middle line:84%
you send a small part of
that to this vibration.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.560 align:middle line:84%
In order for the collective--
again the human body--

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.340 align:middle line:84%
to learn, there are
different events

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:51.380 align:middle line:84%
that are agreed to, such as
the Kennedy assassination,

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:55.210 align:middle line:84%
as well as 9/11,
and other events.

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:58.340 align:middle line:84%
They are orchestrated,
and people agree--

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:03.860 align:middle line:84%
they make contracts-- to
go through this segment

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.660 align:middle line:90%
of the movie.

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:10.340 align:middle line:84%
If you can step back and if
you can see that what happens

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.350 align:middle line:90%
in your world, it's a drama.

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:14.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a movie.

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And each one of you are
dreaming, you are thinking,

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:23.630 align:middle line:84%
and feeling into
reality your own reality

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:29.490 align:middle line:84%
that overplays and interacts
in the one big dream.

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:31.830 align:middle line:90%
Those of us, those beings--

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:35.280 align:middle line:84%
we are called the 12
archangels of the central sun.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:39.480 align:middle line:84%
We work together with all
of the ascended masters,

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:43.950 align:middle line:84%
the team that
supports the evolution

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.860 align:middle line:90%
of the consciousness of God.

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.840 align:middle line:84%
We work with each
of you individually

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and we work with the
collective human body

00:35:53.430 --> 00:36:00.770 align:middle line:84%
to help you to awaken,
to move through the past

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:05.600 align:middle line:84%
so that you can be
grounded in a new future.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what was the
silver lining or opportunity

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:12.650 align:middle line:84%
for learning in the loss of a
number of the Kennedy family,

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:15.540 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: The Kennedys.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.510 align:middle line:90%
We want to clarify this.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:26.920 align:middle line:84%
The Kennedys that
left your Earth

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.370 align:middle line:84%
remain very closely
attached to your school

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:33.370 align:middle line:90%
or connected to your school.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Forgive us for using
the word attachment.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:40.300 align:middle line:84%
That can have a negative
or fearful vibration.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Very often, great souls,
which some of the Kennedys

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:50.020 align:middle line:84%
are great souls that
incarnated, they

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.450 align:middle line:90%
will be here for a short time.

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And then they return to Heaven,
but they remain in service

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:57.560 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, the
universe is infinite.

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:07.220 align:middle line:84%
But just think of how important
the Earth is to the education,

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:11.300 align:middle line:84%
not just of human beings,
but to all of the universe.

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:16.150 align:middle line:84%
So the Kennedys are still
teaching, still helping

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:18.400 align:middle line:84%
to raise consciousness,
still pushing

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:25.380 align:middle line:84%
buttons, which was one of the
main reasons for what happened.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:30.710 align:middle line:84%
It was, again, to push buttons
in the subconscious that say,

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:31.550 align:middle line:90%
look at this.

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:33.530 align:middle line:90%
Look at what is happening.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And another important
point of your president

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:40.010 align:middle line:90%
and his assassin--

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:44.120 align:middle line:84%
excuse Belinda, sometimes
she has trouble with words--

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:50.390 align:middle line:84%
assassination is that
this man was also very

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:53.210 align:middle line:90%
judged for his personal life.

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And what came of his
death, as well as his life

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:03.650 align:middle line:84%
before that death, is it
helped to move humanity

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:06.320 align:middle line:84%
to a different
place of judgment.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.940 align:middle line:90%
Look at your current president.

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Look at the incredible
judgment, but also

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:17.390 align:middle line:84%
going past that judgment
of certain characteristics,

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:21.260 align:middle line:90%
character flaws, and qualities.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:26.630 align:middle line:84%
President Kennedy was very
influential in helping

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:31.040 align:middle line:84%
human consciousness
to open the book

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and not just look
inside the cover--

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:34.730 align:middle line:90%
not just look at the cover.

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And so that was our
opportunity for growth.

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:40.550 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, what followed

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:45.920 align:middle line:84%
appeared to be a few decades
of a darkening type of agenda,

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.740 align:middle line:84%
a feeling of, in
one way, almost more

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:50.990 align:middle line:90%
oppression of the human spirit.

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:54.110 align:middle line:84%
The loss even on a
level of education--

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:57.620 align:middle line:84%
of some of the more refined
beautiful aspects of education.

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:01.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like a darkening
across the doorway.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: So the
Dark Ages again.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.150 align:middle line:90%
We hear you.

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And we honor and respect
what you are sharing.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.170 align:middle line:84%
But again, from our
perspective, what

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:19.050 align:middle line:84%
we say to you is the darkness
has to come to the light

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:24.460 align:middle line:84%
before it can be transformed
so that it can be forgiven.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Now let us remind you of
why this school called

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:30.360 align:middle line:90%
Earth was created.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.510 align:middle line:90%
It was created.

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:35.280 align:middle line:84%
So that humanity--
not just humanity.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.530 align:middle line:84%
All of the universe
through humanity

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:39.990 align:middle line:90%
would learn the value of love.

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:42.490 align:middle line:84%
How do we learn
the value of love

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:45.850 align:middle line:84%
as souls to have
loved taken away?

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Loss.

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:47.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:49.667 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: The loss of love.

00:39:49.667 --> 00:39:51.000 align:middle line:90%
And there's been enough of that.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.290 align:middle line:90%
We've shared that with you.

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:57.060 align:middle line:84%
We are ready for this
experiment called duality

00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:00.710 align:middle line:90%
to be over in Earth time.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So what you refer to--
the refinement, the arts,

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:12.870 align:middle line:84%
the education, the higher
consciousness of humanity--

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:14.940 align:middle line:90%
it did not die.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.450 align:middle line:84%
But for some individuals,
and from the perspective

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:22.450 align:middle line:84%
of, again, the collective, it
looks like it has been lost.

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:25.340 align:middle line:90%
It has not been lost.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:30.420 align:middle line:84%
It is finding new ways to
come out into your world.

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.460 align:middle line:84%
We believe that is
called the internet.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Indeed.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:37.070 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] That is true.

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.890 align:middle line:90%


00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:42.420 align:middle line:90%
Because now we--

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.710 align:middle line:84%
I have several things,
different types of topics,

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.480 align:middle line:84%
that it might seem like it's
non-sequential to kind of hop

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.280 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.330 align:middle line:84%
But this has to do
with Earth changes.

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:51.890 align:middle line:84%
People don't talk
about Earth changes

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:53.900 align:middle line:84%
quite as much as they
did even a decade ago.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:57.260 align:middle line:84%
It was dominating
the conversation

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.240 align:middle line:84%
for a long time--
fear of earthquakes

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.030 align:middle line:90%
and various things, tsunamis.

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And the beings that I have
spoken to in the past--

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:08.990 align:middle line:84%
once-- we were talking about
Edgar Cayce's predictions

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:11.210 align:middle line:84%
about the Earth and
the Earth changes.

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And they said, much of this
will, in time, come to pass.

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:18.140 align:middle line:84%
However, depending
on the consciousness

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.770 align:middle line:84%
of the people upon the land
in those areas, some of this

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:23.300 align:middle line:90%
will be averted.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And so can you
please share with us

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.430 align:middle line:84%
in a little bit of
depth what that means?

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:30.970 align:middle line:90%


00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: It depends on what
you need in order to remember

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:37.870 align:middle line:90%
the value of love.

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:40.210 align:middle line:90%
So we say to you--

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:41.290 align:middle line:90%
we hope you don't mind.

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.940 align:middle line:84%
We've just taken over
Belinda, and she's used to it.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:45.740 align:middle line:90%
So it's quite OK.

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: She's agreed to it.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: She's with us.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Your Mother Earth is one
of the 12 archangels.

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:55.270 align:middle line:90%
The number 12 is symbolic.

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:57.580 align:middle line:84%
It means evolution,
just like there

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:02.650 align:middle line:84%
are 12 signs in the zodiac
and 12 months in the year.

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Your Mother Earth is incredibly
engaged in your evolution.

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:11.140 align:middle line:90%
And she is passionate about it.

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And she is passionate
about helping humanity

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:19.720 align:middle line:84%
to let those old emotions
come up and out so that they

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.270 align:middle line:90%
can be heard and felt.

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:26.380 align:middle line:84%
We say as often as we have
the opportunity to say,

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.510 align:middle line:90%
do you want to heal your body?

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Then ask yourself,
what am I feeling?

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:33.670 align:middle line:90%
What am I feeling?

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And let it come up and out,
and your cells will heal.

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Your Earth is the same.

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:42.550 align:middle line:90%
She is a great Goddess.

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:47.260 align:middle line:84%
She is a great
archangel, arch meaning

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:52.190 align:middle line:84%
bridging Heaven and Earth,
bridging ego to soul.

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Her Earth changes
are nothing more

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:58.670 align:middle line:84%
than an external
mirror back to all

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:02.510 align:middle line:84%
of you, of your own
emotions that you

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:04.400 align:middle line:90%
have pushed underground.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So when she has a volcano,
when she has a tsunami

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:13.760 align:middle line:84%
and you want to help calm her
hurricanes, take a moment,

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:21.490 align:middle line:84%
and breathe in deeply, and
ask, what am I feeling?

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Are there any old feelings
that are far, far away

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:31.180 align:middle line:84%
from the divine mother
stuck within my cells,

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.430 align:middle line:90%
stuck within my subconscious?

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Do I have some self-loathing
in there, some shame?

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Do I have some
violence within me?

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Turn yourself into a dragon
in your creative imagination

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:52.220 align:middle line:90%
and release in a safe way.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Not only does that help
bring peace on Earth,

00:43:56.580 --> 00:44:01.960 align:middle line:90%
it helps to avert destruction.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:06.500 align:middle line:84%
She's merely trying to tell
you how you destroy yourselves

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.850 align:middle line:90%
by not feeling.

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And that is her job as one
of your major professors.

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so conversely,
where we are making progress,

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:21.950 align:middle line:84%
where we are able to understand
ourselves more as a sense

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:25.550 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual community-- and I
mean that in the deepest sense,

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:29.660 align:middle line:84%
where we are able to move
away from some of the denser

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.990 align:middle line:84%
frequencies,
vibrations into higher.

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Any events that may
have looked like they

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:42.975 align:middle line:84%
were going to manifest can be
calmed, soothed, not happen.

00:44:42.975 --> 00:44:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Absolutely.

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: Humanity, do you
realize how many times you

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:51.750 align:middle line:84%
would have blown up School
Room Earth with your nuclear

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:52.550 align:middle line:90%
weapons?

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:56.180 align:middle line:90%
Do you have any understanding?

00:44:56.180 --> 00:45:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And you have averted all of that
through your conscious ones,

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:02.850 align:middle line:90%
through your willing ones.

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And we want to differentiate
between consciousness

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:09.169 align:middle line:90%
and willingness.

00:45:09.169 --> 00:45:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Please explain this.

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:11.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: There are human
beings who have not read

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:20.630 align:middle line:84%
your Bible, who have not
studied the course in miracles,

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:24.350 align:middle line:84%
who do not know
who Edgar Cayce is.

00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:29.980 align:middle line:84%
But yet they are willing
to take responsibility

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:34.840 align:middle line:84%
for their own behavior,
for their own passions,

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.370 align:middle line:90%
for their own feelings.

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And even though they
have lives of hardship,

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:48.350 align:middle line:84%
they are willing to love and
to practice loving kindness.

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:54.440 align:middle line:84%
From our perspective, those
are the conscious ones.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.860 align:middle line:90%
And we are so grateful.

00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.225 align:middle line:90%
We are so grateful.

00:45:59.225 --> 00:46:02.790 align:middle line:90%


00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: On that note, one
of the questions I have is,

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.570 align:middle line:90%
we're very--

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:11.600 align:middle line:90%


00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.420 align:middle line:84%
on a lot of levels, where our
thought is central to wherever

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.640 align:middle line:90%
it is that we're located.

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.550 align:middle line:84%
But this is more of a
universal-- in this case,

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:21.260 align:middle line:90%
global-- discussion.

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know
from where you sit,

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:29.750 align:middle line:84%
where you view some of the
greatest rise in consciousness

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:33.980 align:middle line:84%
on the planet is happening in
places that might surprise us?

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Being in America, we always
think, oh, well, America first,

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:38.180 align:middle line:90%
but not necessarily.

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
wonderful place to be.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.830 align:middle line:84%
But I'm wondering if
there are-- where are you

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:45.410 align:middle line:84%
seeing pockets of
incredible growth

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:47.488 align:middle line:90%
on this level of willingness?

00:46:47.488 --> 00:46:50.180 align:middle line:90%


00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: The
angels say, Regina,

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:56.800 align:middle line:84%
you know the answer
to this question.

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.560 align:middle line:84%
It is happening
all over the world,

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:05.980 align:middle line:84%
in all walks of life because
the ancient ones have returned.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's my
follow-up question.

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.366 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] So if you'd
please, go ahead with that

00:47:10.366 --> 00:47:11.990 align:middle line:84%
because again, we
meet people, and it's

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:13.850 align:middle line:90%
such ancient family now.

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:15.720 align:middle line:90%
Round and round we go.

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And so many from even
the times of Atlantis

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.720 align:middle line:84%
that seem to be coming
back together with some

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:23.270 align:middle line:90%
recall again, which has memory.

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:26.450 align:middle line:84%
It even has technology--
spiritual technology.

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about what
is awaiting us once we

00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:32.760 align:middle line:90%
awaken to that in ourselves?

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: So in the beginning,
when the Creator dreamed

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:43.540 align:middle line:84%
herself into being,
himself into being--

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:49.040 align:middle line:84%
because the Creator is beyond a
him and her or a her and him--

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:56.500 align:middle line:84%
there were 12 great souls
birthed from the central soul.

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:59.740 align:middle line:90%
Our names are the 12 archangels.

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:04.550 align:middle line:84%
From those 12, remember
we speak in metaphor.

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: There were ancient
ones birthed at the same time.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was their
prayer to create

00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:22.040 align:middle line:84%
a school unique in
all of the expanding

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:27.520 align:middle line:84%
consciousness and creation of
the Creator of Mother-Father

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.700 align:middle line:90%
God.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Those ancient ones
created your school.

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:37.710 align:middle line:84%
They are Lemurian
in their roots.

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:40.890 align:middle line:84%
They are Atlantean, and
they are, of course,

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:43.080 align:middle line:90%
from this time of Tara.

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And they have returned
in full force.

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Your ascended masters that you
speak of throughout the ages,

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.530 align:middle line:90%
they are here.

00:48:54.530 --> 00:49:00.590 align:middle line:84%
The ancient kings and
queens, they are here.

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:06.430 align:middle line:84%
The high priestesses and
priests that their role was

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:12.730 align:middle line:84%
to hold the consciousness of
the Creator of the highest truth

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:18.320 align:middle line:84%
that only love
exists, they are here.

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Everywhere,
all around the planet.

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:22.200 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: The angels are here.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: We are all here.

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So of course, humanity will be
successful in this graduation.

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And along
that line, again,

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:43.970 align:middle line:84%
dipping back into antiquity and
some of these original ancient

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:49.160 align:middle line:84%
beings, is Atlantis going to
be rising back to the surface

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.600 align:middle line:90%
again?

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: From our perspective,
the fall of Atlantis

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and the fall of Lemuria,
it was illusion,

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:05.360 align:middle line:84%
just like you describe the
arts, and music, and education,

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and that it appears right now
that all of those are less

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:16.260 align:middle line:84%
important than bank accounts,
and politics, and big business.

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:21.440 align:middle line:84%
We say to you that the
beautiful era of Lemuria,

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:26.360 align:middle line:84%
the time of the divine feminine
and feeling, and the time

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:31.100 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis, and the
power of your thoughts,

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and of the divine masculine,
they just moved behind a veil.

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:41.980 align:middle line:90%
So the veil is lifting.

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:45.670 align:middle line:84%
The veil is lifting, just
as the veil is lifting

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:47.230 align:middle line:90%
between Heaven and Earth.

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:51.850 align:middle line:84%
So you will also see
that so many human beings

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:54.610 align:middle line:90%
see their loved ones.

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:58.270 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't that long
ago that that was

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:00.010 align:middle line:90%
something to be frightened of.

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:01.567 align:middle line:90%
But now, it is very popular.

00:51:01.567 --> 00:51:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Becoming very common.

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.232 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Absolutely.

00:51:04.232 --> 00:51:05.440 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is psychic.

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.270 align:middle line:90%
How wonderful.

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And will the veil
ultimately be lifted from

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:16.420 align:middle line:84%
our own understanding of
self, in that this perpetual

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:21.040 align:middle line:84%
reincarnation into a
forgetfulness and having

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:25.060 align:middle line:84%
to experience life in that way,
almost starting anew except

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:27.430 align:middle line:84%
for what's in the
aura or subconscious--

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:30.400 align:middle line:84%
well, are we entering or
drawing near to a time

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:34.720 align:middle line:84%
when we can begin remembering
upon reincarnation?

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Yes.

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:39.810 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful yes.

00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:41.670 align:middle line:90%
And how wonderful.

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In the past, was it
felt that because of our maybe

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:50.970 align:middle line:84%
child-likeness that the pain of
the past was too much to bring

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:54.540 align:middle line:84%
through into each incarnation,
the remembrance of the pain?

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Is it that now we'll be
able to see it in a new way,

00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:00.000 align:middle line:84%
in a more integrated
way, and thus we

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.090 align:middle line:84%
can have those remembrances
made available?

00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: It's all
about perspective.

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Human beings do not like pain,
and they don't like change.

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:12.570 align:middle line:84%
So if they can avoid
looking at what hurts,

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:16.380 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in the past or the
present, they we'll do that.

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:17.250 align:middle line:90%
So

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:20.790 align:middle line:84%
The job of the angels and
of spiritual messengers

00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:25.360 align:middle line:84%
all over the globe, the ancient
ones, is to let them know.

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Here.

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Let us show you how to look
so that it doesn't hurt,

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.970 align:middle line:84%
so that transformation
actually feels like joy.

00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:34.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a lifting up.

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:35.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a liberation.

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:38.490 align:middle line:84%
It's the freedom
you cry out for.

00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:39.750 align:middle line:90%
And it is happening.

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it seems like
we'll be able to learn so much

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:48.290 align:middle line:84%
more quickly, if we start off
with a little bit of knowledge

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:49.640 align:middle line:90%
of our past.

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, history does
repeat itself, it seems.

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: History-- it's
the way that you work, right?

00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Of course, history
repeats itself

00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:05.240 align:middle line:84%
because the subconscious is
made of thoughts and feelings.

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.810 align:middle line:84%
It is the past, and you're
using your subconscious

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:10.670 align:middle line:90%
to create your present.

00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:15.350 align:middle line:84%
So there is an exciting
movement on your planet.

00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And that is, let
go of your past.

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:19.970 align:middle line:90%
Learn from it, and let it go.

00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:23.240 align:middle line:84%
We believe that that was
even in "The Lion King."

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:25.650 align:middle line:84%
We do love that
movie here in Heaven.

00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
a wonderful movie.

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: Let your past
go, but learn from it.

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is happening through
the joy of transformation.

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And again, there are healers
all over the planet--

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:44.150 align:middle line:84%
great shamans, whether they know
that they are a shaman or not,

00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:46.490 align:middle line:84%
which just means
teacher of change.

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:52.610 align:middle line:84%
They are helping to facilitate
the letting go of the past.

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:54.980 align:middle line:90%
Let's let it go and forgive it.

00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wonderful.

00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:59.361 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have only
a few minutes left,

00:53:59.361 --> 00:54:01.610 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to go through
a couple of things quickly,

00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:03.320 align:middle line:90%
and one I'm curious about.

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.660 align:middle line:84%
It's often been said
that what was laid down

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.250 align:middle line:84%
in the higher times
of Egypt, which

00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:09.500 align:middle line:84%
is far more ancient
than our history books

00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:14.510 align:middle line:84%
relay, that much was laid down
via hieroglyphics and such

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:17.090 align:middle line:84%
from the Atlantean
and Lemurian times,

00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and that those hieroglyphics
will actually tell us

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.990 align:middle line:84%
what we have to look forward
to live into once again,

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:26.720 align:middle line:84%
if we could only
understand them correctly.

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Is any headway really being
made in understanding,

00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:33.200 align:middle line:84%
truly understanding, the
hieroglyphics, the meaning

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.450 align:middle line:90%
of these hieroglyphics?

00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: We offer
you a simpler way.

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Hieroglyphics are marvelous
because they actually were

00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:46.490 align:middle line:90%
encoded here on your school.

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:49.460 align:middle line:84%
What we say to you,
just close your eyes

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:55.040 align:middle line:84%
and take a deep
breath, and say inside,

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:58.246 align:middle line:84%
I would like to know what's
in those hieroglyphics.

00:54:58.246 --> 00:54:59.046 align:middle line:90%

It's not just in the
ancient hieroglyphics.

It is in other texts and
hidden beautiful sacred spots

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:18.500 align:middle line:90%
on your planet.

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:21.260 align:middle line:84%

of her school in all of the 300
billion layers of her being.

00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:29.660 align:middle line:90%
It is there.

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:32.120 align:middle line:90%

If we could hold one
single belief that

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:51.530 align:middle line:84%
is universal within us and
embody that particular belief,

00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:56.354 align:middle line:84%
what would the most significant
one for humanity be?
