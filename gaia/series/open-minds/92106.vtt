>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Throughout recorded history,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.659 align:middle line:10%
texts of all faiths have told
of a time of great floods.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:10%
One of the most
well-known stories

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.630 align:middle line:10%
comes from the Old Testament,
of Noah and his great ark.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Stories passed down
through the ages

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.360 align:middle line:84%
in the vicinity of
and on Mount Ararat

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.630 align:middle line:84%
have told of the
location of Noah's ark.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Now technology is
assisting in the validation

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.500 align:middle line:90%
of these stories.

Maverick archaeologist
Aaron Judkins

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.940 align:middle line:84%
went on an intrepid
expedition up Mount Ararat

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:84%
with a crew of
scientists and filmmakers

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.510 align:middle line:90%
in search for the ark.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.690 align:middle line:84%
The film is titled
"Finding Noah."

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.220 align:middle line:84%
He's here with us today to
talk about the experience,

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.580 align:middle line:84%
the methods, and what
they believe they found.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Before we meet Aaron,
however, let's take a look

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.067 align:middle line:84%

-There's been 32
different reports

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.874 align:middle line:84%
that I've got of a structure
being seen on that mountain,

00:02:08.874 --> 00:02:11.266 align:middle line:90%
no place else.

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:14.740 align:middle line:84%
-If it's there, then
people in the world

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.147 align:middle line:90%
ought to know about it.

00:02:16.147 --> 00:02:17.730 align:middle line:84%
-Do I believe there's
something there?

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.270 align:middle line:90%
What it is, don't know.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.396 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.396 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:84%
If you do see this boat
sticking out of the ancient ice,

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.046 align:middle line:90%
it could change everything.

00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:35.370 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.840 align:middle line:84%
-We saw some
interesting anomalies.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.730 align:middle line:84%
An anomaly is
something that's not

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.625 align:middle line:90%
normal to the ice formation.

-We're gonna climb
that mountain.

00:02:57.228 --> 00:02:59.125 align:middle line:84%
-This would be the
biggest discovery

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:01.880 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the world.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.260 align:middle line:84%
-That mountain is
a lurking beast

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.140 align:middle line:84%
that will just consume you if
you make one small mistake.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well done.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.860 align:middle line:90%
This was a good film crew.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:84%
They did a great job
on this, it looks like,

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.440 align:middle line:90%
from what I've seen so far.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.356 align:middle line:90%
>>AARON JUDKINS: Yeah.

00:03:57.356 --> 00:03:58.960 align:middle line:90%
They really did.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.580 align:middle line:10%
We had some great
people on the team.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:11.320 align:middle line:10%
And the film crew, this was a
crew hired for their expertise

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.214 align:middle line:10%
in climbing to a
height of 17,000 feet.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's crazy.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: So these guys
knew what they were doing.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's
directed by Brent Baum

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.820 align:middle line:90%
and produced as well.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And then our producer,
Matthew Marsden,

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.466 align:middle line:84%
who you might know from "Black
Hawk Down" and "Transformers."

00:04:31.466 --> 00:04:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:84%
No, this is very
compelling, very well done,

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.830 align:middle line:90%
beautiful cinematography.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.880 align:middle line:84%
But before we go into
any of that, let's

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:84%
set the stage for
the actual location,

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.750 align:middle line:84%
the geopolitical environment,
the environment itself

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.160 align:middle line:84%
of Mount Ararat so people can
have an understanding of what

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.030 align:middle line:90%
you were up against.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.940 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just a little trek
up a little mountain here.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: No.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.660 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.350 align:middle line:84%
I get asked that
quite often, actually.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Why can't you just go
up there and find it?

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.170 align:middle line:10%
And of course, over
the years, and I'm

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:08.440 align:middle line:10%
talking hundreds of years,
we have credible reports

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.920 align:middle line:10%
of people seeing something
on that mountain, Mount

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.010 align:middle line:10%
Ararat in eastern Turkey.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:10%
But it's not as simple as going
up and climbing up to the top

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.370 align:middle line:10%
and just looking.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more
involved with it.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:84%
It's quite an adventure to
try to get up there and get

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
everything that you
need to do the job.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Just to get yourself
up there it's quite--

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.705 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 17,000 feet.

00:05:33.705 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: It's hard.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.170 align:middle line:90%
People get sick at that.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about what you
stumble across along the way,

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.854 align:middle line:84%
and just even getting up there,
getting passage up there.

00:05:41.854 --> 00:05:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: Yeah.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, just getting
on that mountain requires

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.290 align:middle line:84%
a lot of red tape with
the government of Turkey.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And we've had tremendous
success in them allowing us

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.050 align:middle line:84%
permission to go
up on the mountain.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.650 align:middle line:84%
With that, it takes
a lot of paperwork,

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.050 align:middle line:84%
a lot of time to get
those permissions.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.060 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, we
have had the permission

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.800 align:middle line:84%
for the last three to four
years and the only permissions

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.722 align:middle line:84%
to excavate and search for
Noah's ark on that mountain.

00:06:19.722 --> 00:06:21.055 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's pretty amazing.

00:06:21.055 --> 00:06:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: It's pretty amazing.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why we're not
hearing about it elsewhere is

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.560 align:middle line:84%
because no one else has been
granted permission except

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.920 align:middle line:90%
this--

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: Not officially.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:90%
Not officially.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.250 align:middle line:84%
We've been granted that
official, exclusive access

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.970 align:middle line:90%
on the mountain to search.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Now having said that, just
getting access is a real issue.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.100 align:middle line:84%
But even if you get access,
there are so many factors

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:50.680 align:middle line:84%
around that area geopolitically,
weather-wise, crevasses,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.781 align:middle line:84%
boulders, falling rocks,
the PKK, which is the--

00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:54.406 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:54.406 --> 00:06:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
politics for a little bit.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: The politics.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Historically the politics
has been very, very difficult

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.390 align:middle line:90%
around that area.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:84%
The PKK, which is the
Kurdish workers freedom

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
fighters for Kurdistan,
they've been at odds

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.610 align:middle line:90%
with the Turkish military.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And they've controlled that
mountain, and they still do.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And so they know who's on
that mountain at all times.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's been very
difficult in the years past

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.330 align:middle line:90%
to get on that mountain.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.480 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, other teams
have been captured by the PKK

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.290 align:middle line:90%
at gunpoint.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.830 align:middle line:90%
They've been held hostage.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And about three to four
years ago, back in 2010,

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.930 align:middle line:84%
one of the local guides
who was with our team--

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:47.560 align:middle line:84%
our team was captured, removed
off the mountain at gunpoint.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And they let every
one of our team

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.540 align:middle line:84%
go except for one
of the local guys.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And they executed
him as a statement.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And they burned the
trucks and the tractors

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.550 align:middle line:84%
that they were making for
a road up through there

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.920 align:middle line:84%
at one of the-- down towards
the lower part of the mountain.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very serious matter
when you go on that mountain.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.710 align:middle line:84%
You put your life at
risk-- a calculated risk,

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.430 align:middle line:90%
but it is a risk.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And because of
that, you're always

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.410 align:middle line:90%
aware of your surroundings.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:20.820 align:middle line:90%
You have to be.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.700 align:middle line:84%
When you go on
that mountain, you

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.260 align:middle line:84%
go into automatic
survival mode, you know.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.150 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be aware of
who's around you at all times.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Now having said that, the
year that we were there,

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.730 align:middle line:84%
2013, just about
a year ago, there

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.130 align:middle line:84%
was a truce between the PKK
and the Turkish military.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.799 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, so you really
slotted in at a unique time.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:42.757 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: And it held.

00:08:42.757 --> 00:08:43.970 align:middle line:90%
That truce held.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.317 align:middle line:84%
There was no active
fighting on the mountain.

00:08:47.317 --> 00:08:48.650 align:middle line:90%
We had the necessary permission.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:53.440 align:middle line:84%
We went up and we were
granted full access.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And we, I guess, were able
to do our work unimpeded.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.110 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's--

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.441 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it borders
Syria, Iran, Russia.

00:09:03.441 --> 00:09:03.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: It does.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And geopolitically, it has been
really a hard area to search.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.560 align:middle line:84%
People say, well, why
can't you just take

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.830 align:middle line:90%
an airplane or a helicopter?

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.860 align:middle line:84%
There have been searchers
in the past that

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.690 align:middle line:90%
utilizes those aircraft.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.710 align:middle line:84%
But historically, if you
don't have the permission

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and they don't
know you're there,

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:middle line:84%
they shoot first and
ask questions later.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's very difficult if
you have the permission.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.880 align:middle line:84%
The winds are so very high
that it's very difficult

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.270 align:middle line:90%
to really search by aircraft.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Crazy weather.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: And crazy weather.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.221 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you
guys know-- did you

00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:44.780 align:middle line:84%
decide to go because a truce had
been called or were you just--

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.630 align:middle line:84%
did the timing just
work out that way?

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: The timing
worked out that way.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.830 align:middle line:84%
The leader of the expedition
is Richard Bright.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, Richard has been
searching on that mountain

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.970 align:middle line:90%
a good part of 30 years.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And he's climbed that
mountain an average of once

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.930 align:middle line:90%
a year, so about 30 times.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And he's spent a majority of
his life building relationships

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:07.750 align:middle line:90%
with the--

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:08.791 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With the Kurds.

00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: --local people
around that mountain.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And because of those
established relationships,

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.080 align:middle line:84%
we've had quite a few
doors open up for us

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:84%
and those permissions
obtained where

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.110 align:middle line:90%
we can go and do these things.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.280 align:middle line:84%
They just happened to fall
during the truce, which

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.800 align:middle line:84%
worked out well,
because this was

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.502 align:middle line:84%
the last major scientific
search for the ark.

00:10:31.502 --> 00:10:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And you just slotted
in at the perfect hour.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: We did.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.613 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:10:36.613 --> 00:10:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Well it's not just
the freedom fighters

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.735 align:middle line:90%
and the political tensions.

00:10:40.735 --> 00:10:42.610 align:middle line:84%
There are other challenges
about the mountain

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:47.210 align:middle line:84%
itself, some of the wild
dogs that are there.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about that
and also what kind of weather

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.210 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Well, you know,
environmentally, the weather,

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.550 align:middle line:90%
it's clear most mornings.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't see the summit
for the first three or four

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.390 align:middle line:84%
days I arrived in eastern Turkey
because it was clouded in.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.595 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw the
summit, the sun came out,

00:11:09.595 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:84%
it was clear, beautiful
day, and I saw the summit

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.800 align:middle line:84%
for the first time, my heart
sank because I realized,

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.332 align:middle line:84%
I'm fixing to have
to climb that thing.

00:11:18.332 --> 00:11:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't
know what was ahead.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: I saw
how high it was.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:22.861 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: I had trained.

00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully I had some wisdom
three months before to train.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:32.220 align:middle line:90%
And I don't like to train.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.570 align:middle line:84%
But I hired a
personal trainer just

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.352 align:middle line:84%
to kick me along and
say, OK, 7 o'clock,

00:11:38.352 --> 00:11:39.560 align:middle line:90%
we've got to meet at the gym.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was so thankful that I
had done that, a lot of cardio,

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:49.140 align:middle line:84%
a lot of leg strength, and a lot
of breathing so when you get up

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
to those altitudes you don't
get high altitude sickness.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And so it took a lot of
perseverance for me to do that.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.360 align:middle line:84%
But I was very thankful,
because when I saw that summit,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.080 align:middle line:90%
I realized this is it.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.139 align:middle line:90%
I'm really here.

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like seeing the
pyramids for the first time.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.230 align:middle line:84%
You see it in the
pictures and TV.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:08.900 align:middle line:84%
But when I stood next
to the pyramid at Giza

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:84%
and looked at it and looked up
at it for the very first time,

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:13.960 align:middle line:90%
it's a different story.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.514 align:middle line:90%
You realize how small you are.

00:12:15.514 --> 00:12:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same feeling I
got when I saw Mount Ararat.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well now,
the crew is what,

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.042 align:middle line:84%
23, 4, 5, something
like 25 people?

00:12:22.042 --> 00:12:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Well,
altogether we had,

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.380 align:middle line:84%
you know, a lot of the
film crew was there.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:29.430 align:middle line:84%
We had people coming in
and out of the dig crew.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And so we had a lot of
people at any given time

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:32.980 align:middle line:90%
coming in and out.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But had
they taken the time

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.770 align:middle line:84%
to go through training
beforehand, most of them?

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: A lot of
them had climbed before.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:41.950 align:middle line:84%
The film crew had climbed
on other expeditions,

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.810 align:middle line:90%
filming other things.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
hired because we

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.510 align:middle line:84%
knew they could get
up the mountain.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them have
had experience doing that.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.960 align:middle line:84%
The dig crew had climbed
Mount Ararat, most of them,

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.430 align:middle line:90%
in the seasons past.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:02.220 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to
go up the mountain.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.580 align:middle line:90%
They knew what they were doing.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's that first
time, that unknown, you

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.300 align:middle line:90%
know, what am I getting into?

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And after you do it the first
time, they asked me how I did.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell
you the truth.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.130 align:middle line:84%
It was the hardest
thing I've ever done.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
hard to think straight

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.775 align:middle line:90%
under those conditions, too.

00:13:21.775 --> 00:13:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: It can be.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:23.275 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:23.275 --> 00:13:26.627 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: I have to
tell you a funny story.

00:13:26.627 --> 00:13:28.960 align:middle line:84%
I almost-- before I tell you
that, let me tell you this.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.570 align:middle line:90%
I almost gave up.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And you get to a point where
it ceases to become physical

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.560 align:middle line:90%
and it becomes mental.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And I reached that
point-- we got up

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:42.680 align:middle line:84%
about 1:00 AM, started for
the summit about 3:00 AM.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.530 align:middle line:90%
And you're packed with gear.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.890 align:middle line:90%
And you're climbing in the dark.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And from 14,000 feet, which is
the high camp to the summit,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.780 align:middle line:90%
it's steep.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's a hard climb.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:55.740 align:middle line:84%
You're going through
the boulder field.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And so we're talking about
environmental factors.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's dangerous, too.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: It's dangerous.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.920 align:middle line:84%
You get socked in
by the weather.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And the weather can
change on a dime.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.750 align:middle line:84%
But the big boulders, you've
got to go through that boulder

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:08.250 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And it just feels
like it's endless.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So at about somewhere between
15,000 and 16,000 feet,

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.330 align:middle line:90%
I stopped.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:19.220 align:middle line:84%
I was-- Everything in my body
was screaming to give up.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.784 align:middle line:84%
Aaron, turn around,
go back down,

00:14:20.784 --> 00:14:24.510 align:middle line:84%
it's easier-- because I
was really feeling it.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.405 align:middle line:90%
And I had stopped to rest.

00:14:26.405 --> 00:14:28.530 align:middle line:84%
You don't stop to
rest very long.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.870 align:middle line:84%
You do just to get a little
water and then to go on.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.710 align:middle line:84%
You don't want your
legs to get cold.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.050 align:middle line:90%
You've got to stay going.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:38.768 align:middle line:84%
And you don't climb
that mountain,

00:14:38.768 --> 00:14:42.410 align:middle line:90%
you do it in baby steps.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.664 align:middle line:84%
But having said that, I
stopped because I considered,

00:14:45.664 --> 00:14:47.330 align:middle line:84%
I just don't think
I'm going to make it.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.454 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that I'm going
to get myself up there.

00:14:49.454 --> 00:14:51.320 align:middle line:90%
It was so difficult.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And about 6:00 in
the morning, the sun

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.670 align:middle line:84%
came up over Greater Ararat,
and it casted a shadow

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:57.740 align:middle line:90%
on the valley floor.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that shadow of the
mountain on that valley floor--

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.240 align:middle line:84%
it's probably five
miles on that valley.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at that
and I thought, wow,

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.310 align:middle line:90%
how beautiful is that?

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm on Mount Ararat
in eastern Turkey

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:14.610 align:middle line:84%
looking at the shadow of--
and I'm on this mountain,

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and I've just got a
little ways to go.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And you come to a point where
you have to dig down deep.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:90%
It's like Bear Grylls.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.800 align:middle line:84%
He says people are
made of grapes.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.310 align:middle line:84%
You really don't know what
you're made out of, though,

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:29.584 align:middle line:90%
until you're squeezed.

00:15:29.584 --> 00:15:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Some people
are sour grapes.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.389 align:middle line:90%
Some people are fine wine.

00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:84%
But you really don't
know what you're

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.917 align:middle line:84%
made out of until
you're squeezed.

00:15:36.917 --> 00:15:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And theoretically,
each one of you

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.280 align:middle line:90%
had to go through this process.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: Everyone.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.864 align:middle line:84%
And every time you go
back on that mountain,

00:15:43.864 --> 00:15:45.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure those guys
who'd climbed before

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:48.260 align:middle line:90%
had to go through it again.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.640 align:middle line:84%
But that's the point
that I reached.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to give up or
am I going to keep going?

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And for that period of time,
even though it was brief,

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.730 align:middle line:90%
I had thought about giving up.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
Aaron, if I give up,

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.810 align:middle line:84%
I'll regret it for
the rest of my life.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.575 align:middle line:84%
How can I go back home and
tell my 11-year-old son

00:16:06.575 --> 00:16:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Tannon-- how can I
tell him Daddy gave up,

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.450 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't make it?

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:14.235 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'm going to do
this no matter what it takes.

00:16:14.235 --> 00:16:18.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to dig down
deep and really reach down deep

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:19.030 align:middle line:90%
and go.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I did, just
one step in front of the other.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you get on top,
you're almost at 17,000 feet.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.000 align:middle line:90%
The weather was bad.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.190 align:middle line:84%
When you get on the ice,
you put on your ice gear,

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:32.164 align:middle line:84%
and you go for the summit,
the weather was terrible.

00:16:32.164 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:90%
It was terrible.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.450 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh my
gosh, this is so bad.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:90%
The visibility was low.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.620 align:middle line:90%
The wind was blowing sideways.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.180 align:middle line:90%
And it is miserable.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.447 align:middle line:90%
I get up to the summit.

00:16:41.447 --> 00:16:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what
do you want to do?

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.207 align:middle line:90%
You want to take a picture.

00:16:44.207 --> 00:16:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: So I'm from Texas.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.270 align:middle line:84%
I take out my Texas flag I
had packed in my backpack.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.700 align:middle line:90%
I thought, man, this is great.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.240 align:middle line:84%
The weather's bad, but I'm
going to get a picture.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:84%
So I proudly fly the flag, the
Texas flag, get my picture.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you're
not posing very long.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.710 align:middle line:84%
It's so cold up there,
you're getting your picture

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:06.050 align:middle line:84%
and we're moving
on to the campsite.

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:09.030 align:middle line:84%
On the way back, the
weather was great.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.470 align:middle line:90%
And it was beautiful.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:11.640 align:middle line:90%
The sun was out.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.619 align:middle line:90%
It was clear.

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:15.791 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what another
opportunity to get a picture

00:17:15.791 --> 00:17:18.040 align:middle line:84%
at the summit, because the
first one I'm sure was bad.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have time to
look at my pictures.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.319 align:middle line:84%
So again I take
the Texas flag out.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.740 align:middle line:90%
I fly it proudly.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.339 align:middle line:90%
And we get a few pictures.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:27.099 align:middle line:90%
I go back down.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And about a week later,
I'm going through my photos

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and I realize something's not
right with this photo of me

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:34.990 align:middle line:90%
on the summit.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, Aaron,
something is not right.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that the
Texas flag is upside down.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Not only once.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You probably
couldn't even see the flag.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Not only
once, but twice.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:45.822 align:middle line:90%
I did it twice.

00:17:45.822 --> 00:17:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking
how can I do this?

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm representing my state and
I get the flag upside down.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm sure they're
still proud of you.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: So anyway, but
that's part of the hypoxia.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: And of course,
I blame it on hypoxia.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.490 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't look at the flag.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:03.595 align:middle line:84%
But you do get in those spots
where you do have hypoxia.

00:18:03.595 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Hard to focus.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: And it's
hard to breathe.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to walk.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.979 align:middle line:84%
And it does affect
your thinking at times.

00:18:09.979 --> 00:18:10.604 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:10.604 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Your mental acuity.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:11.750 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: So until you
acclimate to that environment--

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:17.849 align:middle line:90%
Now what about these wild dogs?

00:18:17.849 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:90%
What's up with wild dogs?

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Well, there are
some wild dogs on the mountain.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.935 align:middle line:84%
We didn't run into
really any wild dogs.

00:18:25.935 --> 00:18:29.230 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.780 align:middle line:84%
There are those dangers
there where those dogs,

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.790 align:middle line:90%
they roam in packs.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.644 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't really
run into any of that.

00:18:35.644 --> 00:18:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's good.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.226 align:middle line:84%
I just read about them and I
thought, what's up with them?

00:18:39.226 --> 00:18:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Well,
but they're there.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.435 align:middle line:84%
And the main thing
that really affect you

00:18:44.435 --> 00:18:47.770 align:middle line:84%
is those big boulders, because
when you're at the 14,000 feet

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:51.860 align:middle line:84%
camp, you just pick the softest
rock to pitch your tent,

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.120 align:middle line:90%
because it's all rock.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.770 align:middle line:90%
And they're huge boulders.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:57.435 align:middle line:84%
And during the night, you can
hear the boulders falling--

00:18:57.435 --> 00:18:57.585 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, god.

00:18:57.585 --> 00:18:57.950 align:middle line:90%
How could you sleep?

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.658 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: --and
whizzing past your tent.

00:18:59.658 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And off in the distance, you can
hear the boulders falling down

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:03.840 align:middle line:90%
the gorge.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little
unnerving at times.

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:06.215 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:06.215 --> 00:19:07.467 align:middle line:90%
A little, you think?

00:19:07.467 --> 00:19:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: And you're
camped on a slope like this,

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:15.430 align:middle line:84%
so it's not very comfortable
when you get up that high.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's why we
called you intrepid explorers.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.420 align:middle line:84%
This is not for
the faint-hearted.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.594 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: It's really not.

00:19:20.594 --> 00:19:21.260 align:middle line:90%
It's really not.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Amazing that you followed
through, that any of you

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:24.608 align:middle line:90%
followed through on it.

00:19:24.608 --> 00:19:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Now let's get to some
of the local lore,

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.670 align:middle line:84%
because this is in support
of what you were doing.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.660 align:middle line:84%
The local lore among
the native people

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.760 align:middle line:84%
there about an ark, a
flood, Ararat in general.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.834 align:middle line:90%
What is some of the native lore?

00:19:38.834 --> 00:19:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Well,
it's interesting.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Around that area
of eastern Turkey,

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.900 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of towns named
after the Biblical names

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.100 align:middle line:90%
of the Genesis account.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.330 align:middle line:84%
So you have the names
of Noah and his sons.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And even Ararat means
the region of eight.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And we know eight
people were on the ark.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting that it's
really embedded in the culture.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Turkish
government really

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.722 align:middle line:84%
doesn't care either way
about finding the ark.

00:20:06.722 --> 00:20:07.680 align:middle line:90%
I find it a little odd.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.310 align:middle line:84%
The Kurdish people,
however, that

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:15.620 align:middle line:84%
live around the mountain
have grown up fully embedded

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.660 align:middle line:84%
in that story and
in their culture.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And so they're very accustomed
to hearing about the ark

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.340 align:middle line:90%
because they live it.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.680 align:middle line:90%
They live there.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And so for them, it's
just second nature.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.960 align:middle line:90%
Toward the north is Armenia.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, we actually
went into Armenia

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.520 align:middle line:84%
to do some research
with the film.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.139 align:middle line:84%
And the Armenian people really
embrace the story of the ark.

00:20:38.139 --> 00:20:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't there a higher
percentage of Christians

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:41.587 align:middle line:90%
in Armenia versus--

00:20:41.587 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: There is.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.120 align:middle line:90%
The bulk of the region.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Armenia
has been traditionally

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.670 align:middle line:90%
a Christian nation.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And they really embrace
that story of Noahs' ark.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:56.295 align:middle line:84%
So there's a really-- there's
a contrast between the two.

00:20:56.295 --> 00:20:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, sure.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:59.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the predominant
religion doesn't

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.380 align:middle line:84%
support that story in Turkey,
so that does make sense.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: And even in other
religions, it is recognized.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.290 align:middle line:84%
In the Muslim
religion, in Islam,

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.590 align:middle line:84%
it's recognized, of
Noah and his ark.

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:15.794 align:middle line:90%


00:21:15.794 --> 00:21:18.127 align:middle line:84%
In the Jewish faith,
in the Christian faith,

00:21:18.127 --> 00:21:19.085 align:middle line:90%
they're all recognized.

00:21:19.085 --> 00:21:24.250 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
it is pretty unique

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:84%
that most of every culture
around the world, some 500

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.710 align:middle line:84%
ubiquitous flood legends
around the world.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: So everyone has their
own Noah and their own boat.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a common
thread that runs

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.300 align:middle line:90%
through all those cultures.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:43.580 align:middle line:84%
I was in Peru back in January,
in Bolivia researching.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:90%
And it was very interesting.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Peru has a very rich culture.

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Macchu Pichu is so
wonderful, by the way.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.030 align:middle line:90%
It's really a lost world.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.850 align:middle line:84%
It was lost to time
some 500 years.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:58.397 align:middle line:84%
And it is such a
wonderful place to visit.

00:21:58.397 --> 00:22:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they have their
own flood legends, as well.

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:01.813 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: They really do.

00:22:01.813 --> 00:22:04.110 align:middle line:84%
The Native Americans here
in the United States.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:84%
So you have all these
different flood legends

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.280 align:middle line:90%
with a common thread.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that in the
Chinese language, embedded

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:16.210 align:middle line:84%
in their language, the word
for "large ship"-- now,

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.740 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese language is
kind of pictographical.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And the word for "large ship" is
eight plus persons plus a boat.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: And they still
use that for "large ship."

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:28.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Isn't
that interesting?

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:30.425 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:22:30.425 --> 00:22:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: And their
name for Noah in Chinese

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:38.680 align:middle line:84%
means "the man from whom
the weed curse is removed."

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The wheat?

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:40.403 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: The weed.

00:22:40.403 --> 00:22:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Weed curse.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: The man through
whom the weed curse is removed.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.565 align:middle line:84%
That goes back to
the story of Genesis.

00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: This is
actually embedded

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.890 align:middle line:90%
in the Chinese language.

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So we see throughout
these cultures

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:90%
that everyone has a flood story.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And we really wanted
to focus in on not only

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.040 align:middle line:84%
those historical
accounts by Marco Polo

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.410 align:middle line:84%
and by Josephus and people
who have gone through history

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:11.980 align:middle line:84%
and have written records
and accounts about seeing

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.590 align:middle line:84%
a structure on that
mountain, but more recent

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:21.820 align:middle line:84%
accounts from 1906, 1904
from George Hagopian.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.430 align:middle line:10%
He said when he was about
10, him and his uncle

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.980 align:middle line:10%
went up to the site twice.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And he gives an account
of seeing in the ark.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:34.860 align:middle line:10%
Again in 1943, Ed Davis,
who was stationed over

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:39.510 align:middle line:10%
in Iran during World War
II, he was doing some work.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.550 align:middle line:10%
And they were actually
making a road from there

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:48.510 align:middle line:10%
into-- from Turkey into Russia.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And one of the local
villages didn't have water.

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:54.800 align:middle line:84%
They had to walk about
two miles to go get water.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And so Ed Davis, being an
engineer, took some dynamite.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Dynamite fixes everything.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And he went and
blasted this area

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.190 align:middle line:84%
so water could flow
to the village.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:09.990 align:middle line:10%
Well, this family, Abas, who
was the leader of the village

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:13.200 align:middle line:10%
said in return-- because you
saved our village, really,

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.610 align:middle line:10%
and in return, as
a favor, we want

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:18.230 align:middle line:10%
to be able to take you
to see the holy ark.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.164 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is what they
call it, the holy ark.

00:24:20.164 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: So Abas sent
his grandsons up to see

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:25.500 align:middle line:90%
if the ark was visible.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Several days later
they came back

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:28.094 align:middle line:90%
and they said it's visible.

00:24:28.094 --> 00:24:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And they said, if you can
get permission to leave,

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.200 align:middle line:84%
we want to take you to see
the ark as a way to honor you.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.170 align:middle line:90%
And he got permission.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And it took him
three to four days

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.380 align:middle line:84%
to climb up to
where that site was.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And they were about
100 feet over it.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:48.157 align:middle line:84%
And he said they looked
down and he saw it

00:24:48.157 --> 00:24:51.160 align:middle line:90%
in two levels, two structures.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.530 align:middle line:90%
He said it had broken in two.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.904 align:middle line:84%
And he gave this
account of what he saw.

00:24:56.904 --> 00:24:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said it was--
one was on a ledge.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:90%
One was over here.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.370 align:middle line:90%
He could see three levels.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:04.730 align:middle line:84%
He could see kind of
windows on the top.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.474 align:middle line:84%
And he said it was
a barge-like shape.

00:25:07.474 --> 00:25:09.640 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, how do you
know it was the ark, Ed?

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, well there wasn't a
sign saying it was Noah's ark.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:14.920 align:middle line:90%
He said, what else could it be?

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: And they were going
to go the next morning to try

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.640 align:middle line:84%
to reach down to the ark,
but it started raining.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.831 align:middle line:90%
They were in a little cave.

00:25:24.831 --> 00:25:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
maybe in the morning.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.621 align:middle line:90%
Well, it started snowing.

00:25:27.621 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:90%
They woke up to snow.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.644 align:middle line:84%
And when they looked down, the
ark was completely covered.

00:25:31.644 --> 00:25:33.060 align:middle line:84%
They said, it's
too dangerous now,

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.730 align:middle line:84%
because we can't really
see where we're going.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And they had to retreat
and go back down.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Ed Davis wrote this account
in his-- the front cover

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:45.520 align:middle line:84%
of his Bible and never
really told anyone

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.850 align:middle line:90%
until he was in his 80s.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.700 align:middle line:84%
It was such a personal
thing, he just

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.590 align:middle line:90%
didn't really talk about it.

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:55.090 align:middle line:84%
He had no agenda
to promote an ark.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of our colleagues
and friends, Dr. Don Shockey,

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:02.740 align:middle line:84%
who finally got to interview Ed
Davis when he was in his 80s.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And Ed's account
in 1943 was very

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:08.420 align:middle line:84%
similar to what
George Hagopian saw

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.820 align:middle line:84%
when he was 10 back
in 1904 and 1906.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And so we see that these
historical accounts

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.922 align:middle line:90%
are very similar.

00:26:15.922 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Going further
back, what about Marco Polo's

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:18.430 align:middle line:90%
accounts?

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:20.263 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Well, you
know, it's interesting,

00:26:20.263 --> 00:26:23.510 align:middle line:84%
because prior to 1840,
the historical records

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:27.160 align:middle line:84%
show that they were seeing
one structure on Ararat.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And they referred
to it as Noah's ark

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.440 align:middle line:90%
or a ship on that mountain.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.870 align:middle line:90%
And so we know that.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:38.800 align:middle line:84%
After 1840, there was a huge
earthquake that hit that area.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Mount Ararat
is volcanic in nature.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's prone to
earthquakes as well.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And in 1840, they had
a huge earthquake.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.700 align:middle line:84%
There was a monastery
that was on the north

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:58.380 align:middle line:84%
side of that mountain
at about 7,000 foot up.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And supposedly they had relics
from the ark in that monastery.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:06.970 align:middle line:84%
There was about 200
people living there.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:10.250 align:middle line:84%
It was an active
monastery prior to 1840.

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:15.000 align:middle line:84%
When that earthquake hit,
it blew the Ahora Gorge out.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.780 align:middle line:10%
The Ahora Gorge is on that
northeast side of the mountain.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.280 align:middle line:10%
And it blew that side out.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.900 align:middle line:84%
That side is deeper
than the Grand Canyon.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So you can't just
go up the thing,

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:84%
because there's cliffs that
are thousands of feet high.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.240 align:middle line:84%
If you're going from the top,
they're thousands of feet down.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, they found
people and artifacts there

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:46.350 align:middle line:84%
from ages ago, people who
aren't wearing modern clothes.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.300 align:middle line:90%
They're 1,000 years old.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.930 align:middle line:90%
They're entombed in the ice.

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting that
when that Ahora Gorge blew,

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.780 align:middle line:84%
it not only destroyed
that monastery

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:05.147 align:middle line:84%
and killed about 200 people,
it suffered this huge ark--

00:28:05.147 --> 00:28:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The ark was fractured?

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: --that was all intact
prior to 1840, broke it in two.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that would
match the accounts

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.570 align:middle line:90%
of Ed Davis and George Hagopian.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.790 align:middle line:84%
They said that they
saw it in two levels.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And then since then we
think it's broken even more.

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so when you went
in with this crew of scientists

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and filmmakers, you had the
advantage now-- to this point,

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:34.230 align:middle line:84%
it's hearsay and it's
part of local lore based

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.450 align:middle line:90%
on their own observations.

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:37.810 align:middle line:84%
So now you're bringing
in some pretty hefty

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:39.850 align:middle line:90%
scientific equipment with you.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the work, once you

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.260 align:middle line:84%
got there, the
window of opportunity

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.500 align:middle line:84%
for working each day and
what kind of instruments

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.790 align:middle line:90%
you were using.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Well,
this expedition,

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.740 align:middle line:84%
I was invited back in 2010 to
be part of the expedition team.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.780 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't go, unfortunately.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:01.180 align:middle line:84%
But this year I was-- in
2013, I was able to go.

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:84%
This was supposed to be the
last major scientific push

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.120 align:middle line:90%
to find Noah's ark.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And so that entails a
small window of time,

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:12.190 align:middle line:84%
usually in August, when
the ice melts back--

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:13.880 align:middle line:90%
is peak if it's going to.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:20.860 align:middle line:84%
The weather is better
during that time frame.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And so you get a small
window of time to go in there

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:26.100 align:middle line:90%
and to try to do this.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the time
frame that we have to go in.

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking using
satellite data imagery.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.650 align:middle line:84%
You're talking
ground-penetrating radar,

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:39.800 align:middle line:84%
which you have to get that
ground-penetrating radar up

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.930 align:middle line:90%
to the summit.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:43.000 align:middle line:84%
It just don't get
their own its own.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.320 align:middle line:84%
You can horseback
some of that stuff

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and most of the equipment
up to 14,000 feet.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:48.630 align:middle line:90%
From there--

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then you
have to carry it.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.837 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: --all has to be taken
off the horses and packed up.

00:29:51.837 --> 00:29:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: And I think we
broke the record for luggage

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.350 align:middle line:90%
on the side of Ararat.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:58.590 align:middle line:84%
We had some 40-something
pieces of luggage

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:02.330 align:middle line:84%
just from the camera crew and
from the scientific equipment

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:03.030 align:middle line:90%
that we had.

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you have any
guides working with you?

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: Oh, yeah.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah?

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: Oh, yeah.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.390 align:middle line:90%
We have local guys.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Some of them stayed
up to cook for us.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And listen, when
you're up that high

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:14.370 align:middle line:84%
and you're living on a glacier,
a little glass of warm tea

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and some bread, it goes a
long way because it's hot.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:23.360 align:middle line:84%
One morning we were eating some
bread in one of the big tents.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And we had generators
and things up there.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.620 align:middle line:84%
We have drills
and things that we

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.540 align:middle line:84%
can drill down
through the ice with.

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And my bread tasted
a little odd.

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:38.185 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Dr. Bryant--
Dr. Bryant, John Bryant

00:30:38.185 --> 00:30:38.810 align:middle line:90%
is from Dallas.

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And he is our
geophysicist, geologist

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:44.940 align:middle line:84%
who brought the
ground-penetrating radar

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.040 align:middle line:90%
with him.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said, does your
bread taste funny?

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:48.473 align:middle line:90%
He goes, yeah.

00:30:48.473 --> 00:30:49.680 align:middle line:90%
It tastes like benzene fuel.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.529 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ah.

00:30:50.529 --> 00:30:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: And I said, it does.

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we asked Adam, one
of the local Kurd boys.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.547 align:middle line:84%
We said, Adam,
our bread tastes--

00:30:56.547 --> 00:30:57.505 align:middle line:90%
our bread tastes funny.

00:30:57.505 --> 00:30:58.687 align:middle line:90%
It tastes like benzene fuel.

00:30:58.687 --> 00:31:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, oh,
they were carrying it

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:01.400 align:middle line:90%
all in the same sack.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.592 align:middle line:84%
They threw the bread in with
the fuel and it spilled.

00:31:04.592 --> 00:31:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they don't bother
to tell you until later.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.133 align:middle line:90%
So you have those little things.

00:31:08.133 --> 00:31:14.750 align:middle line:84%
But it was a huge logistical
task to get the equipment up,

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and then the communication
between the summit and the base

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:23.410 align:middle line:84%
camp, to keep food
and fuel flowing

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.720 align:middle line:84%
between the camps, whatever
needs that you have.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.587 align:middle line:84%
My coat didn't arrive until
the night before I summitted.

00:31:30.587 --> 00:31:32.420 align:middle line:84%
You're talking you have
to have Arctic gear.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.030 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any of that stuff.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.000 align:middle line:90%
So I'm in the summer.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.010 align:middle line:90%
We're leaving in July.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's nothing
Arctic available.

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:40.020 align:middle line:84%
So I had to order my
coat, an Arctic coat.

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.810 align:middle line:90%
It has to come from the UK.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.654 align:middle line:84%
By the time I leave,
it's not at my house.

00:31:43.654 --> 00:31:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh no.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.778 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: So I
leave for the trip.

00:31:45.778 --> 00:31:48.520 align:middle line:84%
I said, if it comes, send
it over to my colleague.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.410 align:middle line:90%
He's going to ship it over.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And the night-- I was at the
14,000-foot camp, high camp.

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:57.240 align:middle line:84%
The night before I
summitted, that red coat

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.400 align:middle line:90%
came up on horseback.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was brand
new in the wrapper.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:01.012 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:32:01.012 --> 00:32:01.650 align:middle line:90%
You must have been happy.

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: It was like
a Christmas present,

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.390 align:middle line:90%
I opened up that coat--

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank God.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.415 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Because
the one I had wasn't

00:32:06.415 --> 00:32:08.230 align:middle line:90%
going to work for the summit.

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:11.982 align:middle line:84%
But you need all that equipment
so you can survive on the top

00:32:11.982 --> 00:32:12.690 align:middle line:90%
and do your work.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:13.314 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:32:13.314 --> 00:32:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And now when we're
talking about you

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.980 align:middle line:84%
had the ability to
take ice core samples.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.880 align:middle line:84%
You also had the
ability-- didn't

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.245 align:middle line:84%
you have computers with you also
that were communicating data?

00:32:23.245 --> 00:32:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: Yes.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:25.703 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This was a
sophisticated operation

00:32:25.703 --> 00:32:26.220 align:middle line:90%
as they go.

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: It really is.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.860 align:middle line:84%
That GPR scans, you had to
pull that sled, by the way,

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.560 align:middle line:90%
manually.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Everything that was
done on the top, I did.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I tried to do everything I
could, because everyone plays

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.070 align:middle line:90%
a critical role up there.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And you have to double and
triple your roles sometimes

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:47.490 align:middle line:90%
just to make it work.

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:49.820 align:middle line:84%
I have a background in
the medical field as well.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I doubled
as the team medic.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was the
archaeologist on the dig.

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:02.550 align:middle line:84%
One of our lead archaeologists,
Dr. Randall Price,

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:06.830 align:middle line:84%
wasn't able to be on
the mountain that year.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And we fully expected
him to be there.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:13.170 align:middle line:84%
But it just so happened
he wasn't there.

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:16.340 align:middle line:84%
So I was there for
the first time.

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.110 align:middle line:84%
But you have all
these factors coming

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:23.590 align:middle line:84%
at you and a lot of
obstacles to overcome,

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:26.090 align:middle line:84%
a lot of challenges
on that mountain.

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:29.350 align:middle line:84%
But once you're up there, you
have about three to four hours

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:30.639 align:middle line:90%
of time to work.

00:33:30.639 --> 00:33:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Each day?

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: Each day.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And just walking from your
tent over to the dig site--

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before
you're socked in.

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: It's
incredibly taxing.

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, Brent,
who's the producer/director

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:45.210 align:middle line:84%
of the film-- our
dig site's here.

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:47.080 align:middle line:90%
Your camp's over here.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And the Ahora Gorge is
right over this way.

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:50.970 align:middle line:90%
You're on a slope.

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:53.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
nothing level up there.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And about 3 o'clock every day,
the clouds would come over.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.760 align:middle line:90%
You'd get socked in.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
difficult to work.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:03.900 align:middle line:84%
You only had four good
hours, really, a day to work.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And you would walk
in the distance

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and then you would lose
people in the distance because

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.590 align:middle line:90%
of the fog.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:13.260 align:middle line:90%
And you would get disoriented.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And Brent actually started
walking towards the Ahora

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Gorge, thinking he was walking
to his tent, when he realized

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.250 align:middle line:84%
this is getting
a little steeper.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:21.480 align:middle line:90%
How disastrous.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.889 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: He just
didn't really recognize--

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:24.380 align:middle line:84%
he saw the rocks
were way over here

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.005 align:middle line:84%
and they were supposed
to be over here.

00:34:26.005 --> 00:34:28.639 align:middle line:84%
And then he recognized, I'm
going towards Ahora Gorge

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:29.920 align:middle line:90%
instead of towards my tent.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And listen, if you go
off the Ahora Gorge,

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:35.250 align:middle line:84%
you may not come back if
you don't know where you're

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:37.500 align:middle line:84%
going, because you're
talking hidden crevasses.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:41.780 align:middle line:84%
One of our cameraman, David
Lamb, was right in front of me.

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.894 align:middle line:84%
And we was talking
about the crevasses.

00:34:43.894 --> 00:34:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I said, David, watch for the
crevasses because they're here.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.739 align:middle line:84%
Soon as I said that, he stepped
through a crevasse right

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:51.960 align:middle line:90%
in front of me.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.900 align:middle line:90%
And he was able to stop himself.

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.949 align:middle line:90%
But the crevasse kept going.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:35:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And he was trying to hand
me this expensive camera,

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:00.980 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hang on
with his fingernails.

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:01.370 align:middle line:90%
Oh, goodness.

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: And I told David,
I said, please, give me

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.550 align:middle line:90%
your hand, you know.

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:05.050 align:middle line:90%
And we pulled him out of there.

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:07.769 align:middle line:84%
But it's quite dangerous
on that mountain.

00:35:07.769 --> 00:35:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:11.710 align:middle line:84%
So the $64,000
question is, OK, so you

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.320 align:middle line:84%
have the
ground-penetrating radar

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and you have this communication
going back and forth.

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Give us an idea of some of what
was discovered once you were

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.084 align:middle line:84%
able to actually get a few
hours work done each day.

00:35:22.084 --> 00:35:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Well,
you know, what we

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.470 align:middle line:84%
did was we started from
the previous season.

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And the previous
season they had gone

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:34.620 align:middle line:84%
down 35 feet in the
ice, a square hole down.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.250 align:middle line:84%
They thought they
had-- they thought

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:40.140 align:middle line:84%
they had the ark pinpointed
to this location.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.640 align:middle line:84%
But when they went down,
they didn't hit anything

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.660 align:middle line:90%
after 35 feet.

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:47.140 align:middle line:84%
So when we were there,
they said, well,

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.120 align:middle line:84%
we need to scoot
over a little bit.

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And we need to start
finding out where we're at.

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Bryant wasn't
there immediately.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:36:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So I began a grid, where
you take the ice core drill

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and you have to drill
down through all that ice.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:07.830 align:middle line:84%
You're talking a lot of
ice just to find-- just

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:08.620 align:middle line:90%
to hit something.

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, you want
to sample something

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:13.390 align:middle line:84%
before you dig another 35
foot hole through that ice.

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:15.850 align:middle line:84%
You want to make sure that
you're on something before you

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:18.205 align:middle line:84%
put that kind of--
invest that kind of labor

00:36:18.205 --> 00:36:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and manpower and
effort and energy

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:22.550 align:middle line:84%
into digging that
kind of hole again.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So we decided we're going
to drill with ice core auger

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.610 align:middle line:90%
drills.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:30.290 align:middle line:84%
A fantastic father and son
team, Bill and Will Hughes,

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:32.960 align:middle line:84%
was the backbone
of that operation

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and another archaeologist
colleague of mine, Bruce Hall.

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And they were really
the three guys

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.570 align:middle line:90%
who made that operation happen.

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And without them, you
don't have a drill team.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.400 align:middle line:90%
That's taxing work.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.140 align:middle line:90%
It is hard work.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.190 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
someone on the auger

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:53.550 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't drop in the hole
when you put another auger on.

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got a guy running
the machine to drill it down.

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And you've got a guy
grabbing another auger.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to put those
on as you're drilling down.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you go over
to the next one.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:07.270 align:middle line:84%
So the drilling effort
persisted every day

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:09.070 align:middle line:90%
through a grid pattern.

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:11.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we want to know.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.680 align:middle line:84%
We want to know where
we're at, where we've been,

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and where we're going so we can
find out where this thing is.

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a needle
in a haystack search.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.630 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:25.827 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you finally--
did you find something?

00:37:25.827 --> 00:37:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Well, what
we found was something

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.505 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't expect to find.

00:37:30.505 --> 00:37:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we drill all
the way down to the gravel,

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.830 align:middle line:90%
to the bedrock.

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And then you come up
with gravel and pieces.

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:42.320 align:middle line:84%
But what we found was we found
some interesting things that

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:46.160 align:middle line:84%
really give us a question,
why would this be up here?

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Why would something that
doesn't really belong up here

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:51.584 align:middle line:90%
be up here?

00:37:51.584 --> 00:37:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And so those are
things that we're

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.410 align:middle line:84%
searching for using
the satellite data

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:57.320 align:middle line:84%
imagery, of course,
from NASA, that--

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It relays
back a 3D kind of image?

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.115 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: The
satellite imagery--

00:38:02.115 --> 00:38:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
ground-penetrating radar?

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.288 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: The
ground-penetrating--

00:38:05.288 --> 00:38:08.300 align:middle line:84%
the GPR scan did
reveal the 3D imagery,

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:11.420 align:middle line:84%
with the newer technology
that Dr. Bryant brought.

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:17.960 align:middle line:84%
The satellite imagery was
from real-time imagery

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:22.090 align:middle line:84%
that was giving us access
from a bird's eye view.

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that
just this past summer,

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:30.720 align:middle line:84%
a private entity launched
another satellite

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:35.160 align:middle line:84%
with a 12-inch
lens that is going

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.410 align:middle line:84%
to be able to give
high resolution photos

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:41.180 align:middle line:84%
of whatever they are
taking photos of.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And not so much just
the higher resolution,

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:47.740 align:middle line:84%
but it can pick up
textures, different textures

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:48.920 align:middle line:90%
of the ground.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And so we know from one
of the previous satellite

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.810 align:middle line:84%
imageries that was done was that
there was an area of texture

00:38:55.810 --> 00:39:00.310 align:middle line:84%
that was different,
that was not rock.

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:01.300 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't the ice.

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.900 align:middle line:90%
It was different.

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.200 align:middle line:84%
So we're hoping that this
newer satellite imagery will

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.720 align:middle line:84%
be able to show what
this texture is.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Is it wood?

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.700 align:middle line:90%
Is it rock?

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:12.230 align:middle line:90%
Is it ice?

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.470 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And so that satellite
has now been launched.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:20.290 align:middle line:84%
But when you're looking at
this whole valley full of ice,

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:23.920 align:middle line:84%
you know, Ed Davis in
1943, that whole valley is

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.942 align:middle line:90%
under 60 to 90 feet of ice now.

00:39:26.942 --> 00:39:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And how deep were
you able to dig

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.075 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
ice core samples?

00:39:32.075 --> 00:39:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Well, I mean, we
went all the way to bedrock.

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:40.030 align:middle line:84%
We would go all the
way down until we

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:43.860 align:middle line:84%
were firmly able to say, OK,
we've gone down to the bottom.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking a lot
of augers, a lot of-- you

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.480 align:middle line:84%
know, you lose an auger
down in one of those holes,

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.880 align:middle line:84%
especially your
core drilling bits,

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.750 align:middle line:90%
and you're out of business.

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:58.680 align:middle line:90%
You're out of operation.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:39:59.890 align:middle line:90%
And we lost one.

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:02.710 align:middle line:84%
We only lost one
in the whole time.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:05.844 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it's really
interesting that when

00:40:05.844 --> 00:40:07.510 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at the
satellite imagery,

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking at the GPR,
and Dr. Bryant plugs all that

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:15.870 align:middle line:84%
into the computer, and
it has to be interpreted.

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:16.900 align:middle line:90%
It gets sent back.

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.670 align:middle line:90%
It gets sent back to the States.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And then it gets sent back to
us, where we can look at that.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's anomalies
under the ice.

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And you have to identify
what those anomalies are.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
investigate every anomaly.

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:32.780 align:middle line:90%
So it's a lot of work.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So OK,
now are you going--

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:39.106 align:middle line:84%
will they go back again, or
was this the last expedition?

00:40:39.106 --> 00:40:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Well,
it's interesting

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.890 align:middle line:84%
that supposedly
this was going to be

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:48.490 align:middle line:84%
the last expedition for
the search for Noah's ark.

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But did you
find enough anomalies that

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:51.250 align:middle line:90%
it's worth--

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: There's
still alternate science

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.880 align:middle line:90%
that we're looking at.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.950 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
that if the ark is

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:00.100 align:middle line:84%
broken in multiple
pieces, which we think

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.050 align:middle line:84%
it is-- we know after
the 1840 earthquake

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:04.020 align:middle line:90%
it broke in two pieces.

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.770 align:middle line:84%
We think it's now
in probably four.

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:12.690 align:middle line:84%
But if it's in pieces and it's
down that Ahora Gorge side,

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:14.800 align:middle line:84%
it's a very difficult
thing to find.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So one of our alternative
spots that we would like to hit

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:20.142 align:middle line:90%
is the Ahora Gorge.

00:41:20.142 --> 00:41:21.766 align:middle line:84%
But getting in there
is so treacherous.

00:41:21.766 --> 00:41:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
sounds so dangerous.

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:23.692 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: It really is.

00:41:23.692 --> 00:41:24.630 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, I
mean, how is that

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:26.900 align:middle line:84%
even possible from
what you've described?

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.483 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Well, you would have
to either-- you would probably

00:41:29.483 --> 00:41:31.140 align:middle line:84%
have to go from the
bottom to the top.

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And look, when you do that,
those boulders coming down

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:36.750 align:middle line:90%
do not stop.

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't ever been on
that side from the bottom.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.780 align:middle line:84%
But from people that
have been through there,

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.610 align:middle line:90%
it's very, very dangerous.

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:49.435 align:middle line:84%
Going from the top, those cliffs
are thousands of feet deep.

00:41:49.435 --> 00:41:52.110 align:middle line:84%
That area's deeper
than the Grand Canyon.

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know how
you would do it.

00:41:54.180 --> 00:42:01.820 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, until we get
some more areas of opportunity

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.900 align:middle line:84%
or windows of opportunity
where we can go back and search

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:07.660 align:middle line:84%
for this alternate
location-- I think we should,

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:10.592 align:middle line:84%
it's just can we get
in there and confirm.

00:42:10.592 --> 00:42:12.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
part of the reason

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:16.620 align:middle line:84%
I went was to confirm,
verify, if there's

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.820 align:middle line:90%
a structure on Greater Ararat.

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
seeking to answer.

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when
we watch the film,

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.670 align:middle line:84%
will we be able to see
some of the imagery

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:26.874 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about?

00:42:26.874 --> 00:42:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: Yeah, I think so.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:32.770 align:middle line:84%
The film is-- it's a full-length
theatrical documentary film.

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be released
probably in the late fall

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.940 align:middle line:90%
or in the winter of 2014.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it's probably going
to be in a theater near you

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.040 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:48.510 align:middle line:84%
It is really going to
be an excellent film.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:50.930 align:middle line:84%
These guys filmed
in high definition

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and never before places where
you just can't get into hardly.

00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:00.120 align:middle line:84%
But these guys went in
and filmed these areas

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:04.550 align:middle line:84%
and got some really excellent
footage, superb filming,

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and really professional
throughout the whole thing.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And not only did they
film on the mountain,

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:15.420 align:middle line:84%
though, this film has taken them
to at least a dozen countries

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:19.880 align:middle line:84%
filming other people,
experts in the field,

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and getting expert testimony
and looking at, really,

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:25.900 align:middle line:90%
a rounded picture.

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.864 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one of the most
complete portraits.

00:43:28.864 --> 00:43:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: I think so.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:34.030 align:middle line:84%
It's really going to be a
comprehensive story from not

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:37.000 align:middle line:84%
only the historical searches,
but what's being done now.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.555 align:middle line:84%
The film's really about
the intrepid explorers,

00:43:39.555 --> 00:43:43.710 align:middle line:90%
you know, searching for answers.

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:45.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a quest for truth.

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.960 align:middle line:84%
But not just a quest
for truth, it's

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:51.020 align:middle line:84%
really about a testament
to the human spirit,

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:54.140 align:middle line:84%
about why men go on
these perilous journeys

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and explore for
something that's unknown.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Why would people go do that?

00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:59.800 align:middle line:90%
Why would I go do that?

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And for me, when I
had to ask myself

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:06.130 align:middle line:84%
the question, why would
I-- why am I doing this,

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:09.470 align:middle line:84%
it's because I realized that
this is greater than me.

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:11.550 align:middle line:90%
It's greater than one person.

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:16.680 align:middle line:84%
This find would represent
one of the greatest

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.490 align:middle line:90%
archaeological finds in history.

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: And if it's
that-- if that's confirmed,

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and if we can,
say, independently

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:31.020 align:middle line:84%
verify and document a
structure such as Noah's ark

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.800 align:middle line:84%
on Greater Ararat,
it would change

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.065 align:middle line:90%
everything we know in history.

00:44:34.065 --> 00:44:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: It would
really change everything.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is that in itself
the most profound aspect

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:40.664 align:middle line:90%
of this expedition for you?

00:44:40.664 --> 00:44:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: I think so.

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it really is, because
it's-- you're part of something

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:49.120 align:middle line:90%
that's greater than yourself.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.880 align:middle line:90%
You're part of history.

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.164 align:middle line:84%
And look, a lot of people
talk about going to do things.

00:44:55.164 --> 00:44:57.580 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people talk about,
well, they haven't found this,

00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:58.650 align:middle line:90%
they haven't found this.

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:00.645 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of talk out there.

00:45:00.645 --> 00:45:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And I love discussions,
and I really do.

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's another thing to go
there and search for yourself.

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:08.730 align:middle line:84%
It's another thing to
say, you know what?

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:10.960 align:middle line:84%
I've actually been
on Mount Ararat,

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:16.970 align:middle line:84%
and this is my experience
on the mountain.

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a whole
lot different.

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Life is really
about perspectives.

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And when you go
first-hand and you explore

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.660 align:middle line:84%
these things for yourself
and the perspective you

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:32.610 align:middle line:84%
get from that experience, it
really changes everything.

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I bet it does.

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:35.230 align:middle line:90%
Is your son proud of you?

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: He is.

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:37.987 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
didn't let him down.

00:45:37.987 --> 00:45:38.653 align:middle line:90%
>>JUDKINS: Yeah.

00:45:38.653 --> 00:45:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Dad made it to the top,
and Dad came back now.

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:41.783 align:middle line:90%
But you know, I asked him.

00:45:41.783 --> 00:45:44.190 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know, my
grandparents were rockhounds.

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:46.410 align:middle line:90%
And I grew up hunting for rocks.

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:47.365 align:middle line:90%
I love rocks.

00:45:47.365 --> 00:45:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:49.170 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful crystal here.

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:53.012 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: And that's how I
got started, just inquisitive

00:45:53.012 --> 00:45:53.970 align:middle line:90%
and enjoyed doing that.

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:55.594 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you want
Daddy to bring you

00:45:55.594 --> 00:45:57.815 align:middle line:90%
back a rock from Mount Ararat?

00:45:57.815 --> 00:45:58.940 align:middle line:90%
And of course, he said yes.

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.560 align:middle line:84%
But he said Daddy, I
just want you come home.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.141 align:middle line:84%
And so you know,
when you go out there

00:46:04.141 --> 00:46:05.890 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to do
something like that,

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to come down
in one piece-- it was hard.

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Coming down was even
harder than going up.

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:14.470 align:middle line:84%
It was brutal coming
down, because the weight

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:17.440 align:middle line:84%
and the impact on your
knees and your feet.

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And listen, what took me five
days to summit Mount Ararat,

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:25.520 align:middle line:84%
it took me 12 hours to
descend, all in one day,

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.070 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted
off that mountain.

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:28.029 align:middle line:90%
I was ready to get off.

00:46:28.029 --> 00:46:28.611 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:46:28.611 --> 00:46:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: But I came from
the summit down to the bottom

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.120 align:middle line:90%
all in one day.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was sure glad to
get off that mountain.

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I bet you were.

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:39.742 align:middle line:10%
And so we can find that
at findingnoah.com, right?

00:46:39.742 --> 00:46:41.450 align:middle line:10%
>>JUDKINS: That's
right. findingnoah.com,

00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:43.170 align:middle line:10%
that's the film website.

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:44.586 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's
the film website.

00:46:44.586 --> 00:46:46.420 align:middle line:10%
And your personal
website, aaronjudkins.com.

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:47.961 align:middle line:10%
And then they can
find out about some

00:46:47.961 --> 00:46:49.620 align:middle line:10%
of the other intrepid
adventures you've

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.097 align:middle line:10%
been up to throughout
your career.

00:46:51.097 --> 00:46:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Oh, I've
been all over the world.

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:54.080 align:middle line:90%
I really love it.

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.640 align:middle line:90%
It's really quite an adventure.

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Every time you go out,
it's something new.

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:02.390 align:middle line:84%
When you find an artifact that's
been laying in the dirt-- to me

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:03.670 align:middle line:90%
digging in the dirt's fun.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.955 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:03.955 --> 00:47:04.496 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:47:04.496 --> 00:47:08.710 align:middle line:10%
>>JUDKINS: But those
artifacts, those objects, those

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:09.630 align:middle line:10%
tell a story.

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:10.462 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:10.462 --> 00:47:12.170 align:middle line:10%
>>JUDKINS: And Noah's
ark on Mount Ararat

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:14.000 align:middle line:10%
definitely tells a story.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank
you so much, Aaron.

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:17.007 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDKINS: Thank
you for having me.

00:47:17.007 --> 00:47:18.590 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, the
title of the film

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:21.390 align:middle line:10%
is "Finding Noah," which is out
in theaters around the country.

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:23.450 align:middle line:10%
As Aaron said,
this artifact will

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:26.030 align:middle line:10%
validate the long-held
tale that humanity

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:28.290 align:middle line:10%
has been subjected to
catastrophic floods

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:31.080 align:middle line:10%
in our deep history, which
in itself has changed

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.220 align:middle line:10%
our human direction and history.

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:54.944 align:middle line:90%
