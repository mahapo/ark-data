[ Music & Noise ]

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:22.689 align:middle line:84%
>> For those of you who are
seeking a deeper understanding

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.525 align:middle line:84%
of the fabric of reality,
including their own lives,

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.261 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca has been
a facilitator.

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:29.997 align:middle line:84%
As with a number
of my interviewees,

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:32.866 align:middle line:84%
Author Graham Hancock has
placed his Ayahuasca journeys

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.901 align:middle line:84%
as among the most sacred
events of his life.

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:38.405 align:middle line:84%
He believes that with the
help of mind expanding agents,

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:41.074 align:middle line:84%
we will better be able to
piece together the deep history

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.609 align:middle line:90%
of the human experience,

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.711 align:middle line:84%
where archeological
evidence leaves off,

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.047 align:middle line:84%
our collective memory
can fill in the gaps.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.448 align:middle line:90%
I met with Graham in Scottsdale,

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.051 align:middle line:84%
Arizona at the Earth-Keeper's
Conference to speak

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:55.689 align:middle line:84%
about Ayahuasca and the right to
sovereignty over our own minds.

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.025 align:middle line:90%
It's good to see you again.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.292 align:middle line:90%
It's been a couple of years.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:01.728 align:middle line:84%
Last time we sat together,
you had just finished--

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.064 align:middle line:84%
I think you only had advance
copies of Entangled,--

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>> -- which was very interesting
'cause it was your first work

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.403 align:middle line:84%
of fiction, and you didn't
know how it was going to fly.

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:10.704 align:middle line:90%
How did it fly?

00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:14.007 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's been rather
difficult to reinvent myself

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:16.510 align:middle line:90%
as a novelist in my 60's.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.813 align:middle line:84%
The publishing industry
likes to keep me in a box

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:21.948 align:middle line:90%
of writing non-fiction.

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:27.587 align:middle line:84%
But I feel as a creative
artist that it's my right

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.856 align:middle line:84%
to explore other
areas of my craft.

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.224 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:35.362 align:middle line:84%
>> And I felt very strongly
called for some time to do some

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:37.531 align:middle line:84%
of my work in the
realm of fiction.

00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:40.267 align:middle line:90%
But it's very difficult.

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:43.236 align:middle line:84%
I've had many big
bestsellers in non-fiction.

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.439 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes. You're cash
cow in that genre.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.108 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes. And now starting
out writing fiction,

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:51.611 align:middle line:84%
it's like starting again
from the beginning.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.947 align:middle line:84%
It's like being 25
again, you know.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:57.384 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm completely
unknown as a novelist

00:01:57.384 --> 00:02:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and the publishing industry
reluctantly publishes my novels

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.825 align:middle line:84%
but doesn't particularly want
to push them or promote them.

00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:08.962 align:middle line:84%
So, it's very-- so Entangled,
those who've read it,

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.764 align:middle line:84%
seem to have visceral
reactions to it.

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:13.033 align:middle line:84%
People either love it or
hate it, which is fine.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:14.534 align:middle line:90%
I'm very happy with either.

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:16.002 align:middle line:90%
But not a vast majority.

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.471 align:middle line:84%
>> It means they're not
sleeping through it.

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:19.739 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, not a vast number
of people have read it.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.943 align:middle line:84%
>> So the interesting thing
we talked about last time was

00:02:22.943 --> 00:02:25.678 align:middle line:84%
that when you are
going non-fiction,

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:27.614 align:middle line:84%
which you're well-known,
very, very well-known for.

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:30.417 align:middle line:84%
I mean I started a lot of my
journey based on your work

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:31.451 align:middle line:90%
about 20 years ago too.

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:32.719 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.856 align:middle line:84%
>> The problem is you keep
bumping up against science

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:38.692 align:middle line:84%
and peer review and
all this sort of thing

00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:40.494 align:middle line:84%
and you are pushing
the envelope.

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:42.662 align:middle line:84%
That's the nature of what
you're-- to do your work.

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:44.029 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.967 align:middle line:84%
>> So by going into fiction,
aren't you able to kind of jump

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:49.903 align:middle line:84%
that [inaudible] a bit and
put forth theories that--

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:52.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Well that's the delight
for me with fiction.

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:52.739 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:53.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Because I don't have

00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:56.510 align:middle line:84%
to bulletproof my arguments
with 2,000 footnotes.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.182 align:middle line:84%
Because to the critics, I can
say, "Relax, it's just fantasy."

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:06.019 align:middle line:84%
But it becomes possible to
explore extraordinary ideas.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.555 align:middle line:90%
So in Entangled, I was looking

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:11.925 align:middle line:84%
at demonic influence
in human affairs.

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:90%
I was looking at time travel.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.896 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at the
role of super na--

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:19.199 align:middle line:84%
of beneficent supernatural
beings such as the Blue Angel

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.467 align:middle line:90%
who features an Entangled

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:24.171 align:middle line:84%
that people have been reporting
encounters with entities

00:03:24.171 --> 00:03:25.972 align:middle line:90%
of this type down the ages.

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:28.175 align:middle line:84%
And science of course
completely dismisses them.

00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:32.178 align:middle line:84%
But I think they've had a huge
role to play in the human story.

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:34.147 align:middle line:84%
>> And a confluence of
history in a new way

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:37.751 align:middle line:84%
where you were putting various
considered primitive original

00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:39.786 align:middle line:84%
peoples together in
the same time frame--

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.055 align:middle line:84%
>> -- interacting
with certain traits.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.357 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean Entangled involve
one young woman, Leoni,

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:47.928 align:middle line:84%
in 21st century Los Angeles
and another young woman, Ria,

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:50.363 align:middle line:84%
24,000 years ago
in the Stone Age.

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:52.933 align:middle line:84%
And it involved altered
states of consciousness,

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:54.968 align:middle line:84%
the use of visionary
plants in the case of Ria

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:58.904 align:middle line:84%
in the Stone Age, psychedelic
mushrooms in the case of Leoni

00:03:58.904 --> 00:04:01.341 align:middle line:84%
in the modern age,
dimethyltryptamine

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:04.277 align:middle line:84%
and then Ayahuasca in
which the active ingredient

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:06.446 align:middle line:90%
is dimethyltryptamine.

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think perhaps these
are also reasons why the mass

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.186 align:middle line:84%
mainstream audience
didn't go for the book

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:16.690 align:middle line:84%
because the book is dealing with
very challenging and edgy ideas.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.924 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.192 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's suggesting that
in these altered states

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:22.829 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness brought
on by visionary plants,

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:25.599 align:middle line:84%
we may have incredibly
important experiences

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.435 align:middle line:84%
which might even
make it possible

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:30.870 align:middle line:84%
to transcend the
barrier of time.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.574 align:middle line:84%
Once we step out of the body,
once we're no longer confined

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:38.778 align:middle line:84%
to the material plane, then the
time space continuum no longer

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:90%
applies upon us.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.315 align:middle line:84%
And it might be possible
to visit different epochs,

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:44.784 align:middle line:84%
perhaps not in physical form,
but in an out of body form.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:48.788 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I considered
and explored in Entangled

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:52.125 align:middle line:84%
because the basic theme
is that with the--

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:55.295 align:middle line:84%
my two heroines are dealing
with a time traveling demon.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.031 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the benevolent
force behind the story,--

00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:59.432 align:middle line:90%
>> Very exciting.

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:03.503 align:middle line:84%
>> -- the Blue Angel needs to
have one person in the timeframe

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:07.374 align:middle line:84%
of 24,000 years ago and
another one today both working

00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:09.242 align:middle line:84%
to fight this battle
of good against evil.

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:11.778 align:middle line:84%
>> It was interesting
you chose heroines.

00:05:11.778 --> 00:05:13.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.447 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, again, when you
speak about your journeys

00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:16.516 align:middle line:84%
of Ayahuasca, which we'll go
into a minute because I want

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:18.385 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
TED Talks controversy

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:90%
that is still roaring.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.756 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, it's Mother
Ayahuasca that you connected

00:05:22.756 --> 00:05:23.957 align:middle line:90%
as a feminine essence.

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:26.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's a curios
thing I find as a writer.

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:30.096 align:middle line:84%
I'm not massively attracted
to writing male characters.

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:33.166 align:middle line:84%
I'm more interested in female
characters and I feel--

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.301 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is that?

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:35.769 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:40.106 align:middle line:84%
I feel that that much that
is noble and nurturing,

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:42.508 align:middle line:90%
and courageous, and powerful

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:46.446 align:middle line:84%
about the human race is
in the feminine side.

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:51.484 align:middle line:84%
I think we live in a
testosterone-driven epoch today

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:53.553 align:middle line:90%
and have done for quite a while

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:57.991 align:middle line:84%
and men have been calling the
shots but with horrific results,

00:05:57.991 --> 00:05:59.492 align:middle line:84%
you know, where there's--
with the--

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:02.228 align:middle line:84%
the balance of the feminine
i's not been allowed in.

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:05.432 align:middle line:84%
And we see this culture of
aggression, and competition,

00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:09.302 align:middle line:84%
and warfare, and conspicuous
consumption, and everything

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:12.072 align:middle line:84%
that goes with that, and I feel
that that comes from a society

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:14.207 align:middle line:84%
that is overbalanced
in the direction

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:17.444 align:middle line:84%
of a particularly
narrow interpretation

00:06:17.444 --> 00:06:19.512 align:middle line:90%
of the male energy.

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:24.250 align:middle line:84%
So I find myself wanting to
honor the feminine in my stories

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:30.724 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to look at the
massive role, hidden, often,

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:34.461 align:middle line:84%
but massive in human
affairs that women have had--

00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:35.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, and--

00:06:35.662 --> 00:06:37.097 align:middle line:84%
>> -- and the [inaudible]
that they have played.

00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:41.434 align:middle line:84%
>> And for whoever doesn't know,
you chose a very powerful wife,

00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:43.737 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful, powerful
being as your wife,

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.472 align:middle line:84%
so you have this
influence in your life

00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:46.573 align:middle line:90%
with Santha all the time--

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:47.774 align:middle line:84%
[Inaudible Remark] --
who is your partner.

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:49.042 align:middle line:84%
And for whoever has read
your book, of course she's

00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:50.844 align:middle line:84%
in beautiful photography
as well.

00:06:50.844 --> 00:06:51.478 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:52.545 align:middle line:90%
She's my partner--

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:53.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're steeped
in this energy and--

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.447 align:middle line:90%
>> -- and my fellow adventurer.

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:55.281 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:58.051 align:middle line:90%
>> And I think I would be lost

00:06:58.051 --> 00:07:00.353 align:middle line:84%
without Santha somewhere
in my life.

00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:01.521 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes. So--

00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:02.389 align:middle line:84%
>> She's been huge
balancing influence for me.

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:03.723 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:06.292 align:middle line:84%
Okay, now let's talk about
the journeys, the Ayahuasca--

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:08.361 align:middle line:90%
Mother Ayahuasca and so forth.

00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:09.462 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:11.765 align:middle line:84%
>> And before we go
into the details of more

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.566 align:middle line:84%
or less your visions
and discoveries,

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:15.802 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about the fact--
you talked about it publicly

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:17.704 align:middle line:90%
at the TED Talks event.

00:07:17.704 --> 00:07:18.772 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I did.

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:21.574 align:middle line:84%
>> And you talked
about your background,

00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:24.544 align:middle line:84%
where you had been doing a
lot of cannabis in the past

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:27.447 align:middle line:84%
and your journey through that
and out the other side of that,

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.515 align:middle line:90%
what had happened with you.

00:07:28.515 --> 00:07:31.418 align:middle line:84%
It was a very personal
and powerful talk.

00:07:31.418 --> 00:07:36.055 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I told the personal
story and I felt naively

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:38.425 align:middle line:84%
that TED was the right
place to tell that story.

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:39.626 align:middle line:90%
>> You were invited, right?

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:42.061 align:middle line:84%
>> I was invited and I was
invited to a conference

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:43.430 align:middle line:84%
of which the theme
was, you know,

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.498 align:middle line:84%
"Challenging Existing
Paradigms",

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:46.800 align:middle line:90%
so I felt write at home--

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.467 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.903 align:middle line:90%
>> -- in that theme.

00:07:49.903 --> 00:07:54.941 align:middle line:84%
And I was also aware that people
in previous TED Talks had talked

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:56.508 align:middle line:84%
about psychedelics,
so I didn't see why

00:07:56.508 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:90%
that should be a problem either.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:05.318 align:middle line:84%
And the personal element
of my story which I relayed

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:08.688 align:middle line:84%
in that talk is very-- is really
very straightforward which is

00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:10.356 align:middle line:90%
that Ayahuasca is known

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:13.259 align:middle line:84%
as a healing agency
amongst other things,

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:16.596 align:middle line:84%
this entity that people all
around the world encounter

00:08:16.596 --> 00:08:18.331 align:middle line:84%
in the Ayahuasca
experience and tend

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.099 align:middle line:90%
to construe as Mother Ayahuasca.

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:24.337 align:middle line:84%
And I was very careful to say
in the TED Talk, I make no claim

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.339 align:middle line:84%
to the reality status
of this entity.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:29.876 align:middle line:84%
I'm simply reporting the
phenomenology that people all

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:31.511 align:middle line:90%
over the world are encountering

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:34.914 align:middle line:84%
in intelligence what they
interpret as in intelligence

00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:36.014 align:middle line:90%
when they drink Ayahuasca.

00:08:36.014 --> 00:08:38.951 align:middle line:84%
And most often, she
appears in female form.

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:42.155 align:middle line:84%
Although she's a shapeshifter,
she may sometimes come

00:08:42.155 --> 00:08:46.192 align:middle line:84%
as a jaguar, sometimes
as a serpent,

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.528 align:middle line:90%
sometimes as a human woman.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:52.365 align:middle line:84%
And she has powerful lessons
to teach us about ourselves.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:56.035 align:middle line:84%
So, although you sense a power
of love in this intelligence

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:59.672 align:middle line:84%
that you encounter, it's
a kind of tough love.

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:01.074 align:middle line:90%
You know, she--

00:09:01.074 --> 00:09:02.909 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have reality reflected
back at you at something?

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:05.678 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. She will not let
you off the hook lightly.

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:08.548 align:middle line:84%
You are confronted with the
truth about your own behavior.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:12.151 align:middle line:84%
And something that was bending
my behavior out of shape

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:19.025 align:middle line:84%
for many, many years was my
own personal abuse of cannabis.

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:22.529 align:middle line:84%
When I talk about cannabis, I
want to make it absolutely clear

00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:26.032 align:middle line:84%
that I have nothing against
cannabis, and I celebrate

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:29.402 align:middle line:84%
and honor the right of
adults, the sovereign right

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.170 align:middle line:84%
to make choices over
their own bodies

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.674 align:middle line:84%
and their own consciousness
to use cannabis

00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:35.875 align:middle line:90%
if they wish to do so.

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:38.778 align:middle line:84%
I believe our society
has no right to intervene

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:42.215 align:middle line:84%
in adult's sovereign
decisions about his or her body

00:09:42.215 --> 00:09:43.583 align:middle line:90%
and his or her consciousness.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:46.452 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, I recognize
a cannabis can be a wonderful

00:09:46.452 --> 00:09:49.222 align:middle line:84%
healing agency for
many people and--

00:09:49.222 --> 00:09:51.024 align:middle line:90%
>> You just went overboard.

00:09:51.024 --> 00:09:52.225 align:middle line:90%
>> I went overboard.

00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:55.094 align:middle line:90%
I was-- I believe that cannabis

00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:57.564 align:middle line:84%
like all the sacred plants
should be treated with respect

00:09:57.564 --> 00:10:03.036 align:middle line:84%
and should not be smoked 16
hours a day, seven days a week.

00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:03.736 align:middle line:90%
And I got a--

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:04.871 align:middle line:90%
>> You had a vaporizer.

00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a vaporizer,
so I was smoking steam

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.509 align:middle line:84%
and no combustion products,
much better for the lungs.

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:10.443 align:middle line:90%
>> You were serious.

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:11.578 align:middle line:90%
>> I was serious.

00:10:11.578 --> 00:10:14.113 align:middle line:84%
I have three vaporizers
a matter of fact.

00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:17.917 align:middle line:84%
I was very committed to
my cannabis relationship.

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:19.752 align:middle line:84%
>> I can't imagine the
world you were living in.

00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:22.322 align:middle line:90%
I was mostly doing that in--

00:10:22.322 --> 00:10:24.757 align:middle line:84%
for a period of time
when I was skiing and--

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:25.692 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:25.692 --> 00:10:26.693 align:middle line:84%
>> -- having a lot
of fun outdoors,

00:10:26.693 --> 00:10:28.261 align:middle line:84%
and it was kind of
ragweed back then.

00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:29.062 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:29.762 align:middle line:90%
>> But this sounds serious.

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:30.363 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very strong--

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:31.764 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:32.832 align:middle line:84%
>> -- in how we're dealing with
very strong strains of cannabis,

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:34.601 align:middle line:84%
and may be that was
part of the problem.

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:37.737 align:middle line:84%
Cannabis, very, very heavily
focused of the THC end

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:84%
of the ingredient,
less on the CBD

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.009 align:middle line:84%
because cannabis has a
range of ingredients.

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:43.443 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:43.443 --> 00:10:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>> And--

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:44.978 align:middle line:90%
>> That creates paranoia.

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:45.812 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's well-known.

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:46.846 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's what I noticed.

00:10:46.846 --> 00:10:48.014 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was one
of my problems was

00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:51.217 align:middle line:84%
that I became paranoid,
suspicious, jealous.

00:10:51.217 --> 00:10:52.585 align:middle line:90%
I didn't trust anybody.

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:56.389 align:middle line:84%
I behaved negatively
towards my wonderful wife

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:58.758 align:middle line:90%
and partner Santha.

00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:00.193 align:middle line:84%
>> You were in the
prison of your own making.

00:11:00.193 --> 00:11:02.996 align:middle line:84%
>> There was lots of ways by
which I was refusing to admit.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.665 align:middle line:84%
And from the moment
that I started drinking,

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:10.303 align:middle line:84%
I was which was in 2003, I
did start to get messages

00:11:10.303 --> 00:11:13.072 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to do something
about my cannabis habit

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:15.141 align:middle line:90%
and would even feel really bad

00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:17.577 align:middle line:84%
about that during
the session itself,

00:11:17.577 --> 00:11:21.047 align:middle line:84%
but I kept going
back to the habit.

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was only in 2011 when
I was already up to something

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:28.421 align:middle line:84%
like 35, 40 Ayahuasca sessions
and I went down to Brazil

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:30.289 align:middle line:90%
for five sessions that's--

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:34.327 align:middle line:84%
and I shall continue to call her
Mother Ayahuasca whether she's

00:11:34.327 --> 00:11:35.728 align:middle line:90%
real or not.

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:40.633 align:middle line:84%
Mother Ayahuasca focused on my
cannabis problem and showed me

00:11:40.633 --> 00:11:44.937 align:middle line:84%
that I was moving in the
wrong direction in my life

00:11:44.937 --> 00:11:49.075 align:middle line:84%
and that I was poised
on the edge of an abyss.

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:53.012 align:middle line:84%
And that if I continue to allow
my behavior to deteriorate

00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:57.483 align:middle line:84%
in the way that it was doing
because of my abuse of cannabis,

00:11:57.483 --> 00:11:59.585 align:middle line:90%
there would be some sense

00:11:59.585 --> 00:12:04.557 align:middle line:84%
in which I might be immortally
doomed that I could not--

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:09.896 align:middle line:84%
that I could not put right the
wrongs and the pain and the hurt

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:11.898 align:middle line:90%
that my behavior was causing.

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:16.569 align:middle line:84%
So, in a way Mother
Ayahuasca took me to hell.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.571 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not claiming
that hell is real either.

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.306 align:middle line:90%
>> It was your experience.

00:12:20.306 --> 00:12:24.877 align:middle line:84%
>> But I was taken to a place
and shown very, very vividly,

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:26.713 align:middle line:90%
this is what you will face

00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:29.482 align:middle line:84%
if you don't fix this
problem in your life.

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:31.017 align:middle line:90%
>> What did that look like?

00:12:31.017 --> 00:12:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>> It looked like something out
of Hieronymus Bosch, you know.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.389 align:middle line:84%
Hieronymus Bosch was a
visionary artist of the 1400s

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:40.793 align:middle line:84%
and he painted hell a number of
times and it looked like that.

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:41.994 align:middle line:90%
And it looked a little bit

00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:45.298 align:middle line:84%
like the Ancient Egyptian
Judgment Hall of Osiris

00:12:45.298 --> 00:12:47.734 align:middle line:84%
where every action, every
thought, every deed,

00:12:47.734 --> 00:12:49.469 align:middle line:90%
every moment of your life is--

00:12:49.469 --> 00:12:52.405 align:middle line:84%
becomes transparent and
you must account for it.

00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:55.875 align:middle line:84%
And I found that where the
heart is wade and the scales

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:57.543 align:middle line:90%
against the feather truth.

00:12:57.543 --> 00:13:02.749 align:middle line:84%
And I found that the bending
out of shape of my behavior,

00:13:02.749 --> 00:13:05.818 align:middle line:84%
of my attitude to the
world that was linked to,

00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:08.421 align:middle line:84%
I would not say it was caused
by cannabis, but was linked

00:13:08.421 --> 00:13:10.990 align:middle line:84%
to cannabis would put me
in a place of jeopardy

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.794 align:middle line:84%
in the judgment hall and that
my heart would not weigh light

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.062 align:middle line:90%
against the feather.

00:13:16.062 --> 00:13:18.831 align:middle line:84%
And this was an alarming
situation for me.

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
There were elements
of those experiences,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.668 align:middle line:90%
those five experiences in Brazil

00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:25.071 align:middle line:84%
which are too painful
for me to recount.

00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:27.874 align:middle line:84%
But the net result is
that when I came back

00:13:27.874 --> 00:13:29.742 align:middle line:90%
to England, I was done.

00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:31.177 align:middle line:90%
>> And that was 2011.

00:13:31.177 --> 00:13:32.278 align:middle line:90%
>> And that was 2011.

00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:33.513 align:middle line:90%
I was done with cannabis

00:13:33.513 --> 00:13:36.014 align:middle line:84%
and I have never
smoked it against since.

00:13:36.014 --> 00:13:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it has been
a wonderful revelation.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.288 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:43.489 align:middle line:84%
>> What did you discover
in yourself

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:45.258 align:middle line:84%
when that was no
longer clouding you?

00:13:45.258 --> 00:13:47.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all,
what I discovered is

00:13:47.026 --> 00:13:48.861 align:middle line:84%
that all the pain--
'cause it was--

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:52.131 align:middle line:84%
jealousy and suspicion were
causing me pain as well as--

00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:52.899 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:55.334 align:middle line:90%
>> -- causing others pain.

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:56.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:56.602 --> 00:13:59.071 align:middle line:84%
>> And the first-- so that
just vanished completely.

00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:00.206 align:middle line:90%
I don't approach life.

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:01.874 align:middle line:90%
I don't approach the world.

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:03.643 align:middle line:90%
I don't approach my wife.

00:14:03.643 --> 00:14:06.412 align:middle line:84%
I don't approach
anybody I meet in a state

00:14:06.412 --> 00:14:08.581 align:middle line:90%
of suspicion or mistrust.

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:11.484 align:middle line:90%
I come from a place of trust.

00:14:11.484 --> 00:14:13.886 align:middle line:84%
And I would rather
trust people now

00:14:13.886 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps be proved
wrong than mistrust them.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:18.191 align:middle line:90%
I don't like--

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:19.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Too painful.

00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:20.059 align:middle line:84%
>> -- being in a
place of mistrust.

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:20.793 align:middle line:90%
It's much too painful.

00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:21.627 align:middle line:90%
All of that is gone.

00:14:21.627 --> 00:14:24.096 align:middle line:90%
I have absolutely no paranoia.

00:14:24.096 --> 00:14:25.631 align:middle line:90%
I have no suspicion.

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:28.367 align:middle line:84%
I feel very comfortable
inside my own skin.

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:32.205 align:middle line:84%
And I don't elaborate
fantasies to worry about.

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:35.775 align:middle line:84%
I feel much more-- much, much
happier and much more relaxed.

00:14:35.775 --> 00:14:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And the big thing that was
worried me about cannabis

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.679 align:middle line:90%
which was that if I stopped it,

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:41.747 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be able
to write my books.

00:14:41.747 --> 00:14:44.417 align:middle line:84%
That turned out to
be total nonsense.

00:14:44.417 --> 00:14:47.887 align:middle line:84%
And that far from
becoming less productive

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.322 align:middle line:84%
since I stopped smoking
cannabis,

00:14:49.322 --> 00:14:51.389 align:middle line:84%
I've become much
more productive--

00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:52.358 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, and I--

00:14:52.358 --> 00:14:53.726 align:middle line:84%
>> -- and like much
more fluently.

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:56.128 align:middle line:84%
>> But at the same time, during
the years you were smoking,

00:14:56.128 --> 00:14:58.464 align:middle line:90%
you were cranking out books.

00:14:58.464 --> 00:15:00.132 align:middle line:84%
It's like people
listening to this would say,

00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:01.567 align:middle line:90%
"How is that possible?

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.536 align:middle line:84%
Those books were brilliant
and there were lots

00:15:03.536 --> 00:15:04.670 align:middle line:90%
of it, dozen of them or so."

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.938 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I was cranking
up books.

00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:07.306 align:middle line:90%
And they were good books.

00:15:07.306 --> 00:15:08.107 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, they were.

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:09.108 align:middle line:90%
>> I would love to tell you.

00:15:09.108 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:90%
I was focused with cannabis.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.612 align:middle line:90%
It would put me into dreamland.

00:15:12.612 --> 00:15:15.281 align:middle line:90%
I was able to work with it.

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:18.451 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you what
sometimes would happen which is

00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:22.655 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes I would
spend an entire day puzzling

00:15:22.655 --> 00:15:24.991 align:middle line:90%
over a three-line paragraph.

00:15:24.991 --> 00:15:26.292 align:middle line:90%
Slowed me down as well.

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:27.593 align:middle line:90%
>> I see, yes.

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:31.564 align:middle line:84%
>> And sometimes, I think
the books got a bit overlong

00:15:31.564 --> 00:15:35.001 align:middle line:84%
because of that process
in a weird kind of way

00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:37.003 align:middle line:84%
that I would kind of keep
coming back in [inaudible].

00:15:37.003 --> 00:15:38.271 align:middle line:90%
>> Kind of felt heavy.

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:39.372 align:middle line:90%
>> A little bit heavy.

00:15:39.372 --> 00:15:41.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's changed.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.943 align:middle line:84%
And also I'm just
much more productive

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:47.013 align:middle line:84%
and I'm finding myself
exploring realms of ideas

00:15:47.013 --> 00:15:49.649 align:middle line:84%
that I actually didn't
explore before.

00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:52.351 align:middle line:84%
I feel that I've opened
up a lot since then.

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:55.488 align:middle line:84%
So I feel that I've had a
monkey taken off my back.

00:15:55.488 --> 00:15:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And again, I want to
emphasize, because I don't want

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:01.627 align:middle line:84%
to be misunderstood on this, I
am not putting cannabis down.

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:03.229 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, I understand.

00:16:03.229 --> 00:16:06.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Cannabis is, for many people,
an incredibly helpful aid.

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:09.068 align:middle line:90%
And there was a time in my life

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:10.870 align:middle line:84%
when it was incredibly
helpful for me.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:14.840 align:middle line:84%
My problem was the
self-indulgent abuse--

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:15.608 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:15.608 --> 00:16:16.309 align:middle line:90%
>> -- of this sacred word.

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I understand.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.611 align:middle line:84%
What I'm wondering, though
you were talking about--

00:16:18.611 --> 00:16:20.479 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about
ragweed from, you know,

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:23.115 align:middle line:84%
a few decades ago and
then what has become now

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:25.985 align:middle line:84%
with this super-hybridized
and specialized product.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.186 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I was smoking.

00:16:27.186 --> 00:16:29.889 align:middle line:84%
>> And that, you said
there is a chemical shift

00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:31.057 align:middle line:90%
from one chemical element--

00:16:31.057 --> 00:16:31.824 align:middle line:90%
>> Well there are--

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:33.159 align:middle line:90%
>> -- to the other.

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:36.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there are two key
ingredients in cannabis and one

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:40.333 align:middle line:84%
of them is THC, and that
is what gets you high.

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:44.136 align:middle line:84%
And the other is CBD, okay,
which doesn't get you high.

00:16:44.136 --> 00:16:49.175 align:middle line:84%
And at the level of the
studies that have been done,

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:55.247 align:middle line:84%
it seems that there is some
risk of THC-inducing psychosis.

00:16:55.247 --> 00:16:56.349 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:17:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>> The CBD is a powerful
antipsychotic agent.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.224 align:middle line:84%
And in the natural herb, these
two ingredients balanced.

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:07.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes. So you giggle
and eat too much.

00:17:07.726 --> 00:17:08.394 align:middle line:90%
>> So it gets you high--

00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:09.428 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:10.329 align:middle line:84%
>> -- but it doesn't
make you paranoid.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:11.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:15.701 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay? But the very
engineered varieties

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:19.638 align:middle line:84%
that we are now dealing with
have almost entirely got rid

00:17:19.638 --> 00:17:23.309 align:middle line:84%
of the CBD and they're
almost 100 percent THC.

00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:24.409 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:17:24.409 --> 00:17:26.078 align:middle line:84%
>> And that I think is
part of the problem.

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:30.316 align:middle line:84%
And if we lived in a rational
society which was not governed

00:17:30.316 --> 00:17:34.286 align:middle line:84%
by the truly insane and
grotesque war on drugs,

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:36.255 align:middle line:84%
then it would-- we
would have this problem.

00:17:36.255 --> 00:17:39.458 align:middle line:84%
The reason we have this
problem is that, you know,

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:43.129 align:middle line:84%
growers are looking for
the maximum amount of high

00:17:43.129 --> 00:17:45.998 align:middle line:84%
that they can concentrate
into a bud.

00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:48.434 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, you know, what we
really should be looking

00:17:48.434 --> 00:17:50.436 align:middle line:90%
for is a balanced experience

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:53.572 align:middle line:84%
which is what the
traditional herb offers.

00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:55.741 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, somebody
like me, I might be--

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:58.778 align:middle line:84%
if I live in a society where
I could make sovereign choices

00:17:58.778 --> 00:18:02.248 align:middle line:84%
over my own consciousness and
I wanted to smoke cannabis,

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.316 align:middle line:84%
I could go to a grower
and say, "Well, you know,

00:18:04.316 --> 00:18:07.586 align:middle line:84%
fix me a strain that's very high
in CBD and very low in THC."

00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:09.255 align:middle line:90%
And that might be-- you know,

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:10.756 align:middle line:84%
I might have a complete
different experience

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:11.390 align:middle line:90%
with that too.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.792 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:18:12.792 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I'm wondering, this is
where my mind is going with it

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.897 align:middle line:84%
which is, okay, now
you have the THC

00:18:17.897 --> 00:18:20.933 align:middle line:84%
and you have a possible
propensity

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:23.836 align:middle line:90%
for producing psychotic states.

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:26.605 align:middle line:84%
When you look at psychotic
states and you look at the entry

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:30.176 align:middle line:84%
of paranoia and influences,
is it possible

00:18:30.176 --> 00:18:32.078 align:middle line:84%
that you're then
also interfacing

00:18:32.078 --> 00:18:35.414 align:middle line:84%
with other dimensional
fields or other realities

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:39.885 align:middle line:84%
that are also may
be boosting some

00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:42.688 align:middle line:84%
of those effects
within the psyche?

00:18:42.688 --> 00:18:44.757 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I think that my work

00:18:44.757 --> 00:18:49.595 align:middle line:84%
over the last few years has
opened me up to this possibility

00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:54.900 align:middle line:84%
which is that the brain is not a
generator of consciousness but,

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.904 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, a transceiver
of consciousness.

00:18:58.904 --> 00:19:00.172 align:middle line:90%
And if that is the case,

00:19:00.172 --> 00:19:04.176 align:middle line:84%
then when you alter the receiver
wavelength of the brain,

00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:06.846 align:middle line:84%
other realms of consciousness
that are normally closed off

00:19:06.846 --> 00:19:08.614 align:middle line:84%
to our sense may
become accessible.

00:19:08.614 --> 00:19:12.952 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is one
of the primary functions

00:19:12.952 --> 00:19:14.720 align:middle line:90%
of the powerful psychedelics.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.524 align:middle line:84%
And that, I believe, is what
is going on with Ayahuasca.

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:21.594 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is one of the
things that really annoyed TED

00:19:21.594 --> 00:19:24.563 align:middle line:84%
about my talk in the sense
that I was suggesting

00:19:24.563 --> 00:19:27.733 align:middle line:84%
that I never claimed
that this is a fact,

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:30.770 align:middle line:84%
I just said that it's a
possibility, that let's consider

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.505 align:middle line:84%
that we are dealing
with some kind

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:36.609 align:middle line:84%
of non-physical intelligence
or non-physical entity

00:19:36.609 --> 00:19:39.712 align:middle line:84%
which has the best interest
of the human race at heart

00:19:39.712 --> 00:19:43.482 align:middle line:84%
and which is using the Ayahuasca
state to communicate with us.

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:46.218 align:middle line:84%
And that was perhaps
why I got my healing

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:47.720 align:middle line:90%
because I encountered an entity

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.822 align:middle line:84%
that did not have the best
interest of the human race

00:19:49.822 --> 00:19:53.626 align:middle line:84%
at heart, would not bring about
miraculous healing experiences

00:19:53.626 --> 00:19:55.194 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not the sole case.

00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:56.929 align:middle line:84%
There are pe-- people
have gotten into admission

00:19:56.929 --> 00:20:00.766 align:middle line:84%
of severe terminal cancers
following Ayahuasca experiences.

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:03.169 align:middle line:84%
Again, I make no
claims about this.

00:20:03.169 --> 00:20:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:05.571 align:middle line:84%
>> But there are many,
many cases on the record.

00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:07.439 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they've also
kicked other heavy drugs.

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:10.442 align:middle line:84%
>> And huge addictions
to cocaine

00:20:10.442 --> 00:20:14.213 align:middle line:84%
and heroin have been
healed as a result

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:16.048 align:middle line:90%
of in counsel with Ayahuasca.

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:20.252 align:middle line:84%
So-- and there's the sense of
this loving intelligent entity

00:20:20.252 --> 00:20:22.087 align:middle line:90%
that lies beyond the veil

00:20:22.087 --> 00:20:27.826 align:middle line:84%
who in some ways using the
Ayahuasca brew to gain contact

00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:29.228 align:middle line:84%
with us at the level
of consciousness.

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:31.263 align:middle line:90%
But, here's the thing.

00:20:31.263 --> 00:20:33.699 align:middle line:84%
It's important I
think to recognize,

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and experiences I've had have
manifested this to me also,

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:40.840 align:middle line:84%
that just as in this world,
in this physical realm,

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.308 align:middle line:90%
there is good and evil.

00:20:42.308 --> 00:20:46.912 align:middle line:84%
So, also in other levels of
reality, there is good and evil.

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>> There are opportunistic
beings.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.748 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:52.551 align:middle line:84%
>> There are opportunistic,
parasitical, vampirish entities

00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:56.455 align:middle line:84%
out there who feed on pain
and misery and suffering.

00:20:56.455 --> 00:21:00.759 align:middle line:84%
And that's the danger when you
enter a deeply altered state

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:02.061 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:21:02.061 --> 00:21:04.797 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the role of
the shaman is so important,

00:21:04.797 --> 00:21:10.035 align:middle line:84%
is that once you open that door
and go through into that realm,

00:21:10.035 --> 00:21:13.105 align:middle line:84%
Mother Ayahuasca is not
the only entity out there

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:15.040 align:middle line:90%
and there are other entities

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:19.111 align:middle line:84%
which have a propounding
negative agenda for humanity,

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and which are likely influencing
humanity even when we're not

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.418 align:middle line:84%
in altered states of
consciousness, perhaps entered

00:21:26.418 --> 00:21:28.420 align:middle line:84%
through dreams, perhaps
in another ways.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Through fatigue.

00:21:29.255 --> 00:21:30.356 align:middle line:90%
>> Through fatigue.

00:21:30.356 --> 00:21:32.558 align:middle line:84%
That there is this--
this is connection.

00:21:32.558 --> 00:21:34.994 align:middle line:84%
And this is why shamanism
is very interesting

00:21:34.994 --> 00:21:38.931 align:middle line:84%
because shamanism says, "Look,
whether you like it or not,

00:21:38.931 --> 00:21:41.333 align:middle line:84%
we are immersed in
unseen realms."

00:21:41.333 --> 00:21:42.534 align:middle line:90%
They're around us all the time.

00:21:42.534 --> 00:21:43.869 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:43.869 --> 00:21:45.504 align:middle line:84%
>> And we better be proactive
in how we deal with them.

00:21:45.504 --> 00:21:46.906 align:middle line:90%
That's what a shaman is.

00:21:46.906 --> 00:21:50.242 align:middle line:84%
A shaman is the person who has
trained and learned the system

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:53.345 align:middle line:84%
to go over there and
master spirits and to deal

00:21:53.345 --> 00:21:55.214 align:middle line:84%
with who is not to
be their victim.

00:21:55.214 --> 00:21:57.249 align:middle line:84%
And may be-- you know,
may be that's what--

00:21:57.249 --> 00:22:01.453 align:middle line:84%
that's what the poor
suffering schizophrenic is--

00:22:01.453 --> 00:22:03.188 align:middle line:90%
>> I've often thought that, yes.

00:22:03.188 --> 00:22:04.823 align:middle line:90%
>> -- is the person who--

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:07.960 align:middle line:84%
is the person who is
open to the other realms

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.962 align:middle line:84%
but does not have the
training or the system

00:22:09.962 --> 00:22:11.297 align:middle line:90%
of control that a shaman has.

00:22:11.297 --> 00:22:12.064 align:middle line:90%
>> No filters.

00:22:12.064 --> 00:22:13.332 align:middle line:90%
>> No filters, whatsoever,

00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:17.102 align:middle line:84%
and cannot manage the
experiences that come through.

00:22:17.102 --> 00:22:19.471 align:middle line:84%
So, shamans are very
useful individuals.

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:21.540 align:middle line:84%
They have trained
often from an early age

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.777 align:middle line:84%
and they have special aptitudes
and abilities in this world not

00:22:24.777 --> 00:22:28.247 align:middle line:84%
to be dominated by spirits
but to master that realm

00:22:28.247 --> 00:22:30.382 align:middle line:84%
and to operate with
confidence and security.

00:22:30.382 --> 00:22:31.717 align:middle line:84%
And so, that when
they enter that realm,

00:22:31.717 --> 00:22:33.185 align:middle line:90%
they're not disoriented.

00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:34.887 align:middle line:90%
They're not in a state of fear.

00:22:34.887 --> 00:22:37.456 align:middle line:84%
They know what they're doing,
and they can manage it.

00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:40.225 align:middle line:84%
So, all of these
to say, and again,

00:22:40.225 --> 00:22:42.728 align:middle line:84%
I claim no factual
basis for this.

00:22:42.728 --> 00:22:43.162 align:middle line:90%
I've done no--

00:22:43.162 --> 00:22:43.996 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:43.996 --> 00:22:44.697 align:middle line:90%
>> -- experiments to prove this.

00:22:44.697 --> 00:22:46.131 align:middle line:90%
I'm simply expressing

00:22:46.131 --> 00:22:49.401 align:middle line:84%
to you what I think may be the
case based on some experiences,

00:22:49.401 --> 00:22:51.103 align:middle line:84%
quite a number of
experiences that I've had

00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:54.473 align:middle line:84%
that there are dark and
negative forces out there,

00:22:54.473 --> 00:22:58.210 align:middle line:84%
as well as brilliant
forces of light and love.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:01.313 align:middle line:84%
And-- that in a sense,
our predicament

00:23:01.313 --> 00:23:02.815 align:middle line:84%
of human beings whether
we're dealing

00:23:02.815 --> 00:23:05.184 align:middle line:84%
in the realm beyond the veil
or whether we're dealing

00:23:05.184 --> 00:23:08.654 align:middle line:84%
in this material realm is always
the predicament to choose.

00:23:08.654 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:84%
We have those choices
between good and evil,

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.359 align:middle line:90%
between dark and light.

00:23:13.359 --> 00:23:16.995 align:middle line:84%
And many people have said
to me, "Oh, you know,

00:23:16.995 --> 00:23:18.464 align:middle line:90%
all is one, all is unity.

00:23:18.464 --> 00:23:20.632 align:middle line:84%
All is beautiful in the
world," this is one reason why,

00:23:20.632 --> 00:23:23.068 align:middle line:90%
by a lot of people, those

00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:25.471 align:middle line:84%
who dislike my novel
Entangled disliked it

00:23:25.471 --> 00:23:28.841 align:middle line:84%
because I showed forces of
darkness and forces of evil

00:23:28.841 --> 00:23:32.444 align:middle line:84%
at work and how they can impact
and influence human beings.

00:23:32.444 --> 00:23:34.046 align:middle line:84%
And that probably we're
not supposed to believe

00:23:34.046 --> 00:23:37.516 align:middle line:84%
in such things because if
we even for a moment suggest

00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:41.453 align:middle line:84%
that such things exist, then it
will make things worse rather

00:23:41.453 --> 00:23:42.488 align:middle line:90%
than better.

00:23:42.488 --> 00:23:46.091 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
actually we do have

00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:47.526 align:middle line:90%
to get to grips with this.

00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:49.661 align:middle line:84%
We cannot stick our
heads in the sand--

00:23:49.661 --> 00:23:50.996 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely not.

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:53.298 align:middle line:84%
>> -- and pretend that there
is no wickedness and no evil

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:55.701 align:middle line:84%
and that all is good and
that all is rosy and perfect

00:23:55.701 --> 00:23:59.204 align:middle line:90%
in the garden, because it's not.

00:23:59.204 --> 00:24:03.842 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, the
horrible character

00:24:03.842 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:84%
in Entangled who's called
Sulpa, who's a demon,

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:84%
who is impacting human behavior,
he's like a sort of Hitler

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.252 align:middle line:90%
of the Stone Age, you know.

00:24:13.252 --> 00:24:15.587 align:middle line:84%
And Hitler could
not have been dealt

00:24:15.587 --> 00:24:18.023 align:middle line:84%
with by everybody sticking
their heads in the sand.

00:24:18.023 --> 00:24:20.592 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point,
evil is so bad.

00:24:20.592 --> 00:24:21.527 align:middle line:90%
You have to fight it.

00:24:21.527 --> 00:24:23.095 align:middle line:90%
You have to take a stand.

00:24:23.095 --> 00:24:25.531 align:middle line:84%
You can't just ignore
it and wish it away

00:24:25.531 --> 00:24:27.199 align:middle line:90%
and cover it in rosy light.

00:24:27.199 --> 00:24:30.335 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and even the most
respected ancient hollowed

00:24:30.335 --> 00:24:34.173 align:middle line:84%
into text all acknowledge
that you have the light

00:24:34.173 --> 00:24:35.007 align:middle line:90%
and you have the darkness.

00:24:35.007 --> 00:24:35.941 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:35.941 --> 00:24:37.142 align:middle line:84%
>> You have forces
on both sides.

00:24:37.142 --> 00:24:39.511 align:middle line:84%
You have opportunities for
learning between the two

00:24:39.511 --> 00:24:40.712 align:middle line:90%
and bouncing off of it.

00:24:40.712 --> 00:24:44.249 align:middle line:84%
>> And what would we have
to learn in this plane

00:24:44.249 --> 00:24:48.187 align:middle line:84%
if we were not obliged to make
choices between good and evil?

00:24:48.187 --> 00:24:50.522 align:middle line:84%
If-- what would we--
what would, in a sense,

00:24:50.522 --> 00:24:53.158 align:middle line:84%
what would be the point
of the human experience

00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:54.960 align:middle line:90%
if there was no challenge in it?

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.397 align:middle line:84%
If there was-- if there was no
point at which we were tested

00:24:58.397 --> 00:25:00.599 align:middle line:90%
to make one choice or another?

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:03.001 align:middle line:84%
If everything was just set
out and prepared for us

00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:06.205 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning by a
divine and beautiful universe

00:25:06.205 --> 00:25:08.874 align:middle line:84%
and all we had to do was
just live unexamined lives

00:25:08.874 --> 00:25:11.343 align:middle line:84%
and just get a-- I don't
see the point of that.

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:14.813 align:middle line:84%
I think the great thing
about this incredible garden

00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:17.783 align:middle line:84%
that we call planet Earth and
the incredible opportunity

00:25:17.783 --> 00:25:20.819 align:middle line:84%
of being born in a human
body is that day by day,

00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:23.388 align:middle line:84%
minute by minute,
actually, second by second,

00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:25.157 align:middle line:90%
we are required to make choices.

00:25:25.157 --> 00:25:25.991 align:middle line:90%
>> Choices, yes.

00:25:25.991 --> 00:25:27.926 align:middle line:90%
>> And those choices define us,

00:25:27.926 --> 00:25:30.963 align:middle line:84%
and we sometimes make
the wrong choices.

00:25:30.963 --> 00:25:33.899 align:middle line:84%
And the great thing about
having a long human life is the

00:25:33.899 --> 00:25:36.635 align:middle line:84%
opportunity to realize that
you've made the wrong choices

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:39.438 align:middle line:84%
and the opportunity to learn
from the mistakes you've made

00:25:39.438 --> 00:25:43.475 align:middle line:84%
and to correct your behavior so
that at the end, you may come

00:25:43.475 --> 00:25:46.778 align:middle line:84%
to that Judgment Hall of
Osiris or the Hall of Maat

00:25:46.778 --> 00:25:52.084 align:middle line:84%
as the ancient Egyptians called
it, and you may look back

00:25:52.084 --> 00:25:55.053 align:middle line:84%
on the course of your own life
rather as though it were a work

00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:58.090 align:middle line:84%
of sculpture that you had been
working on for many years.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:01.193 align:middle line:84%
And here you made a mistake
and here it was a blemish.

00:26:01.193 --> 00:26:03.295 align:middle line:84%
But as you continued,
you improved

00:26:03.295 --> 00:26:04.429 align:middle line:90%
and perfected your work.

00:26:04.429 --> 00:26:07.533 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of it,
what you should be able

00:26:07.533 --> 00:26:11.303 align:middle line:84%
to do is look back and say,
"Through it all, I did good."

00:26:11.303 --> 00:26:13.138 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a beautiful
way of putting it.

00:26:13.138 --> 00:26:16.041 align:middle line:84%
It leaves people with a very
beautiful vision of that.

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:16.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:18.176 align:middle line:90%
>> And if you look at it, to me,

00:26:18.176 --> 00:26:21.680 align:middle line:84%
it seems that the higher
one's tolerance for pain,

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.683 align:middle line:84%
the longer it takes on that
path toward making this

00:26:24.683 --> 00:26:25.717 align:middle line:90%
beautiful sculpture.

00:26:25.717 --> 00:26:27.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:27.085 --> 00:26:29.755 align:middle line:84%
>> And everyone is on their
own path in terms of the amount

00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:31.557 align:middle line:84%
of pain you can handle
before you have

00:26:31.557 --> 00:26:32.824 align:middle line:90%
to make a course correction.

00:26:32.824 --> 00:26:33.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:33.659 --> 00:26:34.426 align:middle line:90%
>> And that we're all doing it.

00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:35.561 align:middle line:90%
>> And we're all doing it.

00:26:35.561 --> 00:26:36.728 align:middle line:84%
>> We're all doing it at
different stages and--

00:26:36.728 --> 00:26:37.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:26:37.496 --> 00:26:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>> -- different lifetimes.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:39.665 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what makes
me think that we are--

00:26:39.665 --> 00:26:41.033 align:middle line:84%
that that's what
we're here to do.

00:26:41.033 --> 00:26:42.267 align:middle line:90%
We're here to learn.

00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:45.938 align:middle line:84%
There's an opportunity
here, incredible opportunity

00:26:45.938 --> 00:26:48.640 align:middle line:84%
for the gradual perfection
of the soul.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.008 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:50.008 --> 00:26:51.643 align:middle line:84%
>> That's where-- that's why
did many lifetimes which I also

00:26:51.643 --> 00:26:53.412 align:middle line:84%
so happen to believe in
and then can approve.

00:26:53.412 --> 00:26:54.212 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, so do I.

00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:55.214 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:26:55.214 --> 00:26:57.082 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so when we're
looking at this,

00:26:57.082 --> 00:27:01.053 align:middle line:84%
going back just a moment ago, we
were talking about the ability

00:27:01.053 --> 00:27:04.122 align:middle line:84%
of Mother Ayahuasca
to connect with people

00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:05.257 align:middle line:90%
who have addiction issues.

00:27:05.257 --> 00:27:06.458 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:09.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that
it's-- rather than chemical,

00:27:09.127 --> 00:27:13.966 align:middle line:84%
might it be that reconciliation
that happens in the awareness

00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:17.736 align:middle line:84%
of those sessions that
actually creates the healing

00:27:17.736 --> 00:27:19.171 align:middle line:90%
that helps a person overcome?

00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:20.372 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, there's definitely that.

00:27:20.372 --> 00:27:21.073 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:21.073 --> 00:27:23.475 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the realization.

00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:26.578 align:middle line:84%
Previously, you have created
all kinds of illusions

00:27:26.578 --> 00:27:30.082 align:middle line:84%
which make it feel okay to
you to have your addiction.

00:27:30.082 --> 00:27:32.117 align:middle line:84%
You might be troubled
by it a bit

00:27:32.117 --> 00:27:34.820 align:middle line:84%
but you've somehow
persuade yourself that--

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.854 align:middle line:90%
>> Rationalize, sure.

00:27:35.854 --> 00:27:37.322 align:middle line:84%
>> -- that this is
right for you.

00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:38.624 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:38.624 --> 00:27:41.059 align:middle line:84%
>> And what Ayahuasca does
is it strip away those veils

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:43.795 align:middle line:84%
and show you that-- show you
that you're doing something

00:27:43.795 --> 00:27:47.432 align:middle line:84%
that is really harming your path
in life, the path that you need

00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:49.368 align:middle line:84%
to be on in order
to learn the lessons

00:27:49.368 --> 00:27:50.869 align:middle line:90%
that you need to be here.

00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:53.538 align:middle line:84%
But that addiction, but that
addicted behavior has swept you

00:27:53.538 --> 00:27:55.907 align:middle line:84%
aside from that and
you suddenly realize,

00:27:55.907 --> 00:27:57.709 align:middle line:90%
"My goodness, this is important.

00:27:57.709 --> 00:28:01.046 align:middle line:84%
I really have to do
something about this."

00:28:01.046 --> 00:28:02.848 align:middle line:84%
And there's an extraordinarily
healing in that.

00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:06.051 align:middle line:84%
It's realization of the
truth about yourself

00:28:06.051 --> 00:28:09.955 align:middle line:84%
which is the key gift that
Mother Ayahuasca brings

00:28:09.955 --> 00:28:12.157 align:middle line:84%
and she brings it again
and again to all sorts

00:28:12.157 --> 00:28:13.392 align:middle line:84%
of different people
and all sorts

00:28:13.392 --> 00:28:14.526 align:middle line:90%
of different walks of life.

00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:18.697 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have to
be to do with addiction.

00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:22.167 align:middle line:84%
It could be somebody in a
powerful management position

00:28:22.167 --> 00:28:24.970 align:middle line:84%
who was recent to that
position through bullying

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.305 align:middle line:90%
and control and opportunism.

00:28:27.305 --> 00:28:29.307 align:middle line:84%
And I've known people
who've drank Ayahuasca

00:28:29.307 --> 00:28:31.543 align:middle line:84%
for the first time would
be in that situation

00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and I've just felt strongly
motivated to turn their lives

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:84%
around and not repeat
that behavior.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.419 align:middle line:84%
Because, first of all,
they've understood the pain

00:28:40.419 --> 00:28:42.120 align:middle line:84%
that it's caused to
others and, secondly,

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.589 align:middle line:84%
they've understood the damage
that it's doing to themselves.

00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:48.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes. And when you look at
it more as an anthropologist,

00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:50.729 align:middle line:84%
if that many people
from all corners

00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:53.965 align:middle line:84%
of the world are having the
same visions, the same images,

00:28:53.965 --> 00:28:58.270 align:middle line:84%
the same experience, then you
have to say, you call it science

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.572 align:middle line:84%
or pseudoscience or not
science, it doesn't matter.

00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:01.807 align:middle line:90%
There's some reality there.

00:29:01.807 --> 00:29:03.175 align:middle line:84%
>> There's something
extraordinarily going on.

00:29:03.175 --> 00:29:03.975 align:middle line:90%
>> There's some reality there.

00:29:03.975 --> 00:29:05.377 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:05.377 --> 00:29:08.113 align:middle line:84%
>> And, you know, I wanted to
talk about this in my TED Talk

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:10.415 align:middle line:84%
and that's why my
TED Talk got banned.

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:13.218 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's talk about
that whole process now

00:29:13.218 --> 00:29:16.588 align:middle line:84%
because I personally have had
a little bit of a bone to pick

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:18.623 align:middle line:84%
with TED for quite a
while now because I find

00:29:18.623 --> 00:29:20.826 align:middle line:90%
that it always stop short.

00:29:20.826 --> 00:29:24.396 align:middle line:84%
It never satisfies me because
going into the new terrain,

00:29:24.396 --> 00:29:27.199 align:middle line:84%
the new frontiers of
thinking never really happens.

00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:28.800 align:middle line:84%
You get some interesting
concepts.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.469 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying it's not valuable

00:29:30.469 --> 00:29:34.206 align:middle line:84%
and there are some wonderful
talks there, but nothing presses

00:29:34.206 --> 00:29:35.607 align:middle line:90%
through to the next level.

00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:36.408 align:middle line:90%
>> No, this is--

00:29:36.408 --> 00:29:37.375 align:middle line:90%
>> You try to press through.

00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:38.076 align:middle line:84%
>> I tried to press
through that--

00:29:38.076 --> 00:29:39.344 align:middle line:90%
>> And Rupert Sheldrake.

00:29:39.344 --> 00:29:40.712 align:middle line:84%
>> -- asides Rupert Sheldrake,
because he and I spoke

00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:42.948 align:middle line:84%
at the same conference and both
our talks were pulled by TED

00:29:42.948 --> 00:29:45.984 align:middle line:84%
on the same day from
their YouTube channel.

00:29:45.984 --> 00:29:47.953 align:middle line:84%
>> After all of the
evidence and the work

00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:49.254 align:middle line:90%
that you've done that you're--

00:29:49.254 --> 00:29:50.288 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:51.523 align:middle line:84%
>> -- not scientific
in your research,

00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:55.594 align:middle line:84%
that Rupert who we know,
he's done incredible bodies

00:29:55.594 --> 00:29:56.862 align:middle line:90%
of work on morphogene--

00:29:56.862 --> 00:29:57.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Who is a highly [inaudible]
scientist [inaudible]--

00:29:57.562 --> 00:29:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>> -- - genetic fields.

00:29:58.330 --> 00:29:58.864 align:middle line:90%
>> -- enormous amount of--

00:29:58.864 --> 00:29:59.631 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:29:59.631 --> 00:30:00.165 align:middle line:90%
>> -- experimental works--

00:30:00.165 --> 00:30:01.133 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:30:01.133 --> 00:30:02.934 align:middle line:84%
>> -- fairly documenting
his results.

00:30:02.934 --> 00:30:04.603 align:middle line:84%
>> When I heard this, I
just started laughing.

00:30:04.603 --> 00:30:06.004 align:middle line:84%
I thought, "You've
got to be kidding."

00:30:06.004 --> 00:30:07.405 align:middle line:90%
So what did they say?

00:30:07.405 --> 00:30:10.408 align:middle line:84%
>> Well what is was-- I mean,
first of all, and this is all

00:30:10.408 --> 00:30:13.111 align:middle line:90%
up there on record on the web--

00:30:13.111 --> 00:30:14.946 align:middle line:84%
>> There are blogs
still debating it.

00:30:14.946 --> 00:30:16.348 align:middle line:90%
>> Still debating in it.

00:30:16.348 --> 00:30:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, what happened
when TED pulled our talks was

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:22.254 align:middle line:84%
that they put in writing
on a particular blog page

00:30:22.254 --> 00:30:25.924 align:middle line:84%
of their website the series of
reasons why they pulled our talk

00:30:25.924 --> 00:30:28.927 align:middle line:84%
which superficially, you
know, looked persuasive

00:30:28.927 --> 00:30:31.863 align:middle line:84%
that somehow we had--
that our talks were filled

00:30:31.863 --> 00:30:34.332 align:middle line:84%
with pseudoscience,
that they were not based

00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:36.101 align:middle line:90%
on scientific facts.

00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:39.371 align:middle line:84%
And then they said, "Hancock
said this, Hancock said this,

00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:42.073 align:middle line:84%
Hancock said this," and they
said, "Sheldrake said this,

00:30:42.073 --> 00:30:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Sheld"-- but the things
they said we said,

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.778 align:middle line:90%
we didn't say in our talks.

00:30:46.778 --> 00:30:48.547 align:middle line:84%
>> They were trying to
summarize what you said.

00:30:48.547 --> 00:30:49.114 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, no.

00:30:49.114 --> 00:30:50.515 align:middle line:90%
>> I guess not

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:52.984 align:middle line:84%
>> It was as though-- it was as
though they had a preconception

00:30:52.984 --> 00:30:54.853 align:middle line:84%
about what we would
say in our talks.

00:30:54.853 --> 00:30:56.254 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:30:56.254 --> 00:30:58.056 align:middle line:84%
>> And they never bothered to
listen to the talks, actually.

00:30:58.056 --> 00:31:01.593 align:middle line:84%
What they've had some-- some
people had objected to TED

00:31:01.593 --> 00:31:05.397 align:middle line:84%
about these talks and it seems
that TED just immediate reacted

00:31:05.397 --> 00:31:08.166 align:middle line:84%
to those objections without
really studying what was said

00:31:08.166 --> 00:31:09.568 align:middle line:90%
on the talks.

00:31:09.568 --> 00:31:11.803 align:middle line:84%
So they had me-- for example,
just to give you one example,

00:31:11.803 --> 00:31:14.139 align:middle line:90%
they had-- they said that I said

00:31:14.139 --> 00:31:18.944 align:middle line:84%
that drinking Ayahuasca allows
one to make direct contact

00:31:18.944 --> 00:31:21.479 align:middle line:90%
with an ancient mother culture.

00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:22.547 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:23.782 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I am known
to have written books

00:31:23.782 --> 00:31:25.517 align:middle line:90%
about lost civilizations.

00:31:25.517 --> 00:31:27.886 align:middle line:84%
But nothing in my talk
considered the issue

00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:29.421 align:middle line:90%
of a lost civilization.

00:31:29.421 --> 00:31:32.257 align:middle line:84%
And nor did I talk about
an ancient mother culture.

00:31:32.257 --> 00:31:34.259 align:middle line:84%
I did talk about
Mother Ayahuasca,

00:31:34.259 --> 00:31:36.595 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't say she was
helping us to make contact

00:31:36.595 --> 00:31:38.730 align:middle line:84%
with a lost civilization
of the past.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.732 align:middle line:90%
They said I said that.

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:42.067 align:middle line:90%
And so, I challenged them.

00:31:42.067 --> 00:31:43.668 align:middle line:90%
Where in my talk did I say this?

00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Please give me the exact
minute, the exact seconds

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:48.039 align:middle line:84%
where I said this, and five
or six other statements

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:50.709 align:middle line:84%
that they use to justify
pulling down my talk.

00:31:50.709 --> 00:31:53.044 align:middle line:84%
I called them on
each one and I said,

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:56.181 align:middle line:84%
"Tell me where I said
what you say I said,"

00:31:56.181 --> 00:31:57.816 align:middle line:90%
and Rupert did the same.

00:31:57.816 --> 00:31:59.184 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
TED got themselves

00:31:59.184 --> 00:32:01.186 align:middle line:84%
into a really embarrassing
situation

00:32:01.186 --> 00:32:03.388 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't
stand up their objections.

00:32:03.388 --> 00:32:07.492 align:middle line:84%
They actually could not
substantiate any single one

00:32:07.492 --> 00:32:12.964 align:middle line:84%
of the things that
they had said, we said.

00:32:12.964 --> 00:32:16.401 align:middle line:84%
They were profoundly
embarrassed by this.

00:32:16.401 --> 00:32:19.871 align:middle line:84%
They had gone off
half-cocked, as it were.

00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:21.706 align:middle line:90%
They had had some objections.

00:32:21.706 --> 00:32:23.074 align:middle line:90%
They pulled our talks.

00:32:23.074 --> 00:32:26.678 align:middle line:84%
They made up bogus reasons
for pulling the talks.

00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:29.147 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, they were being
asked to justify those reasons.

00:32:29.147 --> 00:32:32.684 align:middle line:84%
And we felt that this was-- that
this was something that needed

00:32:32.684 --> 00:32:34.819 align:middle line:84%
to be on the record and
on the record permanently

00:32:34.819 --> 00:32:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and we have them agree
to this as a kind

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:41.359 align:middle line:84%
of settlement between
us and them.

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:44.396 align:middle line:84%
That their original
statements that they made

00:32:44.396 --> 00:32:48.199 align:middle line:84%
on their website would stand
and they would stand perpetuity

00:32:48.199 --> 00:32:50.902 align:middle line:84%
but they would cross
out every one of them.

00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:51.903 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they did.

00:32:51.903 --> 00:32:54.472 align:middle line:84%
So their entire original
justification

00:32:54.472 --> 00:32:57.976 align:middle line:84%
for removing my talk and the
entire original justification

00:32:57.976 --> 00:33:01.246 align:middle line:84%
for removing Rupert's talk
stand there with lines drawn

00:33:01.246 --> 00:33:02.881 align:middle line:84%
through every word
that they said.

00:33:02.881 --> 00:33:03.748 align:middle line:90%
>> How embarrassing.

00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:05.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:33:05.016 --> 00:33:07.285 align:middle line:84%
Not a single word is left
without a line through it

00:33:07.285 --> 00:33:09.287 align:middle line:84%
because it was all
fantasy on their part,

00:33:09.287 --> 00:33:11.823 align:middle line:84%
not a single world
could be stood up.

00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Then, our videos are now there
on that particular corner

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.630 align:middle line:84%
of their website which Rupert
rather amusingly calls the

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:19.631 align:middle line:90%
"Naughty Corner".

00:33:19.631 --> 00:33:20.332 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:33:20.332 --> 00:33:21.833 align:middle line:90%
It sounds like Rupert.

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:23.234 align:middle line:90%
[laughter]

00:33:23.234 --> 00:33:26.738 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, underneath that are
our rebuttals published in full.

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So they really
stirred up a nest here.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:29.908 align:middle line:90%
They didn't need to do this.

00:33:29.908 --> 00:33:30.742 align:middle line:90%
>> But instead of--

00:33:30.742 --> 00:33:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>> The hornet's nest is-- yeah.

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.845 align:middle line:84%
>> Impertinently
unnecessary hornet's nest.

00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:36.481 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that
they haven't done, however,

00:33:36.481 --> 00:33:39.617 align:middle line:84%
and will not do, and that
they've dug their heels in over,

00:33:39.617 --> 00:33:42.620 align:middle line:84%
is to put our talks back
on their YouTube channel

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.956 align:middle line:84%
where they took them off
from in the first place.

00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:46.424 align:middle line:84%
They keep them in
the Naughty Corner

00:33:46.424 --> 00:33:48.093 align:middle line:84%
and they're now surrounded
by this context.

00:33:48.093 --> 00:33:50.061 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we find them in the
Naughty Corner by the way?

00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the links
are all there.

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:52.831 align:middle line:84%
I can explain it to
you after [inaudible].

00:33:52.831 --> 00:33:54.265 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay, all right, all right.

00:33:54.265 --> 00:33:55.367 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:57.135 align:middle line:84%
>> They're all there,
they're all present,

00:33:57.135 --> 00:33:59.137 align:middle line:84%
and they will stay there
because that's the agreement

00:33:59.137 --> 00:34:00.772 align:middle line:90%
that TED made with us.

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:01.673 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:34:01.673 --> 00:34:02.974 align:middle line:90%
>> That they would stay there.

00:34:02.974 --> 00:34:04.876 align:middle line:84%
And because frankly, they
were defaming us, you know.

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:06.011 align:middle line:90%
This was--

00:34:06.011 --> 00:34:06.711 align:middle line:84%
>> See, I'm being kind
of watching everything

00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:07.579 align:middle line:90%
in the Naughty Corner.

00:34:07.579 --> 00:34:08.979 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah. [laughter]

00:34:08.979 --> 00:34:10.481 align:middle line:84%
>> It would be nice to see more
things in the Naughty Corner.

00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:11.883 align:middle line:90%
>> It sure would be.

00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And some of their big heroes,
you know, like Richard Dawkins

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.622 align:middle line:90%
who gives-- given TED Talks.

00:34:17.622 --> 00:34:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:20.091 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he should be in the
Naughty Corner too, you know--

00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:21.793 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, he should be,
very Naughty Corner.

00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:23.128 align:middle line:90%
[laughs]

00:34:23.128 --> 00:34:23.894 align:middle line:84%
>> -- because there's very
little scientific substantiation

00:34:23.894 --> 00:34:25.296 align:middle line:90%
for anything that he says.

00:34:25.296 --> 00:34:27.632 align:middle line:84%
>> Right. And yet, he so tears
down the work of everybody else.

00:34:27.632 --> 00:34:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.601 align:middle line:90%
>> That's his life's work.

00:34:29.601 --> 00:34:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is a point
that we've made actually.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.638 align:middle line:90%
So it's a curious situation.

00:34:33.638 --> 00:34:37.342 align:middle line:84%
But the net effect was that
I think really what was lay

00:34:37.342 --> 00:34:42.013 align:middle line:84%
at the heart of this was that
there is a powerful lobby

00:34:42.013 --> 00:34:47.084 align:middle line:84%
within science which is involved
in materialist reductionism

00:34:47.084 --> 00:34:50.188 align:middle line:84%
that they want to reduce
everything to matter.

00:34:50.188 --> 00:34:52.923 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually not
a lobby that is based

00:34:52.923 --> 00:34:55.994 align:middle line:84%
on experimental evidence
or a scientific fact.

00:34:55.994 --> 00:34:57.996 align:middle line:84%
It's actually, if you
really examine it closely,

00:34:57.996 --> 00:35:01.132 align:middle line:84%
it's a belief system that
everything may be reduced

00:35:01.132 --> 00:35:04.002 align:middle line:84%
to matter, you know, to
physical aspect of us.

00:35:04.002 --> 00:35:06.471 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, in this
particular view of science

00:35:06.471 --> 00:35:10.408 align:middle line:84%
which is a reference frame, not
a fact, in this particular view

00:35:10.408 --> 00:35:14.846 align:middle line:84%
of science, consciousness is,
and this is how they defined it,

00:35:14.846 --> 00:35:17.315 align:middle line:84%
an epiphenomenon
of brain activity.

00:35:17.315 --> 00:35:19.451 align:middle line:84%
In other words, from the
materialist point of view,

00:35:19.451 --> 00:35:23.788 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is a kind of
accident of material processes,

00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:26.424 align:middle line:84%
that our brains have
to do certain stuff

00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:30.195 align:middle line:84%
so that we can function like
this sort of meat robots

00:35:30.195 --> 00:35:32.197 align:middle line:90%
in the physical realm.

00:35:32.197 --> 00:35:34.933 align:middle line:84%
And because some of that
stuff is complicated,

00:35:34.933 --> 00:35:38.770 align:middle line:84%
accidentally this thing called
consciousness has a reason.

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:39.604 align:middle line:90%
It is produced.

00:35:39.604 --> 00:35:41.372 align:middle line:90%
It is generated by the brain.

00:35:41.372 --> 00:35:45.176 align:middle line:84%
And from the materialist
point of view, when we die,

00:35:45.176 --> 00:35:47.178 align:middle line:84%
the brain stops generating
consciousness

00:35:47.178 --> 00:35:49.414 align:middle line:84%
and that is the end
of our story.

00:35:49.414 --> 00:35:52.984 align:middle line:84%
And many scientific materialists
mistake their personal belief

00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:56.287 align:middle line:84%
system on this matter for a
fact, but it isn't a fact.

00:35:56.287 --> 00:35:57.689 align:middle line:84%
There is no experimental
evidence

00:35:57.689 --> 00:35:59.991 align:middle line:90%
that supports that idea at all.

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:03.962 align:middle line:84%
And another possibility which
I feel really serious and needs

00:36:03.962 --> 00:36:07.132 align:middle line:84%
to be considered is that the
brain is more of a transceiver

00:36:07.132 --> 00:36:09.634 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and that
the relationship is not

00:36:09.634 --> 00:36:12.937 align:middle line:84%
so much the relationship of a
generator making electricity,

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:16.875 align:middle line:84%
but more of the relationship
of the TV signal to the TV set.

00:36:16.875 --> 00:36:23.748 align:middle line:84%
And all of the measurements and
evidence that is used to say

00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:27.919 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is generated
by the brain can be shifted

00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:29.120 align:middle line:90%
over to the notion

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.523 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is not
generated by the brain.

00:36:31.523 --> 00:36:33.958 align:middle line:84%
>> Even Einstein himself
said, "These aren't my ideas.

00:36:33.958 --> 00:36:35.093 align:middle line:90%
I'm just--

00:36:35.093 --> 00:36:36.094 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:36.094 --> 00:36:37.228 align:middle line:84%
>> -- walking or
talking, or showering,

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:38.563 align:middle line:90%
and boom, it's all there."

00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:41.432 align:middle line:84%
>> And consider phenomena
like out of body experiences--

00:36:41.432 --> 00:36:42.367 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:42.367 --> 00:36:43.468 align:middle line:84%
>> -- and near death
experiences,

00:36:43.468 --> 00:36:44.936 align:middle line:84%
universally attested
for thousands of years.

00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:46.037 align:middle line:90%
>> So, old paradigm.

00:36:46.037 --> 00:36:47.839 align:middle line:84%
They're thinking
it's so old paradigm.

00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:49.541 align:middle line:84%
>> Their thinking
is very old paradigm

00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:52.076 align:middle line:90%
and it's unhelpful in a way.

00:36:52.076 --> 00:36:55.246 align:middle line:84%
And at the very least, they
should, I would have thought,

00:36:55.246 --> 00:36:59.284 align:middle line:84%
welcome since they developed
them-- their logo is, you know,

00:36:59.284 --> 00:37:02.453 align:middle line:84%
devoted to the ideas
worth sharing, you know,

00:37:02.453 --> 00:37:04.756 align:middle line:84%
that why not consider
these ideas?

00:37:04.756 --> 00:37:09.994 align:middle line:84%
Even if Professor X or Doctor
Y thinks that they're wrong,

00:37:09.994 --> 00:37:14.232 align:middle line:84%
why not consider them and let
people makeup their own minds?

00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:17.468 align:middle line:84%
Why, you know, operate in
this fashion of saying, "Well,

00:37:17.468 --> 00:37:19.971 align:middle line:84%
we don't believe that people
should be even allowed

00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:21.139 align:middle line:90%
to consider these ideas."

00:37:21.139 --> 00:37:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was a--
[Inaudible Remark] --

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.942 align:middle line:84%
helpful idea when they first
came in but now it's part

00:37:23.942 --> 00:37:25.276 align:middle line:84%
of mainstream media as
far as I'm concerned.

00:37:25.276 --> 00:37:27.078 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very much a part of
mainstream media and I think

00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:29.681 align:middle line:84%
at the root-- so at the
heart of it is this conflict

00:37:29.681 --> 00:37:32.984 align:middle line:84%
between materialist and
non-materialist sides.

00:37:32.984 --> 00:37:33.651 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:33.651 --> 00:37:34.786 align:middle line:90%
>> So I was pleased

00:37:34.786 --> 00:37:35.987 align:middle line:84%
to see Deepak Chopra got
involved in this debate.

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:37.455 align:middle line:84%
>> He wrote a lovely
letter on your behalf.

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:39.123 align:middle line:84%
>> And he wrote a big
open letter on my behalf

00:37:39.123 --> 00:37:41.826 align:middle line:84%
and then he brought in
about 15 other major,

00:37:41.826 --> 00:37:44.128 align:middle line:84%
major scientists
including neurologists,

00:37:44.128 --> 00:37:46.431 align:middle line:84%
professors in anesthesiology,
many others who work

00:37:46.431 --> 00:37:48.566 align:middle line:84%
with consciousness on
the day-to-day basis.

00:37:48.566 --> 00:37:53.104 align:middle line:84%
And they all said that TED was
dead wrong to take these talks

00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:55.540 align:middle line:84%
down and that we do need
exploration of these areas

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.108 align:middle line:84%
and that consciousness
is a mystery.

00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:59.544 align:middle line:84%
And while it remains a
mystery, we should be open

00:37:59.544 --> 00:38:02.113 align:middle line:84%
to what may be considered
by some

00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:03.514 align:middle line:90%
to be extraordinary personality.

00:38:03.514 --> 00:38:06.618 align:middle line:84%
So, in a way, this was
not so much about me

00:38:06.618 --> 00:38:08.119 align:middle line:90%
and Rupert and even the--

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:09.887 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a larger
argument or debate.

00:38:09.887 --> 00:38:11.155 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a big argument
was involved

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:13.524 align:middle line:84%
which is there is a schism
in science and that this--

00:38:13.524 --> 00:38:17.795 align:middle line:84%
and between materialist views of
science and much more expansive

00:38:17.795 --> 00:38:19.530 align:middle line:84%
and open non-materialist
views of science

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:22.166 align:middle line:84%
and it focuses particularly
on the issue

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:24.235 align:middle line:84%
and the mystery of
consciousness.

00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:25.637 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:25.637 --> 00:38:28.539 align:middle line:84%
>> And this in my view is the
scientific problem of our times.

00:38:28.539 --> 00:38:32.944 align:middle line:84%
This is the issue that we should
really be devoting resources

00:38:32.944 --> 00:38:35.346 align:middle line:84%
to studying the mystery
of consciousness,

00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:38.583 align:middle line:84%
far more important to
spend those resources

00:38:38.583 --> 00:38:40.618 align:middle line:84%
on exploring consciousness
than to expend them

00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:41.953 align:middle line:90%
on exploring outer space.

00:38:41.953 --> 00:38:42.887 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:42.887 --> 00:38:44.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Outer space can wait.

00:38:44.255 --> 00:38:48.092 align:middle line:84%
Let's figure out what this
amazing thing that we are is.

00:38:48.092 --> 00:38:50.261 align:middle line:84%
Let's figure out what we
are really doing here.

00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:51.462 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:51.462 --> 00:38:53.131 align:middle line:84%
>> And let's use every
technique possible to find

00:38:53.131 --> 00:38:55.533 align:middle line:84%
out what's going on here
with the mystery of science,

00:38:55.533 --> 00:38:58.169 align:middle line:84%
and actually psychedelics
are one of those techniques

00:38:58.169 --> 00:39:01.572 align:middle line:84%
because with psychedelics,
you can switch

00:39:01.572 --> 00:39:04.742 align:middle line:84%
on deeply altered states of
consciousness exactly when

00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:05.843 align:middle line:90%
and where you want to.

00:39:05.843 --> 00:39:09.147 align:middle line:84%
And then you can bring
together volunteers

00:39:09.147 --> 00:39:12.216 align:middle line:84%
and you can explore
their experiences

00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:13.451 align:middle line:90%
and you can compare notes.

00:39:13.451 --> 00:39:15.887 align:middle line:84%
You could even prepare
questions that you could ask

00:39:15.887 --> 00:39:17.221 align:middle line:84%
to the entities that
are encountered.

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:19.624 align:middle line:84%
I can think of all kinds
of scientific procedures

00:39:19.624 --> 00:39:20.858 align:middle line:90%
that could be conducted.

00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:23.928 align:middle line:84%
You see, if somebody
just falls spontaneously

00:39:23.928 --> 00:39:26.464 align:middle line:84%
into a visionary state, you
can't control when that happens

00:39:26.464 --> 00:39:27.965 align:middle line:84%
and it's difficult
to experiment on it.

00:39:27.965 --> 00:39:28.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:30.001 align:middle line:84%
>> But with powerful
psychedelics,

00:39:30.001 --> 00:39:32.670 align:middle line:84%
you can actually do
that under control--

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:34.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Almost in laboratory setting.

00:39:34.105 --> 00:39:34.706 align:middle line:90%
>> -- under-- exactly.

00:39:34.706 --> 00:39:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:36.607 align:middle line:90%
>> Under controlled conditions.

00:39:36.607 --> 00:39:37.976 align:middle line:84%
So there's-- they're
a marvelous vehicle

00:39:37.976 --> 00:39:39.911 align:middle line:84%
for exploring the mystery of
consciousness, and a great shame

00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:42.780 align:middle line:84%
to our society is so
reluctant to do that.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.016 align:middle line:84%
We're dipping our
toes back in the water

00:39:45.016 --> 00:39:48.086 align:middle line:84%
of psychedelic research now
but it isn't about the nature

00:39:48.086 --> 00:39:49.587 align:middle line:84%
of reality or the
mystery of consciousness.

00:39:49.587 --> 00:39:51.489 align:middle line:84%
It's looking for--
unless it's fine.

00:39:51.489 --> 00:39:52.724 align:middle line:84%
It's looking for
the therapeutic,

00:39:52.724 --> 00:39:54.792 align:middle line:84%
possible therapeutic
benefits of psychedelics.

00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So works being done with
psilocybin, people who are

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:00.331 align:middle line:84%
in the state of the
terminal illness,--

00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:01.666 align:middle line:90%
>> Magic mushrooms.

00:40:01.666 --> 00:40:03.034 align:middle line:90%
>> -- for example,

00:40:03.034 --> 00:40:05.770 align:middle line:84%
given psilocybin often
lose their fear of death.

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:07.472 align:middle line:84%
Why? Because they
have experiences

00:40:07.472 --> 00:40:11.175 align:middle line:84%
of the broader nature of
the universe and they come

00:40:11.175 --> 00:40:14.946 align:middle line:84%
to understand in a deeply felt
way that death is not the end.

00:40:14.946 --> 00:40:19.016 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it's not
something to be afraid of.

00:40:19.016 --> 00:40:22.320 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to see
the research being done,

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.756 align:middle line:84%
not just looking for the
therapeutic potential

00:40:24.756 --> 00:40:27.859 align:middle line:84%
of psychedelic which I'm sure is
enormous, I'm sure it's enormous

00:40:27.859 --> 00:40:29.193 align:middle line:84%
and we definitely
should be looking

00:40:29.193 --> 00:40:31.129 align:middle line:84%
at the therapeutic
potential of psychedelics,

00:40:31.129 --> 00:40:34.565 align:middle line:84%
but also using psychedelics
for a targeted investigation

00:40:34.565 --> 00:40:36.167 align:middle line:90%
of the mystery of reality.

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:37.001 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:39.137 align:middle line:90%
Even as a historical pursuit.

00:40:39.137 --> 00:40:39.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:40.638 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:40:40.638 --> 00:40:41.706 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:41.706 --> 00:40:43.107 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, really,
there are so little--

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:46.043 align:middle line:84%
and you and Santha have
done such a beautiful job

00:40:46.043 --> 00:40:49.514 align:middle line:84%
over the years of
establishing some of the known--

00:40:49.514 --> 00:40:53.751 align:middle line:84%
some of the visible physical
evidences for incredibly--

00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:55.753 align:middle line:84%
incredible mysteries
of the ages,

00:40:55.753 --> 00:40:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and culture is a very high
civilization in technology.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:40:59.857 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:59.857 --> 00:41:02.693 align:middle line:84%
>> But, beyond those
bets and may--

00:41:02.693 --> 00:41:06.597 align:middle line:84%
perhaps Atlantis rising again
is-- was said Edgar Cayce,--

00:41:06.597 --> 00:41:07.932 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:09.967 align:middle line:84%
>> -- it seems to me that
going into this inner frontier

00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:12.270 align:middle line:84%
of memory and connectedness
is how we're going

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:13.938 align:middle line:90%
to piece together our past--

00:41:13.938 --> 00:41:14.639 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:41:14.639 --> 00:41:15.206 align:middle line:90%
>> -- and the cosmos.

00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:15.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, sure.

00:41:15.873 --> 00:41:17.208 align:middle line:90%
And again, you come

00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:22.079 align:middle line:84%
to the schisms involving the
materialist reference frame.

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:24.782 align:middle line:84%
So many archeologists
are committed

00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:26.484 align:middle line:84%
to the materialist
reference frame.

00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:28.419 align:middle line:84%
The only evidence that
they will consider

00:41:28.419 --> 00:41:31.689 align:middle line:84%
about the past is evidence
in the form of pictures

00:41:31.689 --> 00:41:34.258 align:middle line:84%
and objects dug out
of the ground.

00:41:34.258 --> 00:41:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Somebody like Edgar Cayce
who went into trans states

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:43.835 align:middle line:84%
and experienced the past lives
going right back to Atlantis,

00:41:43.835 --> 00:41:46.804 align:middle line:84%
a materialist archeologist would
just dismiss that out of hand

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:50.274 align:middle line:84%
as completely-- complete
nonsense and not something

00:41:50.274 --> 00:41:51.642 align:middle line:90%
to be taken seriously at all.

00:41:51.642 --> 00:41:53.411 align:middle line:90%
And what a pity, you know.

00:41:53.411 --> 00:41:56.347 align:middle line:84%
What a pity because here
is another potential way

00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:58.316 align:middle line:90%
of investigating the past.

00:41:58.316 --> 00:41:59.417 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:41:59.417 --> 00:42:01.452 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing is nobody laughed

00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:04.222 align:middle line:84%
when he would tell a person,
"Go to your local chemist

00:42:04.222 --> 00:42:07.325 align:middle line:84%
and behind the bottle, there
will be an old dusty bottle

00:42:07.325 --> 00:42:08.893 align:middle line:84%
that says this on
it, have it find it,

00:42:08.893 --> 00:42:10.461 align:middle line:84%
it's on the right
hand side of the--

00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:11.262 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:12.463 align:middle line:90%
>> -- second to top shelf."

00:42:12.463 --> 00:42:14.265 align:middle line:84%
Nobody denied that he was
accurate on all of that.

00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:15.299 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, amazing
healing gift, yeah.

00:42:15.299 --> 00:42:16.367 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:18.336 align:middle line:84%
But to go any further
than our own frame

00:42:18.336 --> 00:42:20.171 align:middle line:90%
of reference was denied.

00:42:20.171 --> 00:42:21.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:42:21.305 --> 00:42:25.109 align:middle line:84%
No, I think this is the
future of archeology--

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.943 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:42:25.943 --> 00:42:27.311 align:middle line:90%
>> -- and actually of science.

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:30.281 align:middle line:84%
Science needs to transcend the
materialist reference frame

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:35.453 align:middle line:84%
because more and more
holes are appearing in it

00:42:35.453 --> 00:42:37.321 align:middle line:84%
and they're very,
very troubling.

00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:39.357 align:middle line:90%
You know, for a long time,

00:42:39.357 --> 00:42:44.161 align:middle line:84%
we had the Ptolemaic
reference frame.

00:42:44.161 --> 00:42:47.098 align:middle line:90%
In Ptolemaic astronomy,

00:42:47.098 --> 00:42:50.601 align:middle line:84%
the earth was the
center of everything.

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:53.838 align:middle line:84%
And it was thought that the
sun revolved around the earth,

00:42:53.838 --> 00:42:55.940 align:middle line:84%
and the stars revolved
around the earth,

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.109 align:middle line:84%
and the planets revolved around
the earth, everything was

00:42:58.109 --> 00:43:00.111 align:middle line:84%
in the center-- the
earth was in the center,

00:43:00.111 --> 00:43:03.648 align:middle line:84%
and the earth stayed still,
the earth did not move.

00:43:03.648 --> 00:43:05.116 align:middle line:84%
This was the Ptolemaic
reference frame.

00:43:05.116 --> 00:43:08.286 align:middle line:84%
And the Ptolemaic reference
frame dominated early science

00:43:08.286 --> 00:43:10.621 align:middle line:84%
for a very long time,
you know, from the time

00:43:10.621 --> 00:43:13.758 align:middle line:84%
of the library of-- when Ptolemy
himself worked in the Library

00:43:13.758 --> 00:43:18.229 align:middle line:84%
of Alexandria right through
until the 16th century.

00:43:18.229 --> 00:43:22.366 align:middle line:84%
And gradually, as new-- even
later than the 16th century.

00:43:22.366 --> 00:43:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Gradually as new evidence
began to come into place,

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.573 align:middle line:84%
it was troubling-- the
evidence was troubling

00:43:28.573 --> 00:43:31.142 align:middle line:84%
for the earth-centered
reference frame.

00:43:31.142 --> 00:43:33.411 align:middle line:84%
And what the scientist at that
time would do was they would

00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:36.647 align:middle line:84%
invent patches and
fixes, so-called epicycles

00:43:36.647 --> 00:43:38.849 align:middle line:84%
which explained the
way the new evidence.

00:43:38.849 --> 00:43:42.687 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if you opposed
the Ptolemaic method,

00:43:42.687 --> 00:43:48.092 align:middle line:84%
if you dare to say that actually
the sun was at the center

00:43:48.092 --> 00:43:50.828 align:middle line:84%
and the earth revolved
around the sun,

00:43:50.828 --> 00:43:52.296 align:middle line:84%
you could get burnt
at the stake.

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:55.232 align:middle line:84%
And that's rather
like what we have now

00:43:55.232 --> 00:43:57.501 align:middle line:84%
with the materialist
reference frame in science.

00:43:57.501 --> 00:43:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Of course, people don't actually
get burnt at the stake to death.

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.172 align:middle line:84%
>> And they assassinate
your character.

00:44:01.172 --> 00:44:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>> But they assassinate
your character instead

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.276 align:middle line:90%
and destroy your career.

00:44:05.276 --> 00:44:07.778 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, for
example, a great scientist

00:44:07.778 --> 00:44:11.115 align:middle line:84%
like Rupert Sheldrake who
is bringing up evidence

00:44:11.115 --> 00:44:14.752 align:middle line:84%
which suggests that the
materialist reference frame may

00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:18.456 align:middle line:84%
be wrong is attacked so
viciously by his colleague.

00:44:18.456 --> 00:44:20.591 align:middle line:84%
>> But the evidence is
there, his experiment after--

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:23.594 align:middle line:84%
>> So for example-- for example,
if you are an arch materialist

00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:26.063 align:middle line:84%
and you believe that everything
is to be reduced to matter,

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:28.666 align:middle line:84%
you can't possibly
believe in telepathy.

00:44:28.666 --> 00:44:29.734 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:29.734 --> 00:44:30.368 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't possibly
accept telepathy.

00:44:30.368 --> 00:44:31.702 align:middle line:90%
But Richard has--

00:44:31.702 --> 00:44:34.472 align:middle line:84%
Rupert Sheldrake has brought
forward convincing evidence

00:44:34.472 --> 00:44:36.607 align:middle line:84%
that telepathy does exist,
scientific evidence done

00:44:36.607 --> 00:44:39.243 align:middle line:84%
on the basis of controlled
experiments.

00:44:39.243 --> 00:44:41.846 align:middle line:84%
Now what I'm saying is that
as this evidence mounts,

00:44:41.846 --> 00:44:44.849 align:middle line:84%
out of body experiences and near
death experiences are another

00:44:44.849 --> 00:44:46.183 align:middle line:90%
key element of this.

00:44:46.183 --> 00:44:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Because if you are having an
experience out of your body,

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:52.056 align:middle line:84%
then for sure your consciousness
is not generated by your brain.

00:44:52.056 --> 00:44:54.225 align:middle line:84%
It is not confined
to your brain.

00:44:54.225 --> 00:44:55.593 align:middle line:90%
It can step out of the brain.

00:44:55.593 --> 00:44:59.163 align:middle line:84%
If you can have experiences
after you are clinically dead

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:00.531 align:middle line:90%
and you are revived

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and resuscitation techniques
are getting better and better

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.336 align:middle line:84%
and you can come back and
report those experiences,

00:45:05.336 --> 00:45:08.506 align:middle line:84%
then that tells you that your
consciousness does not die

00:45:08.506 --> 00:45:09.840 align:middle line:90%
when your brain dies.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.409 align:middle line:84%
>> Raymond Moody has done
decades of work in this area.

00:45:11.409 --> 00:45:12.543 align:middle line:90%
>> Vast amounts of work.

00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:13.778 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is the
materialist scientist

00:45:13.778 --> 00:45:14.945 align:middle line:90%
desperately struggling

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:17.448 align:middle line:84%
to explain a way this
anomalous evidence

00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:20.151 align:middle line:84%
so that they can preserve
their cherished model.

00:45:20.151 --> 00:45:22.520 align:middle line:84%
But as the evidence mounts
and mounts and mounts

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.990 align:middle line:84%
and as the older generation of
materialist scientists passes

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:27.758 align:middle line:84%
on to experience
whatever they're going

00:45:27.758 --> 00:45:30.861 align:middle line:84%
to experience beyond the veil
and new generation is come in,

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:33.698 align:middle line:84%
I believe we will make the
shift and we will set aside

00:45:33.698 --> 00:45:36.167 align:middle line:84%
that reference frame and
say it served us once

00:45:36.167 --> 00:45:37.702 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't serve us anymore.

00:45:37.702 --> 00:45:38.803 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:38.803 --> 00:45:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And there are whole
new areas of inquiry

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:40.905 align:middle line:90%
that we need to get into.

00:45:40.905 --> 00:45:43.474 align:middle line:84%
And that may be mechanical
advantage is not the only way

00:45:43.474 --> 00:45:45.443 align:middle line:90%
to, you know, move objects.

00:45:45.443 --> 00:45:48.579 align:middle line:84%
And may be with the powers of
the mind can begin to be tapped

00:45:48.579 --> 00:45:51.782 align:middle line:84%
into again as I believe they
once were in the distant past.

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:53.951 align:middle line:90%
And may be consciousness free

00:45:53.951 --> 00:45:56.487 align:middle line:84%
of the body can be used
to explore the past.

00:45:56.487 --> 00:45:59.423 align:middle line:84%
>> And interestingly, I remember
reading a document recently.

00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:01.392 align:middle line:84%
It had to do-- it was
a black op source.

00:46:01.392 --> 00:46:03.861 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking about
a particular very advance

00:46:03.861 --> 00:46:06.497 align:middle line:84%
technology that's being
used behind the scenes

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:09.300 align:middle line:84%
in deep military
types of projects,

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.068 align:middle line:90%
usually for weaponization.

00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:15.039 align:middle line:84%
And they were speaking of how
they utilize various sites

00:46:15.039 --> 00:46:18.275 align:middle line:84%
and blogs to create
the disinformation

00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:20.711 align:middle line:84%
about the very thing
that they're working on.

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:21.812 align:middle line:90%
[Inaudible Remark]

00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:23.748 align:middle line:84%
So disinformation is
really a big part of it.

00:46:23.748 --> 00:46:24.949 align:middle line:90%
So it really--

00:46:24.949 --> 00:46:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, our society is
unfortunately pumped full

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:26.584 align:middle line:90%
of disinformation.

00:46:26.584 --> 00:46:27.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my God, yes.

00:46:27.785 --> 00:46:30.988 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's enormous
exercise of mind control.

00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:34.225 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I titled my
talk "The War on Consciousness"

00:46:34.225 --> 00:46:35.659 align:middle line:90%
because I believe that there--

00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:38.262 align:middle line:84%
that the vast resources
are being spent

00:46:38.262 --> 00:46:41.599 align:middle line:84%
on limiting the range
of human consciousness

00:46:41.599 --> 00:46:44.635 align:middle line:84%
and to keep us locked in a
particular narrow framework

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:47.104 align:middle line:84%
where we will be good
producers and consumers,

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:49.306 align:middle line:84%
and not ask any deeper
fundamental questions

00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:53.043 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of the reality
in which we find ourselves.

00:46:53.043 --> 00:46:55.212 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely, and this
runs across the board.

00:46:55.212 --> 00:46:56.413 align:middle line:90%
It runs through science.

00:46:56.413 --> 00:46:59.250 align:middle line:84%
It runs through all
areas of science

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.719 align:middle line:84%
and through medicine,
through education.

00:47:01.719 --> 00:47:05.189 align:middle line:84%
The disinformation to keep
people fairly much boxed

00:47:05.189 --> 00:47:07.625 align:middle line:84%
in as you say to
this very narrow view

00:47:07.625 --> 00:47:09.093 align:middle line:90%
of want their capabilities are--

00:47:09.093 --> 00:47:09.727 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:09.727 --> 00:47:10.361 align:middle line:90%
>> -- is the key.

00:47:10.361 --> 00:47:11.295 align:middle line:90%
>> It's they key.

00:47:11.295 --> 00:47:12.396 align:middle line:84%
>> We're not going
to look too far

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:13.664 align:middle line:84%
if we don't think we
are much to begin with.

00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:16.066 align:middle line:84%
>> And there is a war of
consciousness in our society.

00:47:16.066 --> 00:47:17.268 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, there is.

00:47:17.268 --> 00:47:18.269 align:middle line:84%
>> And, you know, the
sooner we wake up to that

00:47:18.269 --> 00:47:19.837 align:middle line:90%
and realize it, the better.

00:47:19.837 --> 00:47:21.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:24.074 align:middle line:84%
>> This is why, a point
I've made many times and I'd

00:47:24.074 --> 00:47:27.344 align:middle line:84%
like to make again now,
which is that the issue

00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:30.414 align:middle line:84%
of adults sovereignty
over consciousness,

00:47:30.414 --> 00:47:33.083 align:middle line:84%
I regard this is a
fundamental human right

00:47:33.083 --> 00:47:35.085 align:middle line:90%
and an unrecognized one.

00:47:35.085 --> 00:47:40.524 align:middle line:84%
That if, you know, I as an adult
cannot make sovereign choices

00:47:40.524 --> 00:47:42.927 align:middle line:84%
over what I wish to
experience or not experience

00:47:42.927 --> 00:47:44.495 align:middle line:90%
with my own consciousness.

00:47:44.495 --> 00:47:48.599 align:middle line:84%
If I in fact run the risk
of being sent to prison,

00:47:48.599 --> 00:47:52.236 align:middle line:84%
for example, for exploring my
own consciousness by using DMT,

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:55.906 align:middle line:84%
dimethyltryptamine, the active
ingredient of Ayahuasca.

00:47:55.906 --> 00:47:59.043 align:middle line:84%
If I live in a society that
does that, then I can't claim

00:47:59.043 --> 00:48:01.245 align:middle line:90%
to be free in any way whatsoever

00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:05.683 align:middle line:84%
because our consciousness is the
most intimate, the most sapient,

00:48:05.683 --> 00:48:10.087 align:middle line:84%
the most personal part of
ourselves, and I do not believe

00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:13.424 align:middle line:84%
that society can be healthy
when government claims

00:48:13.424 --> 00:48:15.726 align:middle line:84%
to hold the key to
our consciousness

00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:18.262 align:middle line:84%
and can tell us what we
may or may not experience.

00:48:18.262 --> 00:48:21.131 align:middle line:84%
So it allows us to
go off to a casino

00:48:21.131 --> 00:48:24.635 align:middle line:84%
and waste our hard-earned money
on gambling or it allows--

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:27.037 align:middle line:84%
>> And slam back a
dozen tequila shooters.

00:48:27.037 --> 00:48:29.006 align:middle line:84%
>> And slam back a
dozen tequila shooters.

00:48:29.006 --> 00:48:32.409 align:middle line:84%
Is it allows us to get blitzed
out of our minds on alcohol

00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:34.645 align:middle line:84%
because alcohol happens
to be a drug

00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:37.514 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't threaten
the existing order.

00:48:37.514 --> 00:48:41.752 align:middle line:84%
It allows pharmaceutical
companies to make billions

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:45.956 align:middle line:84%
of dollars investing in
consciousness-altering drugs

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:50.094 align:middle line:84%
like Ritalin or Seroxat
or Prozac because none

00:48:50.094 --> 00:48:55.099 align:middle line:84%
of these methods of altering
consciousness threaten the

00:48:55.099 --> 00:48:57.902 align:middle line:84%
fundamental basis of
those who run our society.

00:48:57.902 --> 00:48:59.536 align:middle line:90%
But those forms of consciousness

00:48:59.536 --> 00:49:02.840 align:middle line:84%
that do threaten it are
demonized and illegalized.

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:05.776 align:middle line:84%
And we are told that we as
adult can not make any choices.

00:49:05.776 --> 00:49:07.978 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they come up with
bogus reasons and they say,

00:49:07.978 --> 00:49:10.814 align:middle line:84%
"Well you-- you know,
you might harm others

00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:11.916 align:middle line:90%
in that state of consciousness."

00:49:11.916 --> 00:49:13.117 align:middle line:90%
Well I'm sorry.

00:49:13.117 --> 00:49:15.185 align:middle line:84%
We already have rules for
people who harm others

00:49:15.185 --> 00:49:18.489 align:middle line:84%
and they are very good rules
and I totally subscribe to them.

00:49:18.489 --> 00:49:20.491 align:middle line:84%
But we don't need
additional rules

00:49:20.491 --> 00:49:23.193 align:middle line:84%
that tell us what we can
experience and not experience

00:49:23.193 --> 00:49:26.230 align:middle line:84%
in the inner, private,
sacred sanctum

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:27.398 align:middle line:90%
of our own consciousness.

00:49:27.398 --> 00:49:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Hear, hear, and thank
you for saying that.

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.036 align:middle line:84%
And now, we have a
little bit of time left.

00:49:32.036 --> 00:49:34.705 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted-- you have two
projects that are under way.

00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:37.241 align:middle line:84%
You're booked for another--
it sounds like two years.

00:49:37.241 --> 00:49:38.642 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:40.911 align:middle line:84%
>> So I know I won't get to see
you again until this is done.

00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:43.247 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're revisiting
Fingerprints of the Gods

00:49:43.247 --> 00:49:45.516 align:middle line:84%
which I think was one
of my real eye-poppers--

00:49:45.516 --> 00:49:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:48.719 align:middle line:84%
>> -- in life to-- and
it was the Piri Reis Map

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:50.421 align:middle line:84%
that I think originally
got me thinking--

00:49:50.421 --> 00:49:51.522 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yeah.

00:49:51.522 --> 00:49:52.723 align:middle line:84%
>> -- - about things
totally different like.

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:55.225 align:middle line:84%
So what is the sequel to
Fingerprints of the Gods?

00:49:55.225 --> 00:49:56.327 align:middle line:84%
What are you adding
to this work?

00:49:56.327 --> 00:49:58.529 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm meaning to
publish that in 2015

00:49:58.529 --> 00:50:00.631 align:middle line:84%
which is actually 20
years after Fingerprints

00:50:00.631 --> 00:50:01.732 align:middle line:90%
of the Gods was first published.

00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:03.367 align:middle line:90%
It was first published in 1995.

00:50:03.367 --> 00:50:06.737 align:middle line:84%
But that's not why-- that's not
why that's not why I'm doing it.

00:50:06.737 --> 00:50:09.506 align:middle line:84%
Why I'm doing it is because
there's new evidence.

00:50:09.506 --> 00:50:10.741 align:middle line:90%
>> Would you share some of it?

00:50:10.741 --> 00:50:15.479 align:middle line:84%
>> And the case therefore
can be reopened.

00:50:15.479 --> 00:50:21.118 align:middle line:84%
Well, for example, an issue of
key importance in Fingerprints

00:50:21.118 --> 00:50:25.623 align:middle line:84%
of the Gods and the research
that I and others were doing

00:50:25.623 --> 00:50:28.993 align:middle line:84%
around that time was the
Great Sphinx, and the work

00:50:28.993 --> 00:50:30.127 align:middle line:90%
that John Anthony West

00:50:30.127 --> 00:50:32.329 align:middle line:84%
and Robert Schoch
brought before the public

00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:34.365 align:middle line:84%
that The Sphinx was exposed
to thousands of years

00:50:34.365 --> 00:50:37.368 align:middle line:84%
of heavy rainfall and that on
the basis of paleopathology,

00:50:37.368 --> 00:50:40.537 align:middle line:84%
the Sphinx might actually be
more than 12,000 years old.

00:50:40.537 --> 00:50:43.574 align:middle line:84%
Well that was dismissed at the
time by mainstream Egyptology

00:50:43.574 --> 00:50:45.876 align:middle line:84%
because they said,
"It can't possibly be

00:50:45.876 --> 00:50:48.012 align:middle line:84%
because there's no other
big monument in the world

00:50:48.012 --> 00:50:49.546 align:middle line:90%
which is 12,000 years old.

00:50:49.546 --> 00:50:50.881 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't just have one.

00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:51.949 align:middle line:90%
We must have others.

00:50:51.949 --> 00:50:54.118 align:middle line:84%
And so their evidence
must be mistaken."

00:50:54.118 --> 00:50:58.188 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have a sight now
called Gobekli Tepe in Turkey

00:50:58.188 --> 00:51:00.624 align:middle line:84%
which just isn't that
far from the Sphinx

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:03.694 align:middle line:84%
which is undoubtedly
12,000 years old

00:51:03.694 --> 00:51:05.195 align:middle line:84%
in which mainstream
archeology had

00:51:05.195 --> 00:51:07.197 align:middle line:90%
to accept it's 12,000 years old.

00:51:07.197 --> 00:51:10.367 align:middle line:84%
The reason they've had to accept
it's 12,000 years old is whoever

00:51:10.367 --> 00:51:13.904 align:middle line:84%
mysterious culture built
Gobekli Tepe 12,000 years ago

00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:16.373 align:middle line:84%
deliberately buried
it 2,000 years later.

00:51:16.373 --> 00:51:20.344 align:middle line:84%
So for 10,000 years, it's
been buried and not trampled

00:51:20.344 --> 00:51:22.913 align:middle line:84%
over by later cultures and
it's kept the record pristine

00:51:22.913 --> 00:51:24.815 align:middle line:84%
and clear and that idea
is 12,000 years old.

00:51:24.815 --> 00:51:26.216 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing artifacts.

00:51:26.216 --> 00:51:30.087 align:middle line:84%
>> And amazing artifacts and
an incredible achievement there

00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:32.156 align:middle line:84%
which couldn't just have
come out of nowhere.

00:51:32.156 --> 00:51:33.223 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:33.223 --> 00:51:34.458 align:middle line:84%
>> There has to be a
background to that.

00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:37.127 align:middle line:84%
If they're making 50 ton
megaliths 12,000 years ago,

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:40.364 align:middle line:84%
they practiced before that
probably for thousands of years.

00:51:40.364 --> 00:51:42.433 align:middle line:84%
So the heart-- suddenly
the whole idea

00:51:42.433 --> 00:51:45.736 align:middle line:84%
of a lost civilization
becomes credible again in a way

00:51:45.736 --> 00:51:46.970 align:middle line:84%
that it hasn't been
for a long time.

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:49.006 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, I know that we're
running out of time here

00:51:49.006 --> 00:51:53.010 align:middle line:84%
but the key-- another key piece
of evidence is I was not aware

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:54.878 align:middle line:84%
when I wrote Fingerprints
of the Gods.

00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:56.380 align:middle line:90%
I had some guess work

00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:59.483 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't sure what
the cataclysm was.

00:51:59.483 --> 00:52:02.052 align:middle line:84%
My whole thesis was that
a great civilization

00:52:02.052 --> 00:52:04.555 align:middle line:84%
of prehistoric antiquity
had been destroyed

00:52:04.555 --> 00:52:08.425 align:middle line:84%
in a global cataclysm somewhere
between 13,000 years ago

00:52:08.425 --> 00:52:12.329 align:middle line:84%
and 12,000 years ago, and
that there had been survivors

00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:16.733 align:middle line:84%
who had sort to pass down the
wisdom of their lost culture.

00:52:16.733 --> 00:52:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that it was connected
in some way with the end

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:20.971 align:middle line:90%
of the other last Ice Age.

00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:23.974 align:middle line:84%
But exactly what the cause
of it was wasn't clear.

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And I did look at the phenomenon
called Earth Crust Displacement

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:28.178 align:middle line:90%
that had been proposed

00:52:28.178 --> 00:52:30.914 align:middle line:84%
by Professor Charles
Hapgood some years before.

00:52:30.914 --> 00:52:32.316 align:middle line:90%
What's come out since--

00:52:32.316 --> 00:52:35.119 align:middle line:84%
long since Fingerprints of the
Gods was published in the 2000s,

00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:39.490 align:middle line:84%
in the last 10 years, is the
evidence that the earth was hit

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:42.059 align:middle line:90%
by a gigantic fragmenting comet.

00:52:42.059 --> 00:52:45.362 align:middle line:84%
And that that comet actually
hit North America and Canada,

00:52:45.362 --> 00:52:48.632 align:middle line:84%
and the Carolina Bays are
thought to be impact craters

00:52:48.632 --> 00:52:52.469 align:middle line:84%
of the fragments of that comet,
put on huge plummet of dust

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:56.707 align:middle line:84%
up into the atmosphere and
created a kind of global winter

00:52:56.707 --> 00:52:58.242 align:middle line:84%
which lasted for
a thousand years.

00:52:58.242 --> 00:53:01.311 align:middle line:84%
It's known as the
Younger Dryas in geology.

00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:02.579 align:middle line:90%
It's a mystery.

00:53:02.579 --> 00:53:04.181 align:middle line:84%
The earth was coming out
of the end of the Ice Age

00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:07.084 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly it went back into
a thousand year deep freeze.

00:53:07.084 --> 00:53:09.686 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of animal
species went extinct.

00:53:09.686 --> 00:53:11.221 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors passed
through that.

00:53:11.221 --> 00:53:14.391 align:middle line:84%
And that cometry impact
which came close to

00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:17.127 align:middle line:84%
but was not quite an
extinction level event,

00:53:17.127 --> 00:53:20.764 align:middle line:84%
that cometry impact I believe
was the cataclysm that wiped

00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:23.767 align:middle line:84%
out a whole human
civilization from our memory

00:53:23.767 --> 00:53:26.236 align:middle line:84%
and made us a species
with amnesia.

00:53:26.236 --> 00:53:28.105 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much
more new evidence

00:53:28.105 --> 00:53:29.173 align:middle line:90%
which I'll be looking at.

00:53:29.173 --> 00:53:30.274 align:middle line:84%
>> So much evidence
toward that as well.

00:53:30.274 --> 00:53:31.575 align:middle line:84%
>> Evidence from the
Amazon Jungle as well.

00:53:31.575 --> 00:53:34.511 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Amazon Jungle,
one of the horrible things

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:36.446 align:middle line:84%
that are happening in the
Amazon is the clearances

00:53:36.446 --> 00:53:37.648 align:middle line:84%
of the rain forest
that's happening now.

00:53:37.648 --> 00:53:38.982 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:38.982 --> 00:53:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>> But in those clearances
are being exposed the remains

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:43.120 align:middle line:84%
of gigantic cities and huge
earthquakes and stone circles.

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.154 align:middle line:90%
So, the Amazon--

00:53:44.154 --> 00:53:45.155 align:middle line:90%
>> And giants.

00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And-- well, that's
another thing.

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:49.259 align:middle line:84%
>> And giants, where did
they came-- come from?

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:50.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Who knows?

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.061 align:middle line:90%
>> Giants and pygmies and--

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:53.297 align:middle line:90%
>> Giants perhaps of intellect.

00:53:53.297 --> 00:53:54.631 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:58.068 align:middle line:84%
And one of the artifacts from
Gobekli Tepe that I found

00:53:58.068 --> 00:54:00.270 align:middle line:84%
so interesting, I was talking
with Linda Moulton Howe

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:03.740 align:middle line:84%
about it a while back, was
one of the statues that looks

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.109 align:middle line:84%
to be someone from a
completely different--

00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:07.544 align:middle line:84%
you could say an
off planet culture--

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:08.478 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes.

00:54:08.478 --> 00:54:09.546 align:middle line:84%
>> -- with sophisticated
clothing.

00:54:09.546 --> 00:54:10.514 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it
is but I found it--

00:54:10.514 --> 00:54:11.215 align:middle line:84%
>> [Inaudible] that,
the mystery is--

00:54:11.215 --> 00:54:12.149 align:middle line:90%
>> found it intriguing.

00:54:12.149 --> 00:54:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>> -- deep enough on that.

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:14.484 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay, the mystery
is deep enough.

00:54:14.484 --> 00:54:16.887 align:middle line:84%
Okay, and finally, we just
have a minute or so left.

00:54:16.887 --> 00:54:20.190 align:middle line:84%
War God, now you're going
back in revisiting--

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:20.757 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:21.191 align:middle line:90%
>> -- the event.

00:54:21.191 --> 00:54:22.392 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:23.327 align:middle line:84%
>> The events of the
Spanish Conquest of Mexico.

00:54:23.327 --> 00:54:24.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:24.595 --> 00:54:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>> An extraordinary story
that changed human history

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:29.099 align:middle line:84%
that created the
world we know today.

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:33.537 align:middle line:84%
The encounter between the
Spanish and the Native America,

00:54:33.537 --> 00:54:38.175 align:middle line:84%
Meshika people who we call
the Aztecs, 490 Spaniards turn

00:54:38.175 --> 00:54:41.778 align:middle line:84%
up on the coast of Mexico
and somehow extraordinarily,

00:54:41.778 --> 00:54:45.816 align:middle line:84%
unbelievably defeat
Aztec culture,

00:54:45.816 --> 00:54:50.554 align:middle line:84%
destroy a standing
army of 200,000 men.

00:54:50.554 --> 00:54:54.891 align:middle line:84%
And when I wrote this novel,
it really is a turning point

00:54:54.891 --> 00:54:57.761 align:middle line:84%
in human history because
20, 30 years later,

00:54:57.761 --> 00:55:00.831 align:middle line:84%
the Spanish Conquest of Peru
followed exactly the same model

00:55:00.831 --> 00:55:02.733 align:middle line:84%
as the Spanish Conquest
of Mexico.

00:55:02.733 --> 00:55:06.103 align:middle line:84%
And it set the process,
the poisonous toxic process

00:55:06.103 --> 00:55:09.473 align:middle line:84%
of colonialism and slavery that
dominated the world for many,

00:55:09.473 --> 00:55:11.141 align:middle line:90%
many years after that.

00:55:11.141 --> 00:55:15.412 align:middle line:84%
So when Moctezuma confronted
the Spanish landing in Mexico,

00:55:15.412 --> 00:55:18.882 align:middle line:84%
a great burden of responsibility
lay upon his shoulders.

00:55:18.882 --> 00:55:21.918 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
Moctezuma was a man

00:55:21.918 --> 00:55:24.221 align:middle line:84%
who is deeply steeped
and evil himself.

00:55:24.221 --> 00:55:29.726 align:middle line:84%
The Spanish were evil and wicked
and cruel, a viscous race,

00:55:29.726 --> 00:55:33.764 align:middle line:84%
and the-- unfortunately,
the Aztecs were drown

00:55:33.764 --> 00:55:35.866 align:middle line:84%
into human sacrifice
and they were--

00:55:35.866 --> 00:55:40.237 align:middle line:84%
when the Great Pyramid of
Tenochtitlan was inaugurated,

00:55:40.237 --> 00:55:44.274 align:middle line:84%
it's said that 80,000
people were sacrificed,

00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:46.510 align:middle line:84%
their hearts were cut
out to inaugurate that.

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:47.277 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:47.277 --> 00:55:48.278 align:middle line:90%
>> And what I looked at--

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:49.246 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have a
delusional characters

00:55:49.246 --> 00:55:51.048 align:middle line:84%
on both sides being
operated from--

00:55:51.048 --> 00:55:55.118 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what interested me is
that Moctezuma believed himself

00:55:55.118 --> 00:55:58.722 align:middle line:84%
to be in contact with the
war god of the Aztecs,

00:55:58.722 --> 00:56:02.192 align:middle line:84%
Huitzilopochtli, and Cortes
believed himself to be

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:04.394 align:middle line:90%
in contact with St. Peter.

00:56:04.394 --> 00:56:07.731 align:middle line:84%
And both of them were
driven by these contacts

00:56:07.731 --> 00:56:09.766 align:middle line:84%
to do demonic and
terrible things.

00:56:09.766 --> 00:56:12.169 align:middle line:84%
And so-- I mean giving
away a bit of the plot.

00:56:12.169 --> 00:56:16.940 align:middle line:84%
The fundamental pieces of
the story is that the entity,

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.042 align:middle line:84%
the demonic entity that
appeared to Moctezuma

00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:22.713 align:middle line:84%
as the war god was the same
entity that appeared to Cortes

00:56:22.713 --> 00:56:26.650 align:middle line:84%
as St. Peter, and drove
both these man to madness

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:29.886 align:middle line:84%
and to plunge the whole
region into an episode

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:32.789 align:middle line:84%
that has shaped human history
for the worst ever since.

00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:36.593 align:middle line:84%
And I have two heroines
in the story.

00:56:36.593 --> 00:56:37.994 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:56:37.994 --> 00:56:42.065 align:middle line:84%
>> Tozi and Malinal, because the
feminine is most important issue

00:56:42.065 --> 00:56:43.467 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:56:43.467 --> 00:56:47.337 align:middle line:84%
And we meet them in the opening
chapters in the fattening pens

00:56:47.337 --> 00:56:51.475 align:middle line:84%
in Tenochtitlan because that's
the old name of Mexico City,

00:56:51.475 --> 00:56:53.009 align:middle line:90%
that was the Aztec capital.

00:56:53.009 --> 00:56:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Because before the Aztec
sacrificed their victims,

00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.416 align:middle line:84%
they first fattened them so
that they would be pleasing

00:56:59.416 --> 00:57:00.751 align:middle line:90%
to the gods.

00:57:00.751 --> 00:57:05.455 align:middle line:84%
And these two young women
escaped in a dramatic episode

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:06.790 align:middle line:90%
from the fattening pens.

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:10.694 align:middle line:84%
And one of them, Malinal, who
is a historical character,

00:57:10.694 --> 00:57:12.896 align:middle line:84%
goes to the coast
and encounters Cortes

00:57:12.896 --> 00:57:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and becomes his interpreter,
his mistress.

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:20.604 align:middle line:84%
And he said later, aside from
god himself, it was Malinal

00:57:20.604 --> 00:57:24.107 align:middle line:84%
who gave me this conquest of
Mexico because she was able

00:57:24.107 --> 00:57:27.244 align:middle line:84%
to tell him about the
Myth of Quetzalcoatl,

00:57:27.244 --> 00:57:28.645 align:middle line:84%
the return of the
feathered serpent.

00:57:28.645 --> 00:57:31.081 align:middle line:84%
>> And that gets into the
year you established the story

00:57:31.081 --> 00:57:32.449 align:middle line:90%
at the end.

00:57:32.449 --> 00:57:34.251 align:middle line:84%
>> And the story-- it so happens
that in the Aztec calendar,

00:57:34.251 --> 00:57:38.021 align:middle line:84%
Quetzalcoatl was expected to
return in the Year One Reed.

00:57:38.021 --> 00:57:42.592 align:middle line:84%
And 1519 was the Year One Reed,
the year that Cortes turned

00:57:42.592 --> 00:57:43.894 align:middle line:90%
up on the coast of Mexico.

00:57:43.894 --> 00:57:48.698 align:middle line:84%
And he exploited this myth
to an extraordinary degree.

00:57:48.698 --> 00:57:51.768 align:middle line:84%
He was a machiavellian player,
a machiavellian character

00:57:51.768 --> 00:57:55.138 align:middle line:84%
and he dominated Moctezuma
psychologically long before he

00:57:55.138 --> 00:58:00.577 align:middle line:84%
met him on the battle field
because he had this knowledge.

00:58:00.577 --> 00:58:06.349 align:middle line:84%
But I tried to show in my book
that in the darkest of times,

00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:09.085 align:middle line:84%
there are wonderful
qualities of the human beings.

00:58:09.085 --> 00:58:09.986 align:middle line:90%
>> On both sides.

00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:11.421 align:middle line:90%
>> On both sides that survive.

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:12.489 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:12.489 --> 00:58:13.323 align:middle line:84%
>> And there are good
Spanish characters

00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:15.659 align:middle line:90%
and good Aztec characters too.

00:58:15.659 --> 00:58:16.693 align:middle line:90%
And at the heart of it,

00:58:16.693 --> 00:58:18.662 align:middle line:84%
these two courageous
young women caught

00:58:18.662 --> 00:58:20.564 align:middle line:84%
up in an extraordinary
adventure.

00:58:20.564 --> 00:58:21.998 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds like
a riveting read.

00:58:21.998 --> 00:58:25.669 align:middle line:84%
However, American publishers
are still wanting more

00:58:25.669 --> 00:58:27.637 align:middle line:90%
of the Graham Hancock's work.

00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:29.439 align:middle line:84%
And so, if you want
to buy it right now,

00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:30.874 align:middle line:90%
we have to go to amazon.co.uk.

00:58:30.874 --> 00:58:32.642 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it has to be Amazon UK.

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:33.844 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:58:33.844 --> 00:58:35.879 align:middle line:84%
>> Or go to my website and
then there's a whole War

00:58:35.879 --> 00:58:36.413 align:middle line:90%
God section--

00:58:36.413 --> 00:58:37.647 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:58:37.647 --> 00:58:38.949 align:middle line:84%
>> -- on my website and
free chapters to read online

00:58:38.949 --> 00:58:40.250 align:middle line:84%
so people can make
up their own mind

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:42.052 align:middle line:84%
if they're interested
in the story or not.

00:58:42.052 --> 00:58:45.155 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, go the
extra mile and open an account

00:58:45.155 --> 00:58:47.290 align:middle line:84%
with Amazon UK and
you can get it there.

00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:49.259 align:middle line:84%
American publishers
will go for this book

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:51.061 align:middle line:90%
if they succeed in Britain.

00:58:51.061 --> 00:58:52.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Well there are a lot of
things we can't get here.

00:58:52.562 --> 00:58:55.732 align:middle line:84%
I use amazon.co.uk all
the time especially

00:58:55.732 --> 00:58:57.167 align:middle line:84%
for a really good
esoteric works.

00:58:57.167 --> 00:58:58.401 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:58.401 --> 00:59:00.203 align:middle line:84%
>> I have one final question
then we are out of time.

00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:01.771 align:middle line:84%
Graham, you've experienced
so much.

00:59:01.771 --> 00:59:02.939 align:middle line:90%
You've been a journey.

00:59:02.939 --> 00:59:06.476 align:middle line:84%
What is the most
profoundly surprising thing

00:59:06.476 --> 00:59:09.446 align:middle line:84%
that you've probably stumbled
across in the last 40 years

00:59:09.446 --> 00:59:10.714 align:middle line:90%
or so of your journey?

00:59:10.714 --> 00:59:15.018 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I have to say, for
sure, it's the experience

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:18.922 align:middle line:84%
of seamlessly convincing
parallel realms

00:59:18.922 --> 00:59:22.292 align:middle line:84%
that I have encountered
through my work with Ayahuasca,

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:25.795 align:middle line:84%
I've now have more than
50 session with Ayahuasca

00:59:25.795 --> 00:59:30.166 align:middle line:84%
and the direct experience of
an encounter with a powerful,

00:59:30.166 --> 00:59:36.206 align:middle line:84%
loving mother goddess figure
in the form of Mother Ayahuasca

00:59:36.206 --> 00:59:39.876 align:middle line:84%
who has healed me in the
profoundness of ways,

00:59:39.876 --> 00:59:42.145 align:middle line:84%
and has opened up
creative gifts in me

00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:44.514 align:middle line:90%
that I did not even know I had.

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:47.050 align:middle line:90%
That is the most surprising

00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:51.087 align:middle line:84%
and the most extraordinary
experience of my life.

00:59:54.658 --> 00:59:57.093 align:middle line:84%
of your time before you jet
off to the airport and back

to Europe and I hope
