>> PAUL MILLS: I close my
eyes to do a contemplative

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.840 align:middle line:84%
meditation, and within a moment,
I found myself encountering

Been pretty much in
traditional biomedicine,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.890 align:middle line:84%
but I always kept the spiritual
side of me off the table.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.500 align:middle line:84%
I also knew there
were scientists who

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.490 align:middle line:90%
have active spiritual lives.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I set about
interviewing them.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed over 30
scientists for the book.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Mainly, biomedical scientists,
some physicists and others,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.560 align:middle line:84%
they share with me
their spiritual journey.

>> MILLS: Science should have
been by our side all these

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:90%
centuries.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.360 align:middle line:84%
But it's been mainly
an impediment,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:90%
but it's not too late.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk
about what you learned

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.270 align:middle line:84%
in your relationship with Deepak
and why you were drawn to do

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.192 align:middle line:90%

Finally, it looks like
science and scientists

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.760 align:middle line:10%
are beginning to
understand that there's

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.920 align:middle line:10%
a metaphysical realm after all.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Because we live in an age
of scientific materialism,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:84%
the average person won't
jump into metaphysics

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:90%
without some kind of proof.

Paul Mills is with us today to
talk about the spiritual life

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.010 align:middle line:90%
of many prominent scientists.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Toward the end of
telling the skeptics--

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.560 align:middle line:84%
you have a wonderful statement
about skepticism, by the way--

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.320 align:middle line:84%
the skeptics, you
can relax, it's

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.480 align:middle line:90%
OK to explore a little bit.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.560 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Paul.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.727 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Thank you, Regina.

00:01:26.727 --> 00:01:28.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.020 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: This
book that you wrote,

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.080 align:middle line:10%
all started with a
vision, a big vision.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And so let's go ahead
and talk about the vision

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.360 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll understand why
it was time to write the book.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.620 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Yeah.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.850 align:middle line:10%
Yes, some years ago,
there was an event here

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.860 align:middle line:10%
on Earth that's called
the Galactic Alignment,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.610 align:middle line:10%
and it's when our Solar
System and our Earth and Sun

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.460 align:middle line:10%
have moved into a certain
position in relationship

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.815 align:middle line:10%
to the Galactic Center.

00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:53.190 align:middle line:10%
And it's a position
where there's

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.680 align:middle line:10%
a kind of open line
to the Galactic Center

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.720 align:middle line:10%
that we usually don't have.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.060 align:middle line:10%
I learned about that
as a phenomenon.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.430 align:middle line:10%
And after learning
about it, I decided

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.320 align:middle line:10%
to do a meditation
because I wanted

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.690 align:middle line:10%
to understand the
phenomenon a little bit more

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.410 align:middle line:10%
than I had read.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I close my eyes to do a
contemplative meditation

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.950 align:middle line:84%
on this activity,
and within a moment,

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.280 align:middle line:84%
I found myself encountering
a vast, vast being,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.980 align:middle line:84%
a consciousness that was
totally foreign to anything

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.960 align:middle line:90%
I had ever encountered before.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Can you describe
a little bit of it to us just

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:90%
the nature of what you felt?

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: I felt in awe because
of the vastness of this being.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And then it began to communicate
with me telepathically.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
it told me was it

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.800 align:middle line:84%
has no interest in human beings,
which was very odd to me.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
But then it followed it
up immediately by saying,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.470 align:middle line:84%
"but I have a great
interest in humanity."

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And it told me that
it had been following

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.930 align:middle line:84%
the development and progress
of humanity for eons.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Eons and eons.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And that one day, humanity
will fulfill the reason

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.230 align:middle line:90%
it was created.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And as it shared
that with me, it

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:84%
showed me an image of
the Earth from space.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's beautiful,
really beautiful image.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked at
it, it showed me

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:84%
this golden,
whitish-colored light that

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.220 align:middle line:90%
slowly spread around the globe.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And it said, "the creation
of that light, that energy,

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.880 align:middle line:84%
is the reason
human beings exist,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.190 align:middle line:90%
why we're on the planet."

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.553 align:middle line:84%
And as I began to
ponder, what was it?

00:03:30.553 --> 00:03:32.720 align:middle line:84%
What is it that we're going
to create in the future?

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Then the information
was, was love.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Humanity's role on the Earth is
to bring into this dimension,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.010 align:middle line:84%
we commonly call
the third dimension,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:84%
love in manifestation,
in a concrete form,

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.320 align:middle line:90%
that's what I was shown.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And after that vision,
I began to wonder, well,

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.940 align:middle line:84%
what have I been
doing as a scientist?

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Am I helping this phenomenon
to occur in the future?

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.990 align:middle line:90%
Am I hindering it?

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Then I began to wonder, well,
what about science in general?

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, I knew science is mainly
materialistic and, therefore,

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.720 align:middle line:84%
not really helping
things along too much.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Not in this area.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: No.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.530 align:middle line:84%
But I also knew there
were scientists who

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.490 align:middle line:90%
have active spiritual lives.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I set about
interviewing them.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.589 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed over 30
scientists for the book,

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.339 align:middle line:84%
mainly biomedical scientists,
some physicists, and others.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:84%
They share with me
their spiritual journey,

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
transpersonal experiences,
mystical experiences,

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.660 align:middle line:90%
metaphysical experiences.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Most of which
they keep from public view.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: The vast majority
of scientists do for, perhaps,

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.610 align:middle line:90%
obvious reasons.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's--

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, returning.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.597 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally, things
haven't changed much

00:04:38.597 --> 00:04:39.770 align:middle line:90%
since the Inquisition.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.920 align:middle line:90%
In fact, a lot of people stay--

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Jan Engels-Smith, for
example, a psychiatrist who

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:84%
also deals now a lot with
the shamanic realms and such,

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.780 align:middle line:84%
says one of the most
prominent imprints

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.993 align:middle line:84%
right now in the
more astral field

00:04:57.993 --> 00:04:59.660 align:middle line:84%
that people are moving
through and still

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.380 align:middle line:84%
affect human beings has to
do with the leftover imprint

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.210 align:middle line:90%
of the days of the Inquisition.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And that many, many of
these beings and scientists

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and healers and artists
are back and afraid

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:90%
to represent their truth.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: Yeah, that makes
a lot of sense to me.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.730 align:middle line:84%
That underlying imprint
from the subconscious level,

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and then of course on
the conscious level,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.830 align:middle line:84%
most scientists who are at least
in the academic realm value

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:25.770 align:middle line:90%
their reputation.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.290 align:middle line:90%
Reputation is everything.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: And if you start
deviating off into certain

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.060 align:middle line:84%
areas, it can hurt just a
little bit your reputation.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.860 align:middle line:90%
And that--

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.765 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which affects grants
and tenure and everything.

00:05:36.765 --> 00:05:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Absolutely.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tell us a little
bit about your own scientific

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.830 align:middle line:90%
background.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.673 align:middle line:84%
We'll just go through
you kind of quickly

00:05:41.673 --> 00:05:43.340 align:middle line:84%
so we can get to the
meat of what you're

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.550 align:middle line:90%
trying to share here today.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Sure.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, I ended up in
science because I

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:84%
had a metaphysical
experience when

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.982 align:middle line:84%
I was a young boy in
high school, actually.

00:05:51.982 --> 00:05:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What was it?

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: It was an out-of-body
experience when I was

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:90%
meditating.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And I had learned
transcendental meditation

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.400 align:middle line:84%
a few months earlier, sat down
under an oak tree to meditate,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.210 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Boom.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: --bam, I'm out
of my body, looking down.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.130 align:middle line:90%
It was initially startling.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I had never heard
of such a thing.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.250 align:middle line:90%
I was raised Catholic.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.090 align:middle line:84%
There was no discussion of
expanding consciousness at all.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.230 align:middle line:84%
But I settled into
it very quickly.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And what I noticed
was there was me,

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Paul that I knew myself to be,
having the experience but also

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.170 align:middle line:90%
a much larger me.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.100 align:middle line:84%
A larger me that was extremely
comfortable with the situation.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.100 align:middle line:90%
It was familiar.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.020 align:middle line:90%
It was peaceful.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.510 align:middle line:84%
After I returned to
my body, so to speak,

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.470 align:middle line:84%
I began to wonder,
well, who am I?

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Am I this Paul?

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:90%
Am I that Paul?

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.490 align:middle line:84%
What is my potential
as a human being?

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And that really led me
certainly into esoteric

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.710 align:middle line:84%
studies, primarily Vedanta
but also to pursue science.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Because I figured, well,
science can get me there.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.680 align:middle line:90%
It has the answers.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.055 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Talk to us about
then a little bit in science.

00:06:52.055 --> 00:06:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: My area in science
has been primarily biomedical,

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.360 align:middle line:84%
behavioral medicine,
integrative medicine, oncology.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm very collaborative
interdisciplinary,

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and been pretty much in
traditional biomedicine

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.380 align:middle line:84%
but I always kept the spiritual
side of me off the table.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.680 align:middle line:84%
We said a moment ago,
most scientists do.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:84%
But in the last
handful of years,

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:90%
I began to let that change.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And now, of course, it's
all out in the book.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and just to backtrack
for a moment, what you said

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.680 align:middle line:84%
is that this being, which is
often the case with guides

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.970 align:middle line:90%
of a particular--

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.580 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.770 align:middle line:84%
from particular
realms, shall we say--

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say stature
or hierarchy-- it's really not

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.340 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:90%
That's not how it works.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.750 align:middle line:84%
But certain level
of guides really

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.070 align:middle line:84%
aren't interested so much in the
individuated stuff, the drama,

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:84%
and everything that each
human is going through.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:53.360 align:middle line:84%
It's entertainment almost
more than anything.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's not even entertaining.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.270 align:middle line:84%
But I understand what
you're talking about,

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.310 align:middle line:84%
about the collective of
what humanity is, which

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.580 align:middle line:84%
I have great respect
for what humanity is,

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.580 align:middle line:84%
how they've been treated,
and what humanity can become.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'm totally with you
on this and the notion

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.440 align:middle line:84%
that we're capable of
something that isn't really

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:84%
even accessible in
some other places.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.030 align:middle line:84%
In some other-- on some other
planets and realms, it's not--

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.450 align:middle line:84%
love is not the
directive per se.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: No.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And I want to add that last
month, I was reading a book.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a series of lectures
by Rudolf Steiner.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, I
love Rudolf Steiner.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:34.049 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: [LAUGHS]

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I know we both share
an appreciation for Waldorf.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: We did.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And Steiner, yeah.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Yeah.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.289 align:middle line:84%
This was a series
of lectures he gave

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:42.090 align:middle line:90%
on the Gospel of Saint John.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, I read a
section where he described,

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.330 align:middle line:84%
the mission of the
Earth is to bring love

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.100 align:middle line:84%
into the cosmos, which is
a beautiful confirmation.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And he also said, it's
up to us as humanity

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:57.080 align:middle line:90%
for that to succeed.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not the Earth
or self doing,

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.722 align:middle line:84%
it's us being here in
relationship with Earth.

00:09:00.722 --> 00:09:01.805 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: She's already--

00:09:01.805 --> 00:09:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: She's doing it.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.457 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --doing it.

00:09:03.457 --> 00:09:05.840 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us to come into
resonance with the Earth

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.270 align:middle line:90%
and what she already gives us.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.800 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.660 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And once I read an esoteric
document by Saint John

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.230 align:middle line:84%
on the subject of
armageddon that

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:27.960 align:middle line:84%
was at once terrifying in its
description, and so beautiful

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.230 align:middle line:84%
in the elevation of
what it was saying

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:34.400 align:middle line:84%
happens at that time, what
happens in this transition time

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.390 align:middle line:90%
by way of love.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's all love that fuels
where we go as a species.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And so brilliant,
brilliant being.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So now in your own background,
just a little bit before we

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:84%
go into some of the people
because we've already

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
told people we're going to talk
about some of the scientists

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:84%
and what they came across
in their own lives.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.350 align:middle line:84%
You worked with Deepak
Chopra for quite a long time.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how your
relationship-- what you learned

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.790 align:middle line:84%
in your relationship with
Deepak and why you were

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.110 align:middle line:90%
drawn to do that to begin with?

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Yeah.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Meeting Deepak was very, very
helpful for me, my career.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, meeting
him was the reason

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:17.810 align:middle line:84%
I could eventually start tapping
into consciousness studies.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.105 align:middle line:84%
He and I had a meeting,
a chance meeting

00:10:20.105 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:90%
at a scientific conference.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.450 align:middle line:84%
We started speaking about
integrative medicine which

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.300 align:middle line:84%
is an area I was doing
research in at the time.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.390 align:middle line:84%
We both started lamenting
that integrative medicine

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and integrative
medicine research

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:84%
is not at all
really integrative.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.690 align:middle line:84%
The vision is for that,
but it's still fragmented.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:39.050 align:middle line:84%
It's still reductionistic
as is the biomedical model.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So we decided we
needed to conduct

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.190 align:middle line:84%
research that was
truly integrative,

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.780 align:middle line:90%
whole person, which we did.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.400 align:middle line:84%
We designed a
beautiful study called

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.610 align:middle line:84%
the self-directed biological
transformation initiative,

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:84%
which was on a whole
person medical system,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.090 align:middle line:90%
ayurveda in this case.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda, as you know,
in Tibetan medicine,

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.680 align:middle line:84%
all the traditional
systems understand

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.840 align:middle line:84%
the transcendental nature
of the human being,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.320 align:middle line:90%
consciousness itself.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.830 align:middle line:84%
So doing that research
study and others we did

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:84%
led me naturally to begin
to discuss the transcendent

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:84%
in the context of our scientific
publications, journals,

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.280 align:middle line:90%
talks at conferences.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And that led me to
say, I just need

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:84%
to start speaking about this,
my own personal experience,

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.430 align:middle line:84%
I'll highlight other scientists
who have had such experiences,

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and who have been in
the closet, so to speak.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And this gets back to
the vision of love.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.570 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what has
science been doing for us?

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, as you know,
it's been a hindrance.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It has
been a hindrance.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Most people--

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It ridicules
those who speak that way.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Yeah.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Most people look to
science for answers,

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and we have Western
science, particularly

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.170 align:middle line:84%
materialism aspect,
who basically

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.380 align:middle line:84%
say there's no mystical,
there's no metaphysical.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.690 align:middle line:84%
So people then believe that and
say, OK, well, there isn't any.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:52.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to--

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:53.660 align:middle line:90%
I'll do something else here.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.030 align:middle line:84%
I'll follow some
other trajectory

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and I won't have
the encouragement

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:59.880 align:middle line:90%
to develop it myself.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.040 align:middle line:90%
So it's been an impediment.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.210 align:middle line:84%
I want to see science evolve
out of materialism just

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.000 align:middle line:84%
like we as human beings need
to evolve out of our egotism

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:84%
to get us to the next step.
if science does that, great.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.370 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't please
get out of the way.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
get out of the way.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: And let's unfold
this as we need it to be,

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.020 align:middle line:90%
and now is the time.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, we're at such
a kind of critical juncture

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:31.010 align:middle line:84%
in this, as you say, ability to
understand, feel, and propagate

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:33.290 align:middle line:84%
love in all its
forms in the most

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:34.940 align:middle line:90%
simple and sweetest levels.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.700 align:middle line:84%
People think, oh my
god, how are we going

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:90%
to have a planet based on love?

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.415 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I was
meditating recently--

00:12:41.415 --> 00:12:43.040 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't meditating,
I was sitting down

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:84%
to read a book and
all of a sudden,

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:84%
I got that funny
feeling, I thought,

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:84%
oops, there's someone
who wants to talk to me.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So I closed my eyes and I
actually got my cell phone

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.810 align:middle line:84%
and thought, it feels
like something I

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.708 align:middle line:90%
need to probably write down.

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I just recorded
it on my cell phone.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out it was
really an ode to love,

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and every way in
which people can love.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And that this whole notion of
bringing love onto this planet

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:11.220 align:middle line:90%
is not a heroic effort at all.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:84%
It's just taking a
moment to feel uplifted,

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.700 align:middle line:84%
to feel an appreciation
for another person,

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.930 align:middle line:84%
for a little pet, for
nature, for a piece of music.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.060 align:middle line:84%
All of that is a
reflection of love.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And if every person would
give themselves permission

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and understand the
necessity and maybe really

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:37.340 align:middle line:84%
the directive for us to take
those moments and feel this,

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.260 align:middle line:90%
it starts.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.457 align:middle line:90%
It just starts.

00:13:40.457 --> 00:13:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: It does because
it's all in there.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.050 align:middle line:84%
You just need permission
and somewhat of a setting.

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: And then it begins.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:48.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It does,
and it starts in mass.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:84%
The more people that can
embrace simple, simple practices

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:56.030 align:middle line:84%
like this, like gratitude, which
is just love and appreciation,

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.710 align:middle line:90%
it's just love.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.610 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why people like
gratitude meditation so much.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: It's powerful.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's very powerful.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: It overcomes
duality and separation.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It really does.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.500 align:middle line:84%
So now when we're getting
down to these scientists,

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:15.000 align:middle line:84%
their spirit and their mind,
and how do they work with that?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: So most of the
scientists I interviewed had--

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:84%
well, some had a kind of
a transpersonal spiritual

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.630 align:middle line:84%
awakening while they
were already scientists,

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and I'll mention
one now in terms

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:84%
of gratitude and compassion
since we were just

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.000 align:middle line:90%
speaking about that.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Some had more psychic spiritual
capabilities as young children,

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.840 align:middle line:84%
and that led them to
become scientists.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right,
to figure out why.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: So one of the
scientists, for example,

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.110 align:middle line:84%
her name is Professor
Dusana Dorjee.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:43.543 align:middle line:90%
She's out of York University.

00:14:43.543 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
I like her story.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: And she was--

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:47.360 align:middle line:90%
it's a great story.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.090 align:middle line:84%
She was deep into Buddhist
meditation, compassion

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:84%
meditation, gratitude
meditation, and that

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.130 align:middle line:84%
led her eventually
into what's often

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.800 align:middle line:84%
called a non-dual state,
non-duality, non-dual

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.320 align:middle line:90%
awareness, essentially oneness.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.150 align:middle line:84%
That can be a challenging
state for people

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:middle line:84%
to first come into if
we're not prepared for it

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:84%
because it also has
to do with a changing

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.350 align:middle line:84%
of the sense of your
own individual identity

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.550 align:middle line:90%
as a person.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Much of that tends to go away.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.030 align:middle line:90%
She was struggling.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:18.020 align:middle line:84%
She was struggling with how
do I live life in this state?

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.000 align:middle line:84%
It turns out, she was
fortunate, she ended up

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:84%
having to go to a conference
shortly thereafter.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And at the conference, she
encountered a Buddhist monk.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And she asked the Buddhist
monk, can I speak with you?

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm struggling with something.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.490 align:middle line:84%
He said yes, they sat down,
she explained her practice

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and what happened and where
she was at that moment.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And he-- actually when
she shared that with him,

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
she just began to cry because
it had been such a load for her,

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.940 align:middle line:90%
trying to decide what to do.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.030 align:middle line:84%
He was very thoughtful and he
said, what you're experiencing,

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:54.010 align:middle line:84%
this is the normal trajectory
of spiritual development.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.060 align:middle line:90%
And you have a choice.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:00.540 align:middle line:84%
You can either go back and
accept the conditioned reality

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.500 align:middle line:84%
that you've been living in
or stay on the path you're on

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.970 align:middle line:84%
and eventually it
will get easier,

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:07.530 align:middle line:84%
it'll evolve, and
develop, and it'll

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.630 align:middle line:84%
become more rich
of an experience

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:11.850 align:middle line:84%
because the beginning
of these states,

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:15.390 align:middle line:84%
can feel kind of isolated
even though it's essentially

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.890 align:middle line:90%
a oneness state.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:18.687 align:middle line:84%
Of course, she's
progressed forward.

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are many such
stories in the book.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there are.

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And what you bring
up is interesting

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.850 align:middle line:84%
and what we're talking about
there are the notion of spirit

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and mind and how one defines
the other, when in fact,

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:35.100 align:middle line:84%
you can't even separate them
in the truest sense of the word

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.880 align:middle line:84%
and certainly in hermetic
parlance and many others,

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.160 align:middle line:90%
many traditions.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.390 align:middle line:84%
All there is-- that's
all there is, is mind

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't
mean left brain.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:51.150 align:middle line:84%
It means perception,
awareness, the ability

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.940 align:middle line:90%
to articulate between themes.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's always seemed to me
that the biggest roadblock

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:04.080 align:middle line:84%
for many people to having a
clear connection with higher

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:90%
mind--

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.510 align:middle line:84%
higher mind, which is
part of the soul complex

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.780 align:middle line:90%
is sense of identity.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.869 align:middle line:84%
As much as we try-- we
try to protect the story

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:18.109 align:middle line:84%
we've built about ourselves
and who we think we are,

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and that really closes down the
ability to just flat blossom

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and open to that
incredible connection

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:84%
because you might find out
something new that you're not

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:90%
or you are.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: We all tend to hold on
to our identity, this egotism.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:90%
And that keeps us stuck, yeah.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.530 align:middle line:84%
But when people get
on a spiritual path,

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:84%
something happens and that
opening arises, and then

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.650 align:middle line:90%
they're on their way.

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's also much of
the story of the book.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not only the story of
the individual scientist,

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.540 align:middle line:84%
it's what's happened to them and
how they got on their journey.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's also about the
larger spiritual journey--

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.400 align:middle line:84%
consciousness
development journey

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.610 align:middle line:84%
that all human beings are
absolutely entitled to

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:01.350 align:middle line:84%
and need to take
responsibility to start on

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.990 align:middle line:90%
if they're not already on it.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and
need to develop.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is the part I think
that's really tough for people,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.900 align:middle line:84%
is to develop the faith that
life with the capital L,

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.140 align:middle line:84%
meaning you, your soul,
your guidance, everything,

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.620 align:middle line:84%
is all there to lift you,
not to work against you.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And so having that faith
to understand change is OK.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Seeing yourself differently
and others differently is OK.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: And if science was
in that corner, so to speak,

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:84%
providing that information,
just philosophically number one,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.920 align:middle line:84%
or if some of the billions of
a year that go to biomedical

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of science
research were devoted to that

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:49.760 align:middle line:84%
so we as human beings can really
begin to understand and are

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.152 align:middle line:90%
supported in our potential--

00:18:51.152 --> 00:18:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --beautiful
it would be.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:53.943 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: It would be beautiful.

00:18:53.943 --> 00:18:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Our reality
would be beautiful.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.628 align:middle line:84%
And it's just-- it's
not that far away.

00:18:59.628 --> 00:19:00.920 align:middle line:90%
And I think we're headed there.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.910 align:middle line:90%
We talked about that.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about Dean
Radin for a moment.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:06.220 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our viewers
know Dean and you

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.820 align:middle line:90%
know Dean and I've met Dean.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.770 align:middle line:84%
I've been in his
workshops where we're

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:15.170 align:middle line:84%
talking about utilizing the
mind beyond time and space

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and his feelings on this,
because he's really, I mean,

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.790 align:middle line:84%
he's known for
his rational ways.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.000 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, the experiments

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.690 align:middle line:84%
he's conducted and
overseen are really--

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:30.300 align:middle line:84%
you can't argue the
results anymore.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.160 align:middle line:90%
We can't.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about his
position on the world

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:34.320 align:middle line:90%
of scientific materialism.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Yeah.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's not in
favor of it, of course,

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.620 align:middle line:90%
and he's been such a pioneer.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Probably the leading edge,
so to speak, of science

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.282 align:middle line:84%
is to have the most rigorous
scientific methodology, which

00:19:46.282 --> 00:19:48.740 align:middle line:84%
is always admired, of course,
and needed if you want to get

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.120 align:middle line:90%
into journals and so forth.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that
has been driven

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.320 align:middle line:90%
by his own personal experience.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And he shared with me when
we interviewed for the book.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And this was an experience he
had when he was in college.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out
it was his birthday,

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.063 align:middle line:84%
but he had been
born on a leap year.

00:20:07.063 --> 00:20:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And he's walking
across the campus

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and he was thinking himself,
oh, today is my birthday.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is he
shifted his consciousness,

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:17.330 align:middle line:84%
spontaneously
shifted, and suddenly

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.120 align:middle line:84%
he stepped into a new
dimension, so to speak.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And after he came into
the new dimension,

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.220 align:middle line:90%
he calls these step functions.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And he's had several of
them in his life since then.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And how does
he define step function?

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: It's when you leave
a prior state of consciousness

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.790 align:middle line:90%
behind, and you're in a new one.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And when he stepped
into the step function

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.910 align:middle line:84%
on the college
campus, he looked back

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:42.770 align:middle line:84%
in his memory of his
prior life and he said,

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.460 align:middle line:84%
it was like I had been
living in a fog, in a dream,

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.320 align:middle line:90%
my whole life up to that point.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And then going forward,
it was no more fog,

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.750 align:middle line:84%
there was no more dream, it
was utter lucidity about who

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.970 align:middle line:84%
he was, the nature
of consciousness,

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.000 align:middle line:84%
mind consciousness, as
let's say mind existing

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.690 align:middle line:84%
within consciousness because
consciousness is everything.

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And that began to
direct his future work,

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:09.630 align:middle line:84%
ultimately become a scientist
and to guide the work he does.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:10.430 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.410 align:middle line:90%
And he says you can't--

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:15.020 align:middle line:84%
we shouldn't just throw
out scientific materialism

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:18.230 align:middle line:84%
because it's very useful in
proving a lot in this world,

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.900 align:middle line:84%
but we cannot limit
ourselves to it any longer.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.640 align:middle line:84%
We're doing ourselves a
disservice as a species now.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Totally.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.630 align:middle line:84%
There's so much to
be said about that.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:30.860 align:middle line:84%
The materialism side and then
there's this term "scientism."

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Leon Kass, he was the chair
of Bioethics Committee

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:84%
for the president's counsel
at the White House some years

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:38.420 align:middle line:84%
back, and he spoke
about scientism

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.700 align:middle line:90%
as does Rupert Sheldrake.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, he does.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: Scientism is basically
this idea that science,

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.360 align:middle line:84%
as we know it, has become a kind
of religion for many people.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And Kass says it's basically
a soulless scientism,

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:84%
and has been draining from
us, as people, mystery,

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.300 align:middle line:90%
the mystery of our existence.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.940 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to just
quantify everything

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.930 align:middle line:84%
as a manifestation of
the material world only.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Sheldrake speaks of the
scientific priesthood.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's all that has to go.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.963 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely must go.

00:22:09.963 --> 00:22:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It must go.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: So that we can emerge
into our own and let science

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.000 align:middle line:84%
emerge into what
it was, was to be.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And I write in the book
about that initial split

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:90%
back four centuries ago.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Science should have been by
our side all these centuries,

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.830 align:middle line:84%
supporting us, guiding
us to flowering

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:29.870 align:middle line:90%
into who we were to be.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, up to this vision
of the future of the Earth,

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.810 align:middle line:84%
manifesting love and that
becoming a primary experience

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:36.680 align:middle line:90%
for human beings.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's been mainly
an impediment,

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.400 align:middle line:90%
but it's not too late.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.400 align:middle line:90%
It can evolve.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, Richard Feynman,
you wrote about in the book

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.290 align:middle line:84%
as well, Nobel Prize winner
in physics, physicists are--

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:84%
it's a little easier, it seems,
for physicists to get out

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:51.410 align:middle line:90%
there--

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Agreed.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --because
they're already working kind

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.680 align:middle line:90%
of in a non-physical world.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.380 align:middle line:84%
So scientific materialism
doesn't always--

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.630 align:middle line:84%
doesn't apply to physicists
for the most part

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.430 align:middle line:90%
so I find that very interesting.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Deep scientific minds
but able to fly out there

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.870 align:middle line:90%
as mystics as well.

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Yes.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:08.628 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so Feynman,
let's talk about him

00:23:08.628 --> 00:23:11.000 align:middle line:84%
because he's commenting,
he's talking about religion

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.540 align:middle line:84%
as a culture of faith and
science as a culture of doubt.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: And that's fair
enough, the culture of doubt.

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And as Dean Radin
said in his interview,

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.410 align:middle line:84%
and I was trained in
this scientifically,

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.770 align:middle line:84%
some degree of pessimism
is needed in science,

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:29.850 align:middle line:84%
but pessimism doesn't
mean close-mindedness.

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And so many scientists
have this close-mindedness.

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And what's paradisial is
someone will call themselves

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:40.650 align:middle line:84%
a scientist but tell you
absolutely there's no mystical,

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:42.330 align:middle line:84%
absolutely there's
no metaphysical.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:43.747 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
not a scientist,

00:23:43.747 --> 00:23:45.600 align:middle line:90%
there's no open mind.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: Based on not
having experience of it.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: How did that happen?

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: But it's happened,
and it's very accepted within

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.798 align:middle line:90%
the sciences, in that sense.

00:23:54.798 --> 00:23:56.340 align:middle line:10%
But you're right,
physicists, they're

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.110 align:middle line:10%
different than the
biomedical scientists

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.810 align:middle line:10%
that world are in
because they're

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:04.788 align:middle line:10%
in that level of reality
where eventually, things

00:24:04.788 --> 00:24:07.330 align:middle line:10%
start getting obvious, that it's
a little different than they

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:08.130 align:middle line:10%
thought.

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, when you
just get into the atomic level

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.990 align:middle line:84%
of reality and realized
there's nothing here.

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:16.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the big
surprise for me, that

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.640 align:middle line:84%
was the big shock and
surprise in my life

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.590 align:middle line:84%
when I was in my
30s, and I started

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:middle line:90%
reading about quantum reality.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think I started
with Michael Talbot,

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.350 align:middle line:84%
"Beyond the Quantum," I
think that was my first book.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And I still remember how
I felt when I read it,

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and it is mind-boggling
to, I think,

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.790 align:middle line:84%
almost everyone,
including the physicists,

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:39.700 align:middle line:84%
to think we're sitting
here talking to each other

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and we have a cup
of tea and a table

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.080 align:middle line:84%
but there's actually
nothing here.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the matter of a human
can fit on the pin of a head.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:50.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the head of
a pin, head of a pin.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:50.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, pinhead.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so what is this
construct in front of us?

00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And if any scientist understands
just the atomic weight

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.870 align:middle line:84%
of reality, which is
almost weight less,

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.600 align:middle line:84%
how come they can allow
themselves to go there?

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.350 align:middle line:90%
This is so obvious.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.050 align:middle line:90%
This is something else.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:14.380 align:middle line:90%
We're not material.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: I would say that's
part of the amazing hypnosis

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.580 align:middle line:84%
of what is often
called ignorance.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.340 align:middle line:84%
That even though you're
right, consciousness

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.970 align:middle line:84%
is infinite and eternal, we
are that, all of this is that,

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:31.860 align:middle line:84%
manifesting as
one, yet it appears

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.230 align:middle line:84%
to be all this differentiation
and differences.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we're
just hanging out

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:39.510 align:middle line:84%
a little bit too much with
the egoic identification.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And when we begin to
loosen that, as you know,

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:45.180 align:middle line:84%
then those other
perspectives fall away.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing the
reality of things.

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:48.120 align:middle line:90%
We're experiencing it.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:84%
We're knowing it based on
our deep sense of self,

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.810 align:middle line:90%
and that's the end of that.

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And then we can continue to live
life from a new perspective.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That makes
sense because if we do--

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.950 align:middle line:84%
when we go into this place
of en masse where humanity--

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.280 align:middle line:84%
there's a planet that actually
embodies and represents love

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.270 align:middle line:90%
in its truest form.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:10.020 align:middle line:84%
William Tiller called it
the solvent of the universe.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.510 align:middle line:90%
Love is the universal solvent.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Once we go to that place, that's
a much higher frequency range.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Now in there, we
should be starting

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.520 align:middle line:90%
to have different experiences.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Telepathically, we talk about
the thinning of veils now,

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.530 align:middle line:84%
they should be
super thin once we

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.660 align:middle line:84%
start reaching into
these higher frequencies

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:32.400 align:middle line:84%
where we simply see and know
and communicate more easily

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.500 align:middle line:84%
beyond the physical
realm, right?

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Yes.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.362 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I want
people, as this begins

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:38.820 align:middle line:84%
to happen more and
more for people,

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I want people to
have a confidence

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.980 align:middle line:90%
to proceed and step forward.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's also,
if I may say, part

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:48.930 align:middle line:84%
of the message of the book,
to take your own development

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.930 align:middle line:84%
into your own hands,
stop paying attention

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:54.690 align:middle line:84%
to things like the
materialistic sciences that

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:58.440 align:middle line:84%
say certain things don't
exist about your own spiritual

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.910 align:middle line:84%
nature, and pull that power
and belief and knowledge back

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.873 align:middle line:90%
in yourself and move forward.

00:27:04.873 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And I love one of
the statements,

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.260 align:middle line:84%
this is still around
Feynman I wrote here

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.190 align:middle line:84%
where he's talking about
science as a culture of doubt.

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's a quote
here from you,

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:20.760 align:middle line:84%
"skepticism translated
into close-mindedness

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.830 align:middle line:84%
is a poison, particularly
in the scientific inquiry."

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't agree
more with that.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.840 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a poison
that stops all growth.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.580 align:middle line:84%
It stops the expansion
of consciousness.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.482 align:middle line:90%
It stops love.

00:27:36.482 --> 00:27:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: I'm with
you all the way.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Skepticism, and
people pride themselves

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.020 align:middle line:90%
on skepticism.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.197 align:middle line:84%
But even the skeptic, the
famous, what's his name?

00:27:45.197 --> 00:27:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Michael Shermer.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.488 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Michael Shermer,
I started to say Schuman.

00:27:48.488 --> 00:27:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Michael Shermer, even he had
his own metaphysical experiences

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and then goes about publicly
trying to deny such a thing

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:57.110 align:middle line:90%
ever exists.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Even the biggest,
most public skeptic

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.890 align:middle line:90%
certainly in this country.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:04.650 align:middle line:84%
So these are lies now,
they're protecting ego.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:06.410 align:middle line:90%
It's all to protect ego.

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:07.790 align:middle line:90%
All to protect ego.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:11.030 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to stop
listening to, I think, skeptics.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:14.330 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand now,
I'm a devil's advocate here.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a world
where people are creating

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.300 align:middle line:84%
their own realities, where
algorithms are reinforcing

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.630 align:middle line:84%
preferences which are
becoming beliefs, which

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:26.180 align:middle line:84%
are becoming a source of
more and more and more

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.130 align:middle line:90%
division and ignorance.

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So when you have people
embracing so much

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:36.520 align:middle line:84%
BS that scoots around
the planet as clickbait

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.670 align:middle line:84%
and becomes realities,
now it's reality,

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:44.350 align:middle line:84%
where does a healthy dose
of skepticism fit in?

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Or do we just call
it discernment?

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:47.680 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Yeah.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a vitally
important point you're raising.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And I like the word
discernment quite a bit.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And what you know, Tiffany
my wife, Tiffany Barsotti,

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.530 align:middle line:84%
she's been working
a lot in this area.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.720 align:middle line:84%
teaching a course,
helping people

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.510 align:middle line:84%
raise their level
of discernment.

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's something we all
innately have the capacity

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.170 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:09.880 align:middle line:84%
It's listening to
that inner voice.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.130 align:middle line:84%
It's doing our
best to turn inside

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.250 align:middle line:84%
for that initial
hit, of first hit,

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:17.680 align:middle line:84%
best hit is something
Carolyn Mays often said

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.350 align:middle line:84%
and Tiff has shared that
with me several times.

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:25.240 align:middle line:84%
We have an internal compass
that can get us there.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.480 align:middle line:84%
We just have to have confidence
in it to listen to it

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.720 align:middle line:90%
and move forward.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.740 align:middle line:84%
But that said, that's a
challenging, challenging time.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.540 align:middle line:84%
The word clickbait--
click, bait,

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I'd never heard that
before, that's a good one--

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:41.980 align:middle line:84%
we're being endlessly distracted
out in our environment

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.217 align:middle line:84%
with media, as you know,
and that's a challenge.

00:29:44.217 --> 00:29:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I'm really concerned.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm concerned, and
I've said this on other shows

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.980 align:middle line:84%
and I know every generation is
concerned about the next one,

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:54.010 align:middle line:84%
oh they're wearing
their skirts too short.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.210 align:middle line:90%
OK, right.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, this is
a little different.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.820 align:middle line:84%
The brains are being
wired differently now.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking
about something

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.410 align:middle line:84%
where attention spans
have been shortened,

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:07.652 align:middle line:84%
where people are
embracing, like I said,

00:30:07.652 --> 00:30:09.610 align:middle line:84%
they're embracing whatever's
coming before them

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:14.080 align:middle line:84%
as though it's real when it may
have no reality at all into it

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:18.340 align:middle line:84%
because it's
exciting, it's almost

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:22.900 align:middle line:84%
like an excito-toxin
in the brain

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.240 align:middle line:84%
like you get from
aspartame and such.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.240 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing that's
happening through media

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and mostly interactive
media, even more so

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:34.720 align:middle line:84%
but media in general being
fed in streams like this,

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.940 align:middle line:90%
where you're now numb.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.620 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond discernment.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Yeah.

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:41.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a tough state
to get out of it.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:42.940 align:middle line:90%
It's very hypnotic.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Very hypnotic
and it's feeding some neural

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:48.950 align:middle line:84%
networking that's rewiring
itself in the brain.

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So everything you're talking
about makes perfect sense.

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:57.460 align:middle line:84%
But now, how does that extend
into a generation of people

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.220 align:middle line:84%
that spends most of
their time on devices

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:01.490 align:middle line:90%
that are rewiring the brain?

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Yeah.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:04.165 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How do you
go back to discernment?

00:31:04.165 --> 00:31:07.390 align:middle line:84%
How do we teach our children
and grandchildren again?

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:11.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Senator Waldorf,
that's why I hate to say that,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.670 align:middle line:90%
but that's one way to do it.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:15.190 align:middle line:90%
Get rid of the stuff.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: You mentioned earlier
your openness and sensitivity

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:20.380 align:middle line:84%
to your guides and
the spiritual world.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.390 align:middle line:84%
My personal
experience around this

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.370 align:middle line:84%
lately is that there's more,
there's help on the way,

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:26.290 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a different
vibration coming in

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:32.033 align:middle line:84%
that I think is purposeful
to try to help us overcome

00:31:32.033 --> 00:31:32.950 align:middle line:90%
these sorts of things.

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:34.075 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I think so, too.

00:31:34.075 --> 00:31:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed in a
conversation with Lee Harris

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:39.460 align:middle line:84%
recently that his
group, the Z's,

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.210 align:middle line:84%
normally they approach
people in a gentle way

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and that's kind of the
edge is coming out now,

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:46.810 align:middle line:90%
which is you know what?

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:48.100 align:middle line:90%
Time to get real.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And so even they are starting
to speak a little bit more

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.610 align:middle line:84%
directly to humanity,
and same thing

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.860 align:middle line:84%
with my guides and
yours and everybody else

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.360 align:middle line:90%
is, it's time to get real now.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.115 align:middle line:84%
You have some issues
here, you have

00:32:00.115 --> 00:32:01.240 align:middle line:90%
to start dealing with them.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.383 align:middle line:84%
You can't sweep them
under the rug any longer.

00:32:03.383 --> 00:32:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: Agreed, and I want
to go back to the media piece

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.975 align:middle line:84%
because for our listeners
to know how challenging

00:32:09.975 --> 00:32:12.100 align:middle line:84%
and adverse that can be,
particularly for the young

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:16.240 align:middle line:84%
people, there's a story in the
book that one of my scientists

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.150 align:middle line:84%
used to travel to Thailand
regularly as part of his own

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:21.910 align:middle line:84%
scientific research on
religion and mysticism.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:24.790 align:middle line:84%
He was speaking to some
of the nuns at a monastery

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:25.750 align:middle line:90%
there a convent.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And those nuns had
young people come there

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:31.000 align:middle line:84%
for generations and
generations and generations

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.860 align:middle line:90%
to do deep retreats.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:36.190 align:middle line:84%
A couple of weeks, they
were there at the convent.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And that would lead
them into an opening,

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.980 align:middle line:84%
a degree of self-realization
that would then guide them

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.750 align:middle line:90%
forward in their lives.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:47.290 align:middle line:84%
What the nuns noticed over
the last couple of decades

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:51.160 align:middle line:84%
as the media presence started
to ramp up in Thailand,

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.910 align:middle line:84%
the capacity for the students
to enter into these states

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:58.120 align:middle line:84%
diminished and diminished and
diminished and diminished.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:05.730 align:middle line:84%
The parents of kids, people
don't like hearing this,

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.900 align:middle line:84%
but I think we've
reached a critical point.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:11.580 align:middle line:84%
If we want to have an ability
for future generations

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.880 align:middle line:84%
to think clearly, these
devices need to go.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.010 align:middle line:84%
They have to go
except for research,

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:18.600 align:middle line:84%
maybe for school
work or whatever.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.010 align:middle line:90%
They have to go.

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:22.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't know any other way.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:25.195 align:middle line:84%
You can't do halfway when you
have an addictive pattern that

00:33:25.195 --> 00:33:26.320 align:middle line:90%
is reprogramming the brain.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.740 align:middle line:90%
You want more and more and more.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And as the nuns
notice, the capacity

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:33.550 align:middle line:84%
for organic functioning
lowers and lowers and lowers.

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
bringing that up.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And that comes to
another one, and this is

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.750 align:middle line:90%
Thomas Brophy, physicist again.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:44.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the collapse
of the wave function, which

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.410 align:middle line:90%
means determined outcomes.

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:48.130 align:middle line:84%
So now, that's getting into
the world of quantum science

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and waves and particles and
consciousness and everything

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:56.060 align:middle line:84%
working together and
observer effect and so forth.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.810 align:middle line:84%
But riffing on what
we just talked about,

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:01.780 align:middle line:84%
extend that into when
the wave collapses,

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:05.440 align:middle line:84%
you have an outcome, which
these are called choices,

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.940 align:middle line:90%
choice points.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:11.170 align:middle line:84%
How do you make choices
with a muddled, unclear,

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:13.330 align:middle line:90%
programmed mind?

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:17.020 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible to have even
successful collapse of wave

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:20.669 align:middle line:90%
function into a good outcome?

00:34:20.669 --> 00:34:21.469 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Yeah.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:21.889 align:middle line:90%
Getting--

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:23.847 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I don't mean
to be pessimistic here.

00:34:23.847 --> 00:34:26.565 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying we've got an
issue we have to deal with.

00:34:26.565 --> 00:34:29.210 align:middle line:90%


00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: I'll answer that by
saying getting back to doing

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:34.969 align:middle line:84%
our best as we can to listen
to that internal voice,

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:37.370 align:middle line:84%
that internal wisdom
because in the book,

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Thomas shares a story where he
was struggling with this exact

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:44.330 align:middle line:84%
issue for part of his scientific
research because he had more

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:47.989 align:middle line:84%
mystical psychic experience as
a child that led him to science,

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:50.960 align:middle line:84%
but he was still struggling
with this idea about energy

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.600 align:middle line:84%
conversation and the waveform
and the particle and so forth.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.370 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know
how to resolve it.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And he was sitting at
his office in Tokyo.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.550 align:middle line:84%
He had been invited as part
of a scholarship fellowship

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:04.200 align:middle line:90%
to do some physics work there.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And he saw a crow
land on a branch,

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.290 align:middle line:90%
and it was one of those moments.

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:11.810 align:middle line:84%
He'd seen a crow land on
a branch hundreds of times

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.730 align:middle line:84%
before, but something
clicked for him.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And it gave him the
answer he needed.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And for him, it had to
do with the difference

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.890 align:middle line:84%
of a biological living system,
how it could manage energy

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:25.670 align:middle line:84%
in these contexts versus
just a pure physics system.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And that really
resolved it for him.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:31.430 align:middle line:84%
That was an insight that he
was able to have and then

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:32.390 align:middle line:90%
move forward.

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And if I may add, he had a
very interesting experience

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:35.420 align:middle line:90%
as a child.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.837 align:middle line:84%
There were several
in the book who

00:35:36.837 --> 00:35:38.480 align:middle line:90%
were very psychic as children.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.910 align:middle line:84%
He, as well as
another scientist,

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:43.490 align:middle line:84%
went up to the parents, in
this case Thomas to his father,

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:45.530 align:middle line:84%
and said, dad, I can
read your thoughts.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:46.880 align:middle line:90%
His father said, no, you can't.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So Thomas proceeded
to read his thoughts.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.020 align:middle line:90%
Bam, bam, bam, perfect.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And his father said,
that's impossible.

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:55.290 align:middle line:90%
And Thomas said--

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And I just did it.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: I just did it.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And then his father
said, physics has proved,

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.285 align:middle line:84%
science has proved
that's not possible.

00:36:01.285 --> 00:36:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh my god.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: So that's an example
of the materialism side

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:10.350 align:middle line:84%
of science closing our minds to
the reality of what is in front

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:12.920 align:middle line:84%
of us in our perception, and
how has that been happening

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:13.720 align:middle line:90%
for centuries.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When it's right in
front of you, you have proof,

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:19.893 align:middle line:84%
then you say, no,
and turn a blind eye.

00:36:19.893 --> 00:36:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: That's a hypnosis.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That is a hypnosis.

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And our world is in a trance,
in mass hypnosis as particularly

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:30.690 align:middle line:84%
not so much in Indigenous
areas where people are still

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:33.530 align:middle line:84%
a bit secluded and away
from electronics and media

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:34.330 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But in the modern world where
anyone has access to media now,

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:42.480 align:middle line:84%
media is not as clean
as it used to be.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying-- for
example, when I was a kid

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and you'd watch the news, you
had the old guys there giving

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.170 align:middle line:84%
the news and it was
not editorialized.

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, you always had
sponsors, you always

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:56.610 align:middle line:84%
had people behind the
scenes, you always

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:59.850 align:middle line:84%
had people at the top deciding
the nature of the story.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:03.210 align:middle line:84%
But by and large, you could kind
of get what happened in a day

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:05.610 align:middle line:90%
without editorializing.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:06.690 align:middle line:90%
You can't get that now.

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:07.890 align:middle line:90%
That's not possible.

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:11.760 align:middle line:84%
You choose your station because
of its editorial position

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.360 align:middle line:90%
so you're already now siloed.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Yes.

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it starts very
innocently where we think

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:21.470 align:middle line:84%
we're watching like
CNN, MSNBC, Fox.

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Already, you're in a silo
by turning the TV on.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.105 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:37:26.105 --> 00:37:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Close-mindedness.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Close-mindedness.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Fundamentalism.

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:30.413 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Fundamentalism.

00:37:30.413 --> 00:37:34.160 align:middle line:84%
These are all accurate words
for when we consume and take

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.490 align:middle line:90%
those positions.

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:36.710 align:middle line:90%
So let's-- yeah, go ahead.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:38.162 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: Well,
just the question,

00:37:38.162 --> 00:37:39.620 align:middle line:84%
and you've raised
it several times,

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:43.010 align:middle line:84%
how does an individual
get out of that?

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Because humanity's been in it
for centuries, we could say.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:48.590 align:middle line:84%
The vast leaps of
Western absolutely.

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:51.530 align:middle line:84%
We as individuals have been in
it and sometimes we pop out,

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:54.890 align:middle line:84%
the scientists in the book, they
popped out for various reasons.

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Many others have
been popping out.

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:59.660 align:middle line:84%
But people who are really deep
in it, how do they get out?

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And I guess, spreading the
word and hopefully these higher

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:06.170 align:middle line:84%
vibrations start
to loosen things up

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:06.860 align:middle line:90%
for people's consciousness.

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I think
that's where love comes

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:12.800 align:middle line:84%
in because if you do go into
some of these little practices

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.825 align:middle line:84%
of thinking of someone
you love today,

00:38:14.825 --> 00:38:16.700 align:middle line:84%
thinking how much you
love your little kitty,

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:19.190 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter
who or what it is,

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:23.700 align:middle line:84%
how much you love just making
an apple pie for a friend.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.850 align:middle line:84%
These vibrations
of love do start

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:29.270 align:middle line:84%
lifting you to a higher
frequency than the data that's

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:30.110 align:middle line:90%
coming in.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:32.540 align:middle line:84%
But proportionately, it's
still out of balance.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:36.590 align:middle line:84%
You have to spend more
time in fostering feelings

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:40.730 align:middle line:84%
of care and love for one
another and fewer hours on media

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:43.310 align:middle line:84%
to be able to shift
that balance to where

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:47.630 align:middle line:84%
you can have more clear
communication with self, higher

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:52.830 align:middle line:84%
self, and then make
thus clearer decisions.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:57.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think anyone can do
it as a commitment to that.

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: Well, may I add
and speak about gratitude

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:00.690 align:middle line:90%
for a moment?

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: You
mentioned that earlier.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Some years ago at UC
San Diego, and this

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:07.490 align:middle line:84%
was in collaboration with the
Chopra Foundation and Deepak

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Chopra, we did several
studies on gratitude.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And these were both
cross-sectional studies

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:15.590 align:middle line:84%
and more the gold standard
randomized control studies

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:18.650 align:middle line:84%
where we had mainly cardiac
patients keep gratitude

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:20.870 align:middle line:84%
journals, and
others we randomized

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:22.460 align:middle line:90%
to treatment as usual.

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Those who kept a gratitude
journal for two months only,

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.340 align:middle line:84%
writing down most
days of the week

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:32.030 align:middle line:84%
a few things they were grateful
for, had such transformations.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Not only in their
mind, not only did

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:36.500 align:middle line:84%
they have a bit less
depression and more gratitude

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and they slept better, but their
hearts started working better.

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:40.790 align:middle line:90%
These were cardiac patients.

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And they had
reductions in a handful

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:46.620 align:middle line:84%
of inflammatory
biomarkers and the blood,

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:48.710 align:middle line:84%
including biomarkers
specifically

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:51.360 align:middle line:84%
for the functioning
of the heart itself.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.660 align:middle line:84%
So this was powerful
and this works

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:56.660 align:middle line:84%
because as we said earlier,
gratitude, I look at it

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.520 align:middle line:90%
as a kind of a soul attribute.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a soul inheritance
that we just

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.210 align:middle line:84%
need to look at
and start using it,

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and then it starts
to give us gifts.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And one of those gifts is it
helps to overcome egotism.

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:11.660 align:middle line:84%
It helps to overcome separation,
the illusion of separation

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:13.100 align:middle line:90%
that you and I are different.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And it begins to activate
love and appreciation.

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which is
radiant health as well.

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:20.847 align:middle line:90%
As a booster.

00:40:20.847 --> 00:40:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's use-- we're going to
talk about something fun here

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:23.980 align:middle line:90%
for a minute.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.700 align:middle line:84%
We'll go into Tiffany's
story about the Ouija board.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Oh yeah.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
let's talk about that.

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Right now?

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
let's talk about that.

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:31.190 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:33.290 align:middle line:84%
I put it in here so we
can have some fun with it

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:35.870 align:middle line:84%
and suppose Tiffany,
dear Tiffany who

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:37.190 align:middle line:90%
I've interviewed several times.

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Yeah.

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, Tiff, as a young person,
had all the clairs as you know

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:42.440 align:middle line:90%
and she's spoken about that.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Her mother was
acutely aware of this.

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:47.600 align:middle line:84%
She had a reputation about
that having that openness

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and having information
to share with people

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:51.500 align:middle line:90%
coming in and out of the house.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:55.243 align:middle line:84%
Her mother was interested for
some time in the Ouija board,

00:40:55.243 --> 00:40:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and they would sit down,
her friends would come over

00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:58.743 align:middle line:90%
and they played the Ouija board.

00:40:58.743 --> 00:41:01.717 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, Tiffany
walked into the room

00:41:01.717 --> 00:41:03.800 align:middle line:84%
when the adults were playing
it and they were just

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.620 align:middle line:84%
about to proceed with
finding the answer

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.270 align:middle line:90%
to a certain question.

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And the Ouija board did
not provide an answer

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:13.160 align:middle line:84%
to the question that
the adults had posed.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Instead, the Ouija board did
its-- people did its thing

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and it basically spelled
out, "do not let Tiffany work

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.280 align:middle line:90%
with the Ouija board."

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.372 align:middle line:90%
She's way too open.

00:41:23.372 --> 00:41:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
I understand that.

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: And that was why.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I love that
little story because this is

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:29.220 align:middle line:90%
another thing.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we are quite
credulous when we're young.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you're really
open on top of it,

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.680 align:middle line:84%
you can be led down
some interesting paths

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.130 align:middle line:90%
that you might not want to go.

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So we need to have the
discernment again of what

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:42.710 align:middle line:90%
if we play with metaphysically.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:44.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me,
the Ouija board was

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:47.780 align:middle line:84%
something I ran into when
I was quite a bit older.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.370 align:middle line:90%
I was in my early 30s.

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I played with
it and the little plank

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.840 align:middle line:90%
that just took off.

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:53.760 align:middle line:90%
It just took off.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.385 align:middle line:84%
It was like
[IMITATING SWOOSHING SOUND]

00:41:55.385 --> 00:41:56.943 align:middle line:84%
and I could hardly
hang on to it.

00:41:56.943 --> 00:41:58.610 align:middle line:84%
It would kind of skip
out of my fingers.

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:03.790 align:middle line:84%
But what it said right off the
bat was, "go get a pencil."

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:05.360 align:middle line:90%
I thought, thank you.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.140 align:middle line:90%
This is like out of control.

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So I go-- anyone
who's read my book

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:12.290 align:middle line:84%
knows about that little story
about starting to connect.

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:13.950 align:middle line:90%
But so I went and got a pencil.

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:15.180 align:middle line:90%
And then I thought, OK what?

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:18.210 align:middle line:90%
And they said, "get some paper."

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I went like this, I'm
not going to participate.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:24.830 align:middle line:90%
I'll let my hand participate.

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And this amazing thing started
happening with my hand.

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:30.200 align:middle line:84%
The images were perfect
right over each other,

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.520 align:middle line:90%
perfect, whatever it was.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And that led to automatic
typing and then pretty soon it

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:38.960 align:middle line:84%
leads to-- so for me, it
was actually an entry point

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.600 align:middle line:84%
into developing my
intuitive connection.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Beautiful.

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But I was
older, I had a little bit

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.310 align:middle line:90%
of discernment, I was given--

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:47.750 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't given bum advice.

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:49.380 align:middle line:90%
There were no weird entities.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I was given good advice.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.360 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
true for everyone.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.160 align:middle line:90%
And be careful.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.910 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people play
with the Ouija board

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:56.180 align:middle line:90%
and have different results.

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And then it scares the
bejesus because you've just

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:02.480 align:middle line:84%
gotten some random entity that's
going to play its game out.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that's nice
that she was protected.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.130 align:middle line:90%
She was protected from that.

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And you write about
Robert Frost, the poet.

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And his whole
notion was to awaken

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:20.480 align:middle line:84%
as using art and poetry
as a means of awakening

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.870 align:middle line:90%
into that part of ourselves.

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:23.330 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that for a bit.

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: Yeah, and I'll add
Matthew Fox who I wrote about

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.860 align:middle line:84%
in his book, his creation
spirituality, and others.

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:35.340 align:middle line:84%
That's often, those who
become more awake to,

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:38.940 align:middle line:84%
let's say, our human
inheritance as spiritual beings

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.160 align:middle line:84%
living here in the
Earth, they always

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:46.800 align:middle line:84%
seem to get to that point,
art, poetry, creativity.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.350 align:middle line:84%
These are the
gates when we start

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:52.380 align:middle line:84%
to attend to those as
activities and disciplines even.

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:56.735 align:middle line:84%
Then our inner selves can begin
to unfold into our own lives

00:43:56.735 --> 00:43:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and then into the
lives of others

00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and certainly for people
like Frost and others

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.080 align:middle line:90%
into society at large.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Then we begin to benefit
from this beautiful insight

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:07.240 align:middle line:90%
and the knowledge that emerges.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:10.530 align:middle line:84%
We are all just incredibly
beautiful mystical beings,

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:15.340 align:middle line:84%
each with gifts to share with
each other and the world.

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And as you were saying
earlier, it's time.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.790 align:middle line:84%
We just need to
say this is true,

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and start taking
those steps forward.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And avoiding the things that are
derailing us, by distractions,

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:31.620 align:middle line:84%
doubts, seek out supportive
communities and systems for you

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:32.910 align:middle line:90%
with discernment.

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And don't buy
into the old industrialized,

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:39.570 align:middle line:84%
institutional way this Earth
has been and continues to be

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:40.710 align:middle line:90%
conducting business.

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Just don't buy into it,
which is number one,

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't have time for that.

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:46.650 align:middle line:84%
I need to put in
some more hours.

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:49.480 align:middle line:84%
I haven't met my financial
goals and blah, blah, blah,

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.210 align:middle line:90%
whatever we do as humans.

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:55.710 align:middle line:84%
We set aside the finer things
like writing a little poem

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:59.760 align:middle line:84%
or maybe drawing a picture or
using our creative processes

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.260 align:middle line:90%
for whatever-- cooking even--

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:06.210 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is to engage in
the dreamy process of creation

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:10.020 align:middle line:84%
is opening us up into
higher realms once again.

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: So the dreamy
side, again, in the book,

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I write a lot about Owen
Barfield writings about

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:16.680 align:middle line:90%
imagination and others.

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Imagination, any
spiritual tradition

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:21.450 align:middle line:84%
understands imagination
as a spiritual gift.

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Again, let's say from the soul
as part of our higher mind.

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Historically, and
I was raised-- now

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:30.390 align:middle line:84%
that's just your
imagination, we discount it.

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Yes, start using your
imagination more.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:34.680 align:middle line:90%
It's a gift.

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.780 align:middle line:84%
It'll get you where
you want to go.

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:37.750 align:middle line:90%
Have faith in it.

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that
is not time wasted.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is you're trying
to do with your imagination,

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.370 align:middle line:90%
do it.

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:46.020 align:middle line:90%
Take the time to do it.

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And Barbara McClintock,
before we finish up,

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.040 align:middle line:90%
we're about out of time.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Barbara McClintock, she
won her Nobel in physiology

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and she said, "if you
know whether you're

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.870 align:middle line:84%
on the right track, do
not let other people

00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:02.020 align:middle line:84%
dissuade you and turn you
away from your own knowingness

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:02.820 align:middle line:90%
inside."

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.177 align:middle line:84%
And this is what you've
said many times today.

00:46:05.177 --> 00:46:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: I have, and
that's part of the structure

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:08.060 align:middle line:90%
of the book.

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.840 align:middle line:84%
I follow Joseph
Campbell's monomyth

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and there's always a
stage in the monomyth,

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and if I may
summarize, the monomyth

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.730 align:middle line:84%
begins with somebody having a
spiritual call to do something.

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And we've spoken
about that today.

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:22.538 align:middle line:84%
An intuition, something
pops up, follow it.

00:46:22.538 --> 00:46:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And then if you do,
what's going to happen?

00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:28.350 align:middle line:84%
The next stage of the monomyth
is a mentor will show up.

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:30.150 align:middle line:84%
They will be there
to help guide you.

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:33.210 align:middle line:10%
The next step is the
adversary, and that's

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:35.910 align:middle line:10%
what that has to do with don't
listen to the adversary who

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:37.770 align:middle line:10%
says, oh don't go
down that path,

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:39.300 align:middle line:10%
go back to your
normal self, go back

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.620 align:middle line:10%
to your conditioned reality.

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Go back to what
you know and is comfortable.

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: And are comfortable.

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:44.490 align:middle line:90%
Don't do it.

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:45.930 align:middle line:90%
Proceed to the next step.

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:49.440 align:middle line:10%
Step, which is basically
finding your gifts

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.968 align:middle line:10%
and bringing them back
to the world to share.

00:46:51.968 --> 00:46:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We could end on that
note but do you have anything

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:56.140 align:middle line:90%
else you'd like to say?

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>> MILLS: That is so
good not to share.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: People will
say goodbye, I love it.

00:46:58.090 --> 00:46:59.173 align:middle line:90%
>> MILLS: Find your gifts.

00:46:59.173 --> 00:47:01.662 align:middle line:84%
Share them with love,
with everyone else.
