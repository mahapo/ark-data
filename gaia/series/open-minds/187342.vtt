a leading researcher
on giant bones

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.980 align:middle line:84%
in Sardinia, who has
discovered evidence pointing

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.280 align:middle line:84%
to the connection between
the island of Sardinia

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.030 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient
culture of Atlantis.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Their elaborate stone sites,
roughly 7,000 of them,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.470 align:middle line:84%
are sprinkled all over the
island, revealing tombs, bones,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and highly sophisticated
architecture.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.690 align:middle line:84%
It's speculated that
people from Atlantis,

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.360 align:middle line:84%
including a giant
race of people,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.269 align:middle line:84%
emigrated to Sardinia with
their great knowledge,

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.320 align:middle line:84%
leaving their tombs and
temples called nuraghe behind.

have been highly

before our current time
begs many questions

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.850 align:middle line:90%
that we've been grappling with.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Why did they disappear?

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.905 align:middle line:84%
And how many more are there
buried under the sands of time?

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.009 align:middle line:90%
Hi, everybody.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.463 align:middle line:10%
We're here in absolutely
stunningly beautiful Sardinia.

00:02:13.463 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:10%
And today I'm with Freddy Silva,
who we've been out in the field

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.930 align:middle line:10%
together.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.710 align:middle line:10%
We've made some
stunning discoveries

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.080 align:middle line:10%
which we're going to be
talking about in just a sec.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.380 align:middle line:84%
First, I want to get some
of your impressions about--

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:84%
your first impressions
about being out in the field

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.160 align:middle line:84%
just among this raw land
and these ancient sites.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It was nice
being in a place

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.080 align:middle line:84%
where you know
very little about,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.970 align:middle line:84%
or little has been
written about,

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.440 align:middle line:90%
and it's full of surprises.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.540 align:middle line:84%
It's blowing my mind
every single time.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.250 align:middle line:84%
The age of things,
such as the fact

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.150 align:middle line:84%
that we're sitting on the oldest
rocks in Europe to begin with,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.150 align:middle line:90%
which is quite stunning.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:90%
The landscape is extraordinary.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's the level
and depth of history

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.040 align:middle line:84%
that's here that few
people know about.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.760 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of rare to be in that
situation in the 21st century

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.838 align:middle line:84%
where you go somewhere
and you can think, oh,

00:02:57.838 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:84%
we have raw material
here we can work with.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was shocked.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: How we're
connected to other things.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And researching, you know for
yourself, starting to research

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.740 align:middle line:90%
before we came here.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:84%
They never really spoke a
lot about the nuraghe even.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: No.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, by the
time the Greeks show up,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.083 align:middle line:84%
people just had these
myths and stories to tell,

00:03:16.083 --> 00:03:17.750 align:middle line:84%
and there was
superstition about things.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.492 align:middle line:84%
In fact, no one
even remembers why

00:03:19.492 --> 00:03:21.200 align:middle line:84%
they were called the
towers of the giants

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.325 align:middle line:90%
or the tombs of the giants.

00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:25.370 align:middle line:84%
It seems to have been in the
vernacular, in the folklore.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.890 align:middle line:84%
But it was so lost to
history in the mist of time

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.450 align:middle line:90%
that they're just stories.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.950 align:middle line:84%
But the stories
is where we begin

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.510 align:middle line:84%
because those are
the things that

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.520 align:middle line:84%
contain the kernel
of the information

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:90%
that we're looking for.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And that was so
interesting going out

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.480 align:middle line:84%
in the field in our last
episode, talking with Luigi

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.400 align:middle line:84%
whose family
history is very much

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.730 align:middle line:84%
tied to what some call
the legends of the giants.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:47.810 align:middle line:90%
And they say, no.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:90%
These are our ancestors.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.430 align:middle line:10%
So first of all, what was
interesting is I called you,

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.300 align:middle line:10%
and you had just finished this
book called "Missing Lands."

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.060 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, how
convenient is this?

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.920 align:middle line:10%
"Missing Lands" is
coming out right

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:10%
when we call you to see about
looking for what might be

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.240 align:middle line:10%
another of the missing lands.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.945 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the thing
that fascinates me

00:04:08.945 --> 00:04:10.820 align:middle line:84%
about the research into
ancient civilizations

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and a missing
civilization at that

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.650 align:middle line:84%
was that we've been so focused
on things like Atlantis

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:90%
or Lemuria.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.700 align:middle line:84%
But we've blinkered
ourselves to the point where

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.180 align:middle line:90%
we don't think beyond that.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's been an
extraordinary revelation

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.000 align:middle line:84%
to realize that there are
other places that are missing.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.770 align:middle line:84%
There are other
stories which talk

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.140 align:middle line:84%
about missing people
and missing sages

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:84%
and magicians and
priests that came

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.890 align:middle line:84%
from different
parts of the world.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Seven of them, as far
as I can figure out.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.473 align:middle line:84%
And I think Sardinia kind
of fits into this paradigm.

00:04:38.473 --> 00:04:39.890 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
things here which

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.980 align:middle line:84%
seem to fit in very
nicely with the stories

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.580 align:middle line:84%
that we hear in other parts of
the world, as far away as Peru,

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.430 align:middle line:84%
as far away as Easter
Island and even Orkney.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's something here that
obviously merits attention.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.038 align:middle line:84%
So Freddy, first of all, why
did you write "Missing Lands?"

00:04:56.038 --> 00:04:57.830 align:middle line:84%
We're going to tie that
story in because it

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:84%
lays a really nice
backdrop for what we're

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.357 align:middle line:84%
going to see when we
go out in the field

00:05:01.357 --> 00:05:03.167 align:middle line:84%
with these incredible
ancient sites.

00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:05.750 align:middle line:84%
What were you trying to bring
to the world in "Missing Lands?"

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: The humanity of it.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:84%
We hear so much about
Plato and we hear so much

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.382 align:middle line:84%
about things which he had done
on a very scholarly level,

00:05:12.382 --> 00:05:14.090 align:middle line:84%
but there's a humanity
missing, you know?

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And for me it was
about the people.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Who were these people that
we keep talking about?

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.370 align:middle line:10%
There are these
missing civilizations

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.460 align:middle line:10%
that we hear about, the
Anu and the Anunnaki.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:10%
And they begin a very
bad sort of time--

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.365 align:middle line:10%
PR, in terms of PR.

00:05:27.365 --> 00:05:29.240 align:middle line:84%
They're always seen in
a very negative light.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.490 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't my intention at
all, and it wasn't certainly

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:90%
my impression.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to bring that
out in a positive way,

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.730 align:middle line:84%
in the way that was written
a long, long time ago,

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:84%
and connect all those
dots and figure out,

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.067 align:middle line:90%
why were these people here?

00:05:41.067 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:90%
Where did they live?

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.130 align:middle line:90%
What was their purpose?

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And why did they live separately
from the rest of the human race

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:46.730 align:middle line:90%
all the time?

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:84%
They seemed to be on
islands all the time.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.780 align:middle line:84%
They seemed to keep
away from humanity,

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.810 align:middle line:84%
but they were very much focused
on the development of humanity.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.310 align:middle line:84%
They were very
concerned about where

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.170 align:middle line:84%
we were going from
hunter gatherers

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.580 align:middle line:90%
into another level of education.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's what fascinated
me about the whole thing.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And again, I never
have any idea where

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm going with these projects.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.123 align:middle line:84%
I let the story and the
evidence reveal itself

00:06:08.123 --> 00:06:09.290 align:middle line:90%
and see how it all connects.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you follow
the breadcrumbs, basically.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
start tying it together.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.012 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: A piece of
bread from breadcrumbs.

00:06:15.012 --> 00:06:17.102 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the bread
crumbs end up nowhere,

00:06:17.102 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:90%
and you just let it go.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes the
breadcrumbs do come together

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.790 align:middle line:84%
and you start putting together
this wonderful recipe,

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.250 align:middle line:90%
and it speaks for itself.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.000 align:middle line:90%
You take your ego out of it.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.970 align:middle line:84%
You let the people
in the old days--

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.580 align:middle line:84%
not the scholars, because so
much of what we know today

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:84%
comes from a westerly,
Anglo-Saxon approach,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.290 align:middle line:90%
and they always never--

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Total scientific
materialism, you know?

00:06:38.435 --> 00:06:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Trying to date things,
carbon date things that

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:90%
can't be carbon dated even.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:43.070 align:middle line:90%
Like rocks.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.895 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:43.895 --> 00:06:44.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And then when were
the rocks actually

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:90%
chiseled in place there?

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.770 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole other subject.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.560 align:middle line:84%
So you identified
seven different kind

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.580 align:middle line:84%
of-- what some call the navel
centers of modern civilization.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And modern means essentially
after the great deluge,

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.960 align:middle line:84%
about 11,000, 12,000
years ago, right?

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So after that,
we sometimes tap into

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.350 align:middle line:90%
what happened before.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.410 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult because the
world was covered in mud, OK?

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And you and I talked about this
out in the field quite a bit.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.400 align:middle line:84%
What we're looking
at as our evidence

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:90%
is only what we can see.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So much layered, all
these civilizations

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:90%
layered underneath it.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And let's for a moment go
back to the Atlantis myth

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:84%
because in Sardinia, they do
not believe this is a myth.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.970 align:middle line:10%
Nor did Plato, nor did
Aristotle, nor did Herodotus.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.150 align:middle line:10%
They all believe
Sardinia was Atlantis.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
Atlantis-Sardinia interface

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.480 align:middle line:90%
from your perspective.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: There's a certain
overlap that happens here.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.830 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians basically were
telling Solon the story,

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.080 align:middle line:90%
and Solon gives it to his son.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.400 align:middle line:90%
His son gives it to Plato.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Plato uses the mechanism
of myth in order

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.470 align:middle line:84%
to make sort of a play
out of it in a way

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:90%
that you can remember the story.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.063 align:middle line:84%
And they were in no uncertainty
that the land originally

00:07:59.063 --> 00:08:00.480 align:middle line:84%
was in the middle
of the Atlantic,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.940 align:middle line:90%
which is where it gets its name.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
The same story appears
in the Yucatan as well.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.460 align:middle line:84%
The people of Atel, which
is what they called it.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.560 align:middle line:84%
But what we don't
seem to understand

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.800 align:middle line:84%
is that the empire upon
which Atlantis was based

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:90%
was spread out throughout the--

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.847 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is the key point here

00:08:15.847 --> 00:08:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and where people get confused,
like the Roman Empire.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.420 align:middle line:84%
No, Britain wasn't
Rome, but it did

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.050 align:middle line:84%
have Roman presence, Roman
features, and roads and so

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:23.850 align:middle line:90%
forth.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.310 align:middle line:90%
So let's pick it up from there.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.340 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was what intrigued
me about doing this story,

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.770 align:middle line:84%
because of the
story of the giants

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and even in biblical
texts talking

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.270 align:middle line:84%
about the presence
of giants on Earth

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and giants on Atlantis in
the day, and then the giants

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.590 align:middle line:84%
here in the story that this
was believed to be Atlantis.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.990 align:middle line:84%
This all became the
point of intrigue for me.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.330 align:middle line:84%
So pick it up and talk
about these places

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.400 align:middle line:84%
that the Atlanteans had
outposts, so to speak.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their empire
apparently covered Libya.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.250 align:middle line:10%
Not the country
that we know today,

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.100 align:middle line:10%
but Libya was basically
the whole of North Africa.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.970 align:middle line:10%
It was extended through Menorca
and Mallorca, part of which

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.270 align:middle line:10%
are now sunk as well.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And they also covered
a lot of the territory

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:07.130 align:middle line:84%
around the Mediterranean,
the coastline.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.920 align:middle line:10%
So that essentially-- the
Atlantean empire, according

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.620 align:middle line:10%
to the traditions,
almost abutted

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.610 align:middle line:10%
the Egyptian empire, which
itself is dated about 36,000

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.985 align:middle line:10%
BC, according to
the King List, which

00:09:18.985 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:10%
has written in
the Turin papyrus.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And according to the
hermetics, even further back.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So we're talking about
a very long time, most of which

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.740 align:middle line:84%
has been lost because
of constant catastrophe.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:29.540 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.430 align:middle line:84%
We're looking for things
under the surface,

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:32.930 align:middle line:90%
literally and metaphorically.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So you had this
essence of a concept

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.960 align:middle line:90%
of an influence of an empire.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.358 align:middle line:84%
But what I like to
look at is the myths,

00:09:42.358 --> 00:09:44.150 align:middle line:84%
because the myths are
a wonderful mechanism

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.740 align:middle line:90%
for recording great information.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.830 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand what
the myth is trying to tell you

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:84%
and the language and the
symbology used in the myth.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.308 align:middle line:84%
And once you start
doing that, once you

00:09:53.308 --> 00:09:55.100 align:middle line:84%
start getting into the
nitty gritty of what

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.780 align:middle line:84%
the myth is saying,
you can compare it

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.040 align:middle line:90%
to other parts of the world.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And in Sardinia
especially, there's

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.600 align:middle line:84%
a lot of overlaps with other
stories from other parts

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.990 align:middle line:84%
of the world, and it talks about
this worldwide brotherhood.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:90%
And sisterhood.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.390 align:middle line:84%
There was all-- the
woman was always

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.473 align:middle line:90%
the central issue in this.

00:10:09.473 --> 00:10:13.088 align:middle line:84%
She always held the wisdom
of the entire brotherhood.

00:10:13.088 --> 00:10:14.630 align:middle line:84%
But there were these
groups of people

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.463 align:middle line:84%
who I never thought
were actually connected,

00:10:16.463 --> 00:10:18.020 align:middle line:84%
but it turns out
they all are, which

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.860 align:middle line:84%
is another reason
for writing the book.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.640 align:middle line:84%
It was about showing how
it wasn't just the Anu.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.800 align:middle line:84%
It was also about the
people of the serpent

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.840 align:middle line:84%
and all these other
people who were--

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.200 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the Viracocha,
for example, who were also

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:90%
called the Shining Ones.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, those appear
in the Middle East.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of their traits
appear here in Sardinia as well,

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:37.997 align:middle line:84%
and they're remembered
in the place names.

00:10:37.997 --> 00:10:39.830 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason why
no one can understand

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.690 align:middle line:84%
why they're called
places of the giants

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.060 align:middle line:84%
or the burial
places of the jina.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.610 align:middle line:84%
But those words have a specific
meaning somewhere else,

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and that's how we
unravel the story.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.635 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one
of the features

00:10:50.635 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:84%
is that these are very
large-statured people, anywhere

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.820 align:middle line:84%
up to 10, 12, 13 feet tall,
perhaps even a little taller

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:90%
here in Sardinia.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.660 align:middle line:84%
There's a division that
you make here where

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.130 align:middle line:90%
there are the very tall ones.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Then we start moving
into the giant ones.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And one of the traits
they have in common

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.320 align:middle line:84%
that you mention in your
book, which really piqued me--

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.350 align:middle line:84%
I was reading your book, and
what had already piqued me here

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.890 align:middle line:84%
doing some research were these
large-statured beings that

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:84%
are depicted-- you
can see in Cagliari

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.610 align:middle line:84%
in the museum in
these stone figures

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.610 align:middle line:84%
with these inexplicably
large eyes.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wait a minute.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Freddy's book is talking
about the same thing.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.660 align:middle line:84%
They're depicted with these
large eyes everywhere.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And it occurred
to me that that's

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.800 align:middle line:84%
symbolic for the
ones who can see,

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.140 align:middle line:90%
the ones with sight or vision.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: The awoken one.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:40.320 align:middle line:90%
And we talked about it.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And you said, that's your
same perception on it.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.372 align:middle line:84%
And that goes--
that's actually found

00:11:44.372 --> 00:11:46.010 align:middle line:90%
in the Middle East and Persia.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.470 align:middle line:84%
It goes back, again,
to the lords of Anu

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:90%
who were also the sages.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And the original
name really means

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.010 align:middle line:84%
an enlightened or awoken
person spiritually

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:56.780 align:middle line:90%
and also intellectually.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And the symbol for that
was the eye is wide open.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.115 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're
right here in Sardinia.

00:12:01.115 --> 00:12:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
some of the other places

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.020 align:middle line:84%
that you research in your
book that had these--

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.610 align:middle line:84%
symbolically the people depicted
in the same way as larger

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:11.110 align:middle line:90%
than normal with large eyes.

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in Edfu, if you look at
one of the panels of the Edfu

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.440 align:middle line:84%
text in the Temple
of Edfu in Egypt,

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.540 align:middle line:84%
they actually give
them an actual height.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.225 align:middle line:84%
And depending which
qubit you're using,

00:12:21.225 --> 00:12:23.350 align:middle line:84%
because it could be the
royal or the sacred qubit--

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Since none of
us know what a qubit is,

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.582 align:middle line:84%
just tell us in feet
and inches, or meters.

00:12:26.582 --> 00:12:28.832 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It basically ends
up at eight and a half feet

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:29.890 align:middle line:90%
to 10 feet.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.613 align:middle line:84%
Either way, they're very tall,
which actually synchronizes

00:12:32.613 --> 00:12:34.030 align:middle line:84%
with the size of
the bones that we

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.950 align:middle line:84%
keep finding from
here all the way

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.380 align:middle line:84%
over to Britain in
the giants' graves.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.390 align:middle line:84%
After that, we get
into giant people,

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.383 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the story
gets a little bit confusing

00:12:43.383 --> 00:12:44.800 align:middle line:84%
because we're
talking about people

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:90%
who then interbred with humans.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.190 align:middle line:84%
They became half-human,
half-divine.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was problematic
at the beginning

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.930 align:middle line:84%
because their DNA apparently
didn't match human DNA.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.007 align:middle line:84%
It caused all kinds
of abnormalities.

00:12:56.007 --> 00:12:57.715 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that came from this

00:12:57.715 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:90%
was a giantess statue.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And you hear this in
Sardinia, in Southern Europe,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.402 align:middle line:84%
in India, in Asia, all the
way through Easter Island

00:13:06.402 --> 00:13:07.360 align:middle line:90%
in the Solomon Islands.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I've recently
heard even in Bolivia,

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:90%
although that's not known yet.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.460 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: Yeah, the DNA
tracks all the way back

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.298 align:middle line:10%
to the Black Sea,
oddly enough, which

00:13:14.298 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:10%
is kind of the area,
the general area where

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.745 align:middle line:10%
the Anu used to live.

00:13:17.745 --> 00:13:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So these things are beginning
to converge together.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.078 align:middle line:90%
They're beginning to overlap.

00:13:21.078 --> 00:13:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes the
story kind of compelling

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.390 align:middle line:90%
because there was some kind of--

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the original sort
of watchers of the Anu

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:84%
who were part of the
same group of people,

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.170 align:middle line:84%
they were told not to
intermix with human women

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.940 align:middle line:84%
because there was a
problem with genetics.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And of all people, the
Wichita of Oklahoma

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:84%
still had the story
about saying that when

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:84%
the tall people
intermixed with us,

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.640 align:middle line:90%
the women died in childbirth.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.610 align:middle line:84%
So the babies were born
as the size of infants,

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.140 align:middle line:84%
and that's still
in their memory.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And the Hopi talk
about this as well.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just Sardinia.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.523 align:middle line:90%
It's also all around the world.

00:13:54.523 --> 00:13:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and this
is also in religious texts,

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.330 align:middle line:90%
the talk of giants.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:13:59.650 align:middle line:90%
Even in some--

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.110 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to a girlfriend
before we came here,

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and she said, oh,
that's so interesting.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:06.190 align:middle line:84%
She said, in my
son's Sunday school

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:08.080 align:middle line:84%
they used to teach
that Adam and Eve--

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Adam was 25 feet
tall and Eve was

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.160 align:middle line:90%
23 feet tall in her Christian--

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.735 align:middle line:90%
Christian Sunday school.

00:14:13.735 --> 00:14:14.573 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: [LAUGHS]

00:14:14.573 --> 00:14:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As a matter
of fact, to little five,

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:17.830 align:middle line:90%
six, seven-year-olds, right?

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And they'll accept
it, no problem.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you become
an adult, you say, no.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even here
it's so interesting.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.880 align:middle line:84%
It's, we'll ask the Sardinian
people about the giants.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.990 align:middle line:90%
We've come for the giants.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:29.990 align:middle line:90%
And they're, giants?

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.490 align:middle line:84%
All the tombs that
say tomba di giganti.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:36.020 align:middle line:90%
And they'll say, no giants.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:36.820 align:middle line:90%
What giants?

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And where did the
story come from, I wonder?

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the thing is,
it just seems to be obscure.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.242 align:middle line:84%
It's just accepted that these
are called tombs of the giants,

00:14:43.242 --> 00:14:46.390 align:middle line:84%
and the purpose for them to
have existed to begin with

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.900 align:middle line:90%
has faded away long ago.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That understanding.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're
trying to bring back here.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And the nuraghe, which is
the towers of the giants.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And again, you're
kind of baffled

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.080 align:middle line:84%
by why they called it
nuraghe, the Nuragic people.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.460 align:middle line:84%
We hear about this,
but who were they?

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.520 align:middle line:90%
Where did they come from?

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was looking at the
origin of words, which is--

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.630 align:middle line:84%
in the old days they
didn't just make up words.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:08.810 align:middle line:90%
It meant something.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:90%
It was describing something.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.958 align:middle line:84%
And I had to go through
all these old languages

00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the Mediterranean.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Libya, Algeria, and
eventually ended up in Malta.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.550 align:middle line:10%
And the word actually
exists in Malta,

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:24.160 align:middle line:10%
that nuraghe actually means
a wise or justful person,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.490 align:middle line:10%
a rightful person.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:26.920 align:middle line:90%
In other words, a wisdom keeper.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.860 align:middle line:84%
So the towers of these
tall people, the giants

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.010 align:middle line:84%
were the towers or the places
where the tall wisdom keepers

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:33.850 align:middle line:90%
used to live.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.860 align:middle line:90%
So they were places of assembly.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, that changes the
story considerably

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.390 align:middle line:84%
because we have the
parallel story somewhere

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.960 align:middle line:84%
in Asia Minor with the original
version of the Book of Enoch

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.595 align:middle line:84%
that talks about the
assembly of the Anu, which

00:15:46.595 --> 00:15:48.220 align:middle line:84%
is in these towers
which are all shaped

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.498 align:middle line:90%
like beehives on the inside.

00:15:49.498 --> 00:15:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And you see them all around
the world, the same towers.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to take
an amazing tour of these.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:55.690 align:middle line:84%
We're taking everybody with
us in a few minutes here.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, yeah.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:57.580 align:middle line:90%
This is the fun part.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:58.780 align:middle line:90%
And Luigi-- yes.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And Luigi's talking
about this as well,

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:05.350 align:middle line:84%
that in his understanding of
it through his family lineage

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:09.970 align:middle line:84%
that it these beings who came
and helped assemble the towers.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And then the
structures that were

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.080 align:middle line:84%
built around them, most
of which have fallen away

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.780 align:middle line:84%
and are just rubble now,
were built for the people

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:84%
where the ceremonies
happen inside

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:20.823 align:middle line:84%
for the builders
of the mountains.

00:16:20.823 --> 00:16:22.990 align:middle line:84%
But there's this twist to
that we'll get to a little

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:24.340 align:middle line:90%
later as well.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.400 align:middle line:84%
So now who are you seeing
the builders to be?

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.250 align:middle line:84%
The Shining Ones,
the same ones that

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:33.070 align:middle line:84%
have come to these various
places around the Earth

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.110 align:middle line:90%
pre-deluge, right?

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Antediluvian times when
let's just stick with the--

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:42.520 align:middle line:84%
I like the convenience of it,
so let's stick with the Atlantis

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:84%
story for a moment
as a starting place

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.450 align:middle line:84%
because we're going
to go all over.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was known in the
day there were people

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.040 align:middle line:90%
that had vision and sight.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.800 align:middle line:84%
It was known that these
catastrophes were happening

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.210 align:middle line:90%
and were going to be occurring.

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:90%
They had foreknowledge of it.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.610 align:middle line:84%
There were people that were
able to reposition themselves

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:84%
to be of service once
this deluge occurred,

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:07.089 align:middle line:84%
to be able to replant knowledge
into civilization again

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:09.520 align:middle line:84%
and help raise civilization a
little faster than if people

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.220 align:middle line:84%
were just left struggling
in caves, right?

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And so we have that, and then
we also have survivors, right?

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.569 align:middle line:84%
Living in outposts
around the world.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's say it's a
combination of the two.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.450 align:middle line:84%
The people of knowledge, are
these the ones that you're

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.040 align:middle line:90%
calling here the nuraghe?

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.095 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, every indication
is that they

00:17:28.095 --> 00:17:30.220 align:middle line:84%
are the same people that
we find in the Middle East

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and also in Easter Island, in
South America, and Yucatan.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.380 align:middle line:90%
All around the world.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.190 align:middle line:90%
They have the same methodology.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:37.570 align:middle line:90%
They're master astronomers.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:90%
They're great navigators.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mathematicians.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:40.570 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Mathematicians.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:45.130 align:middle line:84%
They totally understand the laws
of nature, how to bend them.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.963 align:middle line:84%
You hear this again
and again and again.

00:17:46.963 --> 00:17:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So if people weren't
getting around much back,

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.203 align:middle line:84%
you know, 15,000
years ago, I wonder

00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:53.620 align:middle line:84%
where these stories came from
that are completely similar.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
sophisticated-- yes,

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and sophisticated
agricultural practices,

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.292 align:middle line:84%
which were necessary
to rebuild cultures.

00:17:59.292 --> 00:18:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And suddenly
from that point on,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.208 align:middle line:84%
where were these people that
appear in the narrative?

00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And the Mesopotamian
narrative is

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:84%
where we get most of
the information from,

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.710 align:middle line:84%
which is the narrative that
the Sumerians borrowed that was

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:09.910 align:middle line:90%
borrowed by the Babylonians--

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where
everything keeps get hung--

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:12.558 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: The biblical people.

00:18:12.558 --> 00:18:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
confused by dogma.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.900 align:middle line:84%
But if you go back to
the origin of things,

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:84%
they talk about there was a
civilization that ran parallel

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.530 align:middle line:84%
with hunter gatherers, and
it was they who drip feed

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:27.130 align:middle line:84%
knowledge to the humans
in a way that doesn't--

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.620 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of concurrent with
their level of understanding,

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.840 align:middle line:84%
because if you give
advanced knowledge to people

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.870 align:middle line:84%
who were working on a
rudimentary basis, what happens

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.660 align:middle line:84%
is that when you have ignorance
with advanced knowledge,

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.030 align:middle line:84%
the two make very
strange bedfellows.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.110 align:middle line:90%
Things can go very wrong.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Information is
bastardized really quickly.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that's
what happened.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.300 align:middle line:84%
This is why the watchers
and the Anunnaki

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.840 align:middle line:84%
gets a really bad name, but
that's not how the story was.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.127 align:middle line:90%
These people were teachers.

00:18:51.127 --> 00:18:52.960 align:middle line:84%
They were slow-- they
were looking at humans

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and they're saying,
well, we want

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.020 align:middle line:84%
to stay away from them because
we know much more than they do,

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.490 align:middle line:84%
which is a whole
story in itself.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.690 align:middle line:84%
But once in a while they would
say, go down and just teach

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:04.130 align:middle line:84%
them how to grow crop,
domesticate wheat or something

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:05.380 align:middle line:90%
like that, and then come back.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Just feed that into them
and see where that goes.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we start getting

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.790 align:middle line:84%
the story of the civilization of
humanity from hunter gatherers

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:84%
into people who were
creating communities.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.523 align:middle line:84%
It happened suddenly
all around the world.

00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and it has
been depicted artistically

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:20.490 align:middle line:90%
in the novels.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.180 align:middle line:10%
For example, "Clan
of the Cave Bears."

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.300 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about the
concurrent existence

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.880 align:middle line:10%
of these two cultures, very
diverse cultures in terms

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:10%
of knowledge and influence.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Nordic-looking, you
would say, right?

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Caucasian.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.095 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, Caucasian.

00:19:32.095 --> 00:19:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Which looks a
bit weird in Polynesia.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.420 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is
in your book, all

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.450 align:middle line:84%
of these-- in all of
these naval civilizations

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.540 align:middle line:84%
where humanity was
reseeded with knowledge,

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.610 align:middle line:84%
the beings that
show up are tall.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Not only do they have big eyes.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:90%
They're fair-skinned.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And the hair is normally
from blond to auburn

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.045 align:middle line:90%
and a phase of red in between.

00:19:55.045 --> 00:19:56.545 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: A lot of
red hair in there.

00:19:56.545 --> 00:19:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
you also said--

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Green eyes, blue eyes.

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Green and
blue eyes, pale eyes.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Now how does this match up
with the Anu, for example?

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.410 align:middle line:84%
How does that match up
with the Atlantean beings

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.813 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about?

00:20:09.813 --> 00:20:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It matches up
perfectly because if you go--

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:84%
one of the things I like doing
is traveling around the world

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.847 align:middle line:84%
to strange places and asking
local people, what do you know?

00:20:17.847 --> 00:20:19.180 align:middle line:90%
What did your parents teach you?

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.290 align:middle line:84%
What did your
grandparents teach you?

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And what did your
predecessors write about?

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:23.860 align:middle line:90%
And the stories all line up.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.850 align:middle line:90%
They all overlap.

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And there are always
tall people who

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.850 align:middle line:84%
were sages, who
were astronomers,

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:84%
who got around flying
through the air almost.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:32.950 align:middle line:90%
Ships with no oars.

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Ships with no
oars and flying shields.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:35.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking, hmm.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:39.280 align:middle line:10%
Someone knew about anti-gravity
and the rocks moving

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.820 align:middle line:10%
to build the temples overnight
to the voice of a command

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.858 align:middle line:10%
or a tone from a trumpet.

00:20:44.858 --> 00:20:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Acoustic frequencies.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:47.820 align:middle line:90%
So these are the same people.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm fascinated
about the whole story,

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.820 align:middle line:84%
that we're not talking
about individual portions

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.120 align:middle line:90%
of civilization.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Every culture on the
face of the Earth

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.610 align:middle line:84%
talks about having a
parallel civilization,

00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:59.260 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't
unnerved by them.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:03.222 align:middle line:84%
They said they were human-like,
but they're not quite human.

00:21:03.222 --> 00:21:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't alien
either apparently,

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.447 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise they
would have come up and said,

00:21:07.447 --> 00:21:09.280 align:middle line:84%
well, we feel very
unnerved by these people.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.080 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.680 align:middle line:84%
All of these storytellers
who are humans,

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.230 align:middle line:90%
they were not unnerved by them.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.248 align:middle line:84%
They just said that they
didn't look like us.

00:21:16.248 --> 00:21:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons that they
call them the Shining People

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.248 align:middle line:84%
or the Shining Ones
is because they

00:21:20.248 --> 00:21:22.570 align:middle line:84%
had to keep smearing
this oil on their skin

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:24.250 align:middle line:84%
as though they
felt uncomfortable

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.895 align:middle line:84%
being here on Earth
with the sunlight.

00:21:25.895 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:84%
There was something
unusual about that,

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.200 align:middle line:90%
and that stuck with me.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And also the fact that they had
this wonderful smell of myrrh

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.310 align:middle line:90%
about them.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:34.900 align:middle line:90%
They dressed in long tunics.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And you get the same
story in Central America

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.130 align:middle line:84%
and South America as you would
do here in the Mediterranean.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's what got my
attention, that we're

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
same people stretched

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.970 align:middle line:84%
around the world in specific
and strategic locations

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:48.770 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:52.630 align:middle line:84%
It was from there that we get
the stories of the one sage

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.350 align:middle line:84%
with the seven groups of
Shining People, the seven sages.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.298 align:middle line:84%
There was always a
charismatic leader.

00:21:58.298 --> 00:22:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And this person would have
seven people with them

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.950 align:middle line:84%
who knew one facet of
the knowledge of things.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.100 align:middle line:84%
One of them was the woman, but
she has all the information.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.438 align:middle line:84%
She was the one to
go to for all the--

00:22:08.438 --> 00:22:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She was the database.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.040 align:middle line:90%
She consolidated it all.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.570 align:middle line:90%
Women are used to multitasking.

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:14.557 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:22:14.557 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They don't get
much attention in history,

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.450 align:middle line:84%
but when they do, they
get the central position.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And just to lay a
little more background here,

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.510 align:middle line:84%
just in doing some
early research in this,

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:28.360 align:middle line:84%
it mentioned that
there were remnants

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.520 align:middle line:84%
of human civilization
on Sardinia

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.580 align:middle line:84%
they've dated back to
at least 350,000 years.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.320 align:middle line:90%
So that's true here too.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's just with little
shards of tools, and so forth.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And as it becomes
more sophisticated,

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.600 align:middle line:84%
that's when we start looking
more toward modern time.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, not-- what they say
is 5,000 years ago, 4,000

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.768 align:middle line:90%
years ago, you're predating.

00:22:49.768 --> 00:22:51.310 align:middle line:84%
You're predating
that by quite a bit.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So relatively still modern
history after the great flood.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's time that we
go out to the nuraghe and show

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.810 align:middle line:84%
everybody what
we've been exploring

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:02.840 align:middle line:90%
for the last few days.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, yes.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First of
all, we need to let

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:84%
everybody know we
went to the north

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.370 align:middle line:84%
because you found a very
specific alignment which

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:13.600 align:middle line:84%
we will be talking about that's
extremely significant in dating

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.170 align:middle line:90%
these structures, OK?

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, Yes.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:16.770 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:20.620 align:middle line:10%
And so we started off
at Nuraghe Ruju, right?

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.510 align:middle line:10%
Which is part of an
alignment that you're

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.710 align:middle line:10%
going to explain to
us out in the field.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, let's
go to Nuraghe Yuh--

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Ruju.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Ruju.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not Yuhu, Ruju.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:29.732 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: [LAUGHS]

00:23:29.732 --> 00:23:30.532 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:30.532 --> 00:23:33.588 align:middle line:90%

00:23:33.588 --> 00:23:39.390 align:middle line:90%


00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.430 align:middle line:90%
This is spectacular.

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: This may be one
of the original-- what

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.430 align:middle line:84%
they call the fairy rings,
which sounds a bit weird.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:48.810 align:middle line:90%
Goes back to the fae people.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:50.730 align:middle line:84%
That's where the word
fairy comes from.

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it is a supernatural
being in one-- an elemental

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:55.300 align:middle line:90%
being in one culture.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.620 align:middle line:84%
But originally, it was
related to the fae people,

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.070 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom keepers of a
very, very long lineage

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.570 align:middle line:84%
said to be older
than the Egyptians.

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we get
to learn about the Anu

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and the Anunnaki, the
wisdom keepers who became

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.440 align:middle line:84%
called the Apkallu, which
literally means sage.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And they were said to have
governed from places like this.

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.830 align:middle line:84%
They described these
fairy rings where there

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.200 align:middle line:90%
were nine keepers of the ring.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.310 align:middle line:90%
One of them was a woman.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And they were all presided
by one central lord,

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:25.350 align:middle line:84%
and they basically took
charge of all the portions

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:26.220 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.430 align:middle line:90%
And they said they were--

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.880 align:middle line:84%
met in councils into
towers just like this

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.940 align:middle line:84%
that had the beehive shape
in the inside, which it does.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:34.890 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.560 align:middle line:90%


00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.540 align:middle line:90%
This is a beehive.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:40.950 align:middle line:90%
It looks like, what?

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.500 align:middle line:90%
About 15 feet high?

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: A little bit more.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.130 align:middle line:84%
So we're inside an actual
island, if you'd like.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.047 align:middle line:84%
And here, this is
completely out of alignment.

00:24:50.047 --> 00:24:52.463 align:middle line:84%
You think, well, if they were
clever enough to build this,

00:24:52.463 --> 00:24:53.400 align:middle line:90%
why not build it here?

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you stand here and you
just scratch down a little bit,

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.680 align:middle line:84%
it narrows the gap
between the walls,

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.190 align:middle line:84%
so it's aligning to the
actual solstice sunrise

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:05.970 align:middle line:84%
as it appears through
this gap in 6,000 BC.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:09.180 align:middle line:84%
It's the one time the
things just line up.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And that, again, puts us
back into the time frame

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.070 align:middle line:84%
of these wisdom
keepers, and we go back

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:17.580 align:middle line:84%
to the idea of why this place is
called the nuraghe, the towers

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:18.413 align:middle line:90%
of the giants.

00:25:18.413 --> 00:25:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look at the
etymology of the word, which

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:25.590 align:middle line:84%
you can find in Malta, it means
the just or rightful people.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And that was usually
the idea that there

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.550 align:middle line:84%
was some group of
wisdom keepers that

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.910 align:middle line:84%
knew all about the knowledge
about the stars, navigation,

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:35.215 align:middle line:84%
mathematics, how to
bend the laws of nature.

00:25:35.215 --> 00:25:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And you hear this story
all around the world.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not unique to Sardinia.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.680 align:middle line:90%
It's just covered everywhere.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And these were the
places where they would

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:43.320 align:middle line:90%
meet and have their counsel.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.060 align:middle line:84%
But they're also
places where they also

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.670 align:middle line:90%
conduct secret affairs.

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think it's important
to really point out here

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.660 align:middle line:84%
that energetically, whether
it's our remote viewers,

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.870 align:middle line:84%
whether it's each one of
us individually, each time

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.330 align:middle line:84%
we tap into one of
these places, we

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:02.820 align:middle line:84%
could be tapping into
any point in history.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And often, it's
the one that has,

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:84%
as we talked about off
camera, the most dense emotion

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:11.830 align:middle line:84%
or the most recent traumatic
or dense experience.

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know
historically what time we're

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.690 align:middle line:84%
tapping into in
terms of the feeling,

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.550 align:middle line:84%
but they have very
distinct feelings.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
we're all picking up

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.103 align:middle line:90%
a similar feeling in the cave.

00:26:21.103 --> 00:26:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And you
expect that from things

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:24.970 align:middle line:84%
that have been built
for thousands of years.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:27.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they go from being
used as sacred places

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.565 align:middle line:84%
to places of
assembly to hospitals

00:26:29.565 --> 00:26:33.300 align:middle line:84%
to a place of corralling
people during times of war.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And you see the nuraghe
being expanded outwards

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.660 align:middle line:90%
from a central tower.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.670 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
development of the building

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.860 align:middle line:84%
relative to the time and
the purpose for which it

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.520 align:middle line:90%
was needed in those times.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.442 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we get
the story so confused,

00:26:44.442 --> 00:26:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
archaeology starts

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.817 align:middle line:84%
getting very confused
because they accept this

00:26:47.817 --> 00:26:50.160 align:middle line:84%
as being designed as a whole
right from the beginning.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.600 align:middle line:84%
But there's no
development stage.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.975 align:middle line:84%
You have to start
with something.

00:26:52.975 --> 00:26:53.775 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:53.775 --> 00:26:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes these are
built on older nuraghe too.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have
to remember that.

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.183 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you've
pointed this out,

00:26:59.183 --> 00:27:01.750 align:middle line:84%
that the older parts
of these structures,

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:05.220 align:middle line:84%
meaning there's more
underneath in a lot of cases,

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.940 align:middle line:84%
the older they are, the
more refined and the larger

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.490 align:middle line:84%
the stones are, meaning
the higher the civilization

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:12.458 align:middle line:90%
and capability, right?

00:27:12.458 --> 00:27:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Which were completely
opposite to what civilizations

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:15.880 align:middle line:90%
are supposed to do.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.120 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to start
off with rudimentary tools,

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and then you go big
and you get really

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.810 align:middle line:90%
precise and mathematical.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.160 align:middle line:90%
And here we start backwards.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.090 align:middle line:84%
We start up with major masonry,
really megalithic masonry,

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:28.200 align:middle line:90%
beautifully fitted.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely aligned to the
stars, to its placement

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.490 align:middle line:84%
on the landscape and its
positioning on the Earth's

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:36.690 align:middle line:90%
telluric currents as well.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these
places, they sense

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:41.260 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth has
its own web of energy,

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:44.120 align:middle line:84%
which we can now use very
expensive equipment to measure.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.620 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have the money,
you can have dowsing equipment.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.660 align:middle line:84%
The two come up
with the same thing.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:52.720 align:middle line:84%
But they start from a very high
educational and intellectual

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The earliest people.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it gets
worse as it gets older.

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.645 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or you can
say we've evolved a bit.

00:27:57.645 --> 00:27:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And these places appear
to suddenly arrive

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.150 align:middle line:90%
without any precedent.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:06.300 align:middle line:84%
They didn't just build
huts and develop into this.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.682 align:middle line:90%
Just appeared by itself.

00:28:07.682 --> 00:28:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So it must have come
from a foreknowledge

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.800 align:middle line:84%
of something else that was
already a set of precedents.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.675 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:28:12.675 --> 00:28:15.507 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it basically
went downhill from there,

00:28:15.507 --> 00:28:17.340 align:middle line:84%
because if you look
outside of this building

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.810 align:middle line:90%
and many others in Sardinia.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:21.030 align:middle line:84%
It's clear that they
were built on-- again

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and again, they were
reused for other purposes,

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.390 align:middle line:84%
but the construction
gets worse over time.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:26.010 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The stones get
smaller and sloppier.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.347 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So how
about this coiled

00:28:30.347 --> 00:28:32.430 align:middle line:84%
serpent that goes around
this chamber, all the way

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:33.310 align:middle line:90%
to the top?

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:35.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a word for
that in Mesopotamia.

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:38.280 align:middle line:84%
It's called sumer, which is
where Sumerian comes from,

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.830 align:middle line:90%
which means coiled serpent.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And the nickname of these
people, these wisdom keepers,

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.730 align:middle line:90%
was the people of the serpent.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:45.530 align:middle line:90%
So now we know.

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.420 align:middle line:84%
We have a correlation
between a word,

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.730 align:middle line:84%
a structural foundation
of a building,

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and the purpose for
which it was used.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: God,
this is beautiful.

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:56.575 align:middle line:90%
Ha!

00:28:56.575 --> 00:28:57.375 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Wow.

00:28:57.375 --> 00:28:59.950 align:middle line:90%


00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:01.600 align:middle line:90%
So you look at the landscape.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.535 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely
designed landscape.

00:29:03.535 --> 00:29:06.710 align:middle line:84%
There are artificially flattened
mountains all the way around.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:11.545 align:middle line:84%
So if you were here in 6000 BC
after the sun has gone down,

00:29:11.545 --> 00:29:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Orion suddenly appears
above this flattened area

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.340 align:middle line:90%
in the sky, followed shortly--

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So are you saying
they shaved the mountains so you

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.987 align:middle line:90%
could see Orion properly?

00:29:20.987 --> 00:29:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You see the
actual alignment.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.165 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So it must been
an incredible sight,

00:29:25.165 --> 00:29:28.945 align:middle line:84%
watching this incredible
display of Sirius chasing Orion

00:29:28.945 --> 00:29:30.200 align:middle line:90%
through the night.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.173 align:middle line:90%
So it's a lot of work.

00:29:31.173 --> 00:29:32.590 align:middle line:84%
They're obviously
great romantics.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lot of thought.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.700 align:middle line:84%
All to have this wonderful
sense of connection

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.997 align:middle line:84%
to what they call the homeland,
the original homeland.

00:29:38.997 --> 00:29:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell me what
was most striking to you

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.760 align:middle line:90%
about Ruju.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Ruju was extraordinary.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.845 align:middle line:84%
It was like it was left
alone in its essence.

00:29:47.845 --> 00:29:49.100 align:middle line:90%
You just walk in.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think even the
camera crew picked this up.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And you just walk in
and you feel a sense

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.930 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
very coherent about it.

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:58.030 align:middle line:84%
There's an intellectual
coherence, but also

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.060 align:middle line:90%
a sense of power.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.400 align:middle line:90%
A subtle power.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.710 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to show it off.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:middle line:90%
It just is what it is.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a sense of
connection to everything.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.105 align:middle line:84%
It says that you can go
in there and see clearly.

00:30:10.105 --> 00:30:11.980 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to explain
when you're actually not

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.648 align:middle line:84%
there because you're trying to
take a feeling of a landscape

00:30:15.648 --> 00:30:17.440 align:middle line:84%
where you suddenly have
a clear vision of--

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the geometry
and the energy inside

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and the building
materials, the granite,

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:24.520 align:middle line:84%
the silicon embedded in
the granite, all of this

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.583 align:middle line:84%
is conducive to clear
states of consciousness.

00:30:26.583 --> 00:30:28.375 align:middle line:84%
But that's why it was
built the way it was.

00:30:28.375 --> 00:30:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's designed
to musical notation.

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:34.390 align:middle line:84%
The shape and the height ratios
give you a certain relationship

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:36.910 align:middle line:84%
to the energy of place,
and that contributes also

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:39.640 align:middle line:84%
to the feel that you go
in there as a tuning fork.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.410 align:middle line:84%
You're inside the
big tuning fork.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And only a small difference
between a few meters

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.740 align:middle line:84%
between here and there will
create a completely different

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:47.540 align:middle line:90%
feeling.

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.450 align:middle line:84%
The Russians had figured
this out years ago

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.200 align:middle line:84%
when they were looking
at this mumbo jumbo

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and they said, well,
if we build buildings

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:55.000 align:middle line:84%
in the same manner
as these old places,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.590 align:middle line:84%
surely they can
influence people now.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:57.923 align:middle line:90%
And they found actually it does.

00:30:57.923 --> 00:31:00.280 align:middle line:84%
The shape of place
has a definite effect

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.490 align:middle line:90%
on your sense of being.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Which also comes to--
brings us to the point of,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.140 align:middle line:90%
why these rocks?

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Because there was a
lot of local stone,

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.100 align:middle line:84%
but they went a long
way to get volcanic rock

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.010 align:middle line:90%
to build the nuraghe.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:11.080 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of work.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.342 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to shave
this really awkward stone.

00:31:13.342 --> 00:31:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, that has a
lot of iron in it.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.790 align:middle line:90%
It has magnetite in it.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.020 align:middle line:90%
It has a crystal in it.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.800 align:middle line:84%
You put this together, it
creates a big energy edifice.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.080 align:middle line:84%
A piezoelectric effect
is taking place.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It seemed like it was
all granite and volcanic rock.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: In Ruju, absolutely.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:28.260 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And that has its own power, and
it's retained within itself.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.562 align:middle line:84%
So when you go in and interact
with it, your spirit of place

00:31:34.562 --> 00:31:36.520 align:middle line:84%
and your spirit of mind,
the two meld together,

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.600 align:middle line:90%
and you're somewhere else.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:38.820 align:middle line:90%
The age again.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Recap the age of Ruju,
according to your alignments.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Ah, this is where
we get into pottery shards.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And the pottery shard
people will say,

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.110 align:middle line:84%
well, we went to the deep layer
of dirt in the sacred site

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and we found pottery
shards and bones.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.630 align:middle line:90%
We can date those.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:54.580 align:middle line:84%
That's when the
site was built. No.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.100 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to go
and do stuff like this

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.930 align:middle line:84%
and take the time and
the effort to build

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:01.210 align:middle line:84%
these incredible
monuments, you're

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:04.040 align:middle line:84%
not going to let dirt and
broken pottery stay in there.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.060 align:middle line:84%
This tells me the time when
the site was decommissioned

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.830 align:middle line:90%
and dirt starts building up.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:10.375 align:middle line:90%
People will take shelters.

00:32:10.375 --> 00:32:13.630 align:middle line:84%
They break a pot by accident,
and that's what they're dating.

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, well, we agree
with some of the astronomers

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.900 align:middle line:84%
that, yes, the sites were
astronomically significant.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And usually it's the alignment
of the doorways, the position

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.400 align:middle line:90%
of what it was looking at.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say,
yes, we agree that it

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:29.440 align:middle line:84%
was looking at the winter
solstice sunset or the sunrise

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.290 align:middle line:90%
or the equinox 3,500 years ago.

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And you say, OK,
we'll accept that.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.580 align:middle line:84%
But now we have the
technology and the mathematics

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.350 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
project back in time

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:39.833 align:middle line:90%
at any given spot on Earth.

00:32:39.833 --> 00:32:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at this on the
computer and I'm going, no.

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:44.920 align:middle line:84%
The sun 3,000 years
ago was over here.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Once you start
going back this way

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and you start
recalibrating the heavens,

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.610 align:middle line:84%
because the Earth shifts
relative to its background

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:55.960 align:middle line:84%
of stars, one degree every
72 years, things misaligned.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.960 align:middle line:84%
When we get to 6,000 BC
on the winter solstice,

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.450 align:middle line:84%
things begin to take
a very unusual turn.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And not just Ruju,
but three sites

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:05.410 align:middle line:90%
which are also aligned with it.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:08.290 align:middle line:84%
Or should I say, slightly
misaligned to each other.

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at
this and I'm thinking,

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.830 align:middle line:84%
these sites bear a
strong resemblance

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:13.780 align:middle line:90%
to the belt stars of Orion.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And Orion is the
overarching constellation

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.408 align:middle line:84%
in the mythology
of Sardinia, as it

00:33:19.408 --> 00:33:20.950 align:middle line:84%
is in other parts
of the world, which

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:22.825 align:middle line:84%
brings all these people
together, by the way.

00:33:22.825 --> 00:33:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And I began to look at
the alignment of Orion,

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.480 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, 6,000 BC on
the winter solstice, bang.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.050 align:middle line:84%
You have not just the
alignment to the actual tower,

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:35.080 align:middle line:84%
but they've artificially
flattened certain mountains

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.330 align:middle line:84%
to allow for that alignment
to actually take place.

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we can see this.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It was a
huge dramatic theater.

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:43.690 align:middle line:84%
But also Sirius comes up
in the same locations using

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:46.060 align:middle line:84%
the exact same alignments,
and Sirius is always

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.855 align:middle line:84%
associated with wisdom
and knowledge, which

00:33:47.855 --> 00:33:49.480 align:middle line:84%
are the people we're
talking about here

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.920 align:middle line:90%
who built the towers.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.940 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just Ruju.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:56.090 align:middle line:84%
It's also [NON-ENGLISH]
up the road.

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:57.366 align:middle line:90%
And also Antine.

00:33:57.366 --> 00:33:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Antine, which
we'll go to in just a minute.

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:01.558 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Which we'll
go in just a minute.

00:34:01.558 --> 00:34:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And if you actually stood there
at 6,000 BC as an observer,

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.810 align:middle line:84%
you would see all
these three sites

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:10.020 align:middle line:84%
matching the winter solstice
sunrise and its sunsets.

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.929 align:middle line:84%
And after the sunsets
you get Orion and Sirius

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:15.780 align:middle line:84%
following this wonderful
dance across the sky.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And at the mid-heaven you
see it right facing Ruju.

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And then at the sunset,
the setting position,

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.429 align:middle line:90%
we get to Santu Antine.

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And the two hills
again are perfectly

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.909 align:middle line:84%
flattened to allow those
two wonderful constellations

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:32.130 align:middle line:90%
and the star to float into.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:35.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're talking a
huge, huge cosmic display

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.870 align:middle line:84%
of archeaoastronomy,
and that gives you

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:38.520 align:middle line:90%
a pretty good, firm date.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is
approximately 3,000 years

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:middle line:84%
after the great
deluge, societies

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.290 align:middle line:90%
beginning to rebuild again.

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:45.389 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:47.205 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that's just the
stuff that's on the ground.

00:34:47.205 --> 00:34:48.455 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what's below it.

00:34:48.455 --> 00:34:51.900 align:middle line:84%
But just accepting that
as a fact, which brings

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:54.480 align:middle line:90%
up the question of, why Orion?

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.219 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I just
still can't get over

00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:58.890 align:middle line:84%
the notion we're so
lucky that we're here

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:01.500 align:middle line:84%
at a point in history,
we can just wander up.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.590 align:middle line:90%
There's no gatekeeper.

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:03.718 align:middle line:90%
There's no one there.

00:35:03.718 --> 00:35:05.010 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to buy a ticket.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:07.607 align:middle line:84%
But all of these beautiful sites
we went to that we're looking

00:35:07.607 --> 00:35:09.690 align:middle line:84%
at right now-- and we're
going to go to number two

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:10.560 align:middle line:90%
in a moment--

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.010 align:middle line:84%
we just walked up to
unimpeded and crawled inside.

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's hope it stays that way
for people in the future.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.150 align:middle line:10%
So now we go to Oes.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:19.120 align:middle line:10%
Is it called Oes?

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oes.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oes.

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:21.450 align:middle line:90%
We go to Oes.

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You're never sure
in this part of the world.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The language is
always a little bit dodgy.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.218 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We think
it's called Oes.

00:35:25.218 --> 00:35:29.250 align:middle line:84%
But now, this is the only
one I did not go with you to.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:32.750 align:middle line:84%
You went on your own, and we did
just a very brief encapsulation

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:33.550 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:35.760 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about
that particular site.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It was a site I
felt that had been designed

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.740 align:middle line:84%
for a specific purpose and
intention originally, which

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:41.970 align:middle line:90%
then had been expanded.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And something kind
of changed that when

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.443 align:middle line:84%
it was used as a
fortification, which,

00:35:47.443 --> 00:35:49.110 align:middle line:84%
to all intents and
purposes, that's what

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:51.300 align:middle line:90%
appears to have happened here.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.385 align:middle line:84%
There was a feel
of almost dread,

00:35:53.385 --> 00:35:57.760 align:middle line:84%
of anger, of the world
closing in on you.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you're able to project
your consciousness back

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.537 align:middle line:84%
to the time when
it was built, you

00:36:01.537 --> 00:36:04.900 align:middle line:84%
get a sense that, OK, this was
actually a very coherent space.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.740 align:middle line:84%
It was used as a kind of
a mind projection edifice.

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:10.345 align:middle line:84%
But then because
of time and the--

00:36:10.345 --> 00:36:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Human activities.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:11.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:13.728 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --and human
activity, something darker

00:36:13.728 --> 00:36:14.882 align:middle line:90%
was attached to it.

00:36:14.882 --> 00:36:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And everybody kind of felt a
little bit more sort of, well,

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I think I preferred Ruju
up the road to this one,

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:21.720 align:middle line:84%
because there hadn't
been-- it hadn't

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.445 align:middle line:90%
succumbed to human folly.

00:36:23.445 --> 00:36:25.390 align:middle line:84%
It was left by itself
for some reason.

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:27.280 align:middle line:90%
It was very clean.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.140 align:middle line:90%
Very clean energy.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.887 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You sense a palpable
feel between one and the other.

00:36:30.887 --> 00:36:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And any person, normal
person would go up to these

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:35.490 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, but they're all
towers, but no, they're not.

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:37.180 align:middle line:90%
They're all subtly different.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.970 align:middle line:84%
That's why they have
that effect on you.

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.460 align:middle line:10%
I want to take everybody
over to Santu Antine.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Very impressive sight.

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:45.265 align:middle line:90%
Very strange energy.

00:36:45.265 --> 00:36:48.180 align:middle line:84%
I meditated in each of the
places, as I think most of us

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:52.800 align:middle line:84%
did, and received a really
kind of interesting look

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.503 align:middle line:90%
at that one in particular.

00:36:54.503 --> 00:36:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Very much so.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.623 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there was
quite a bit of fear factor,

00:36:57.623 --> 00:36:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and it was very dense, so
I was uncomfortable there.

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And our producer Jason
was uncomfortable there too.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.280 align:middle line:84%
As soon as he walked up,
oh, this place feels creepy.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: [LAUGHS]
We can't have that.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.713 align:middle line:84%
And so-- I mean, and
again, and this-- we're

00:37:08.713 --> 00:37:11.130 align:middle line:84%
going to get to this again
with the remote viewers in just

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.020 align:middle line:90%
a minute with another location.

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.880 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about Santu Antine.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
not the energy of it

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:18.990 align:middle line:84%
that we experience, but
the actual alignments

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:20.032 align:middle line:90%
and the structure itself.

00:37:20.032 --> 00:37:22.854 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:22.854 --> 00:37:25.149 align:middle line:90%


00:37:25.149 --> 00:37:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, this is beautiful
walking in here.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.000 align:middle line:90%
It's gorgeous.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.158 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Very different.

00:37:29.158 --> 00:37:36.330 align:middle line:90%


00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.365 align:middle line:84%
Again, the predominant
constellation

00:37:38.365 --> 00:37:40.800 align:middle line:84%
in this part of the
world was Orion.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And Sirius, which is a
mark of the knowledge,

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:45.060 align:middle line:90%
that people held the knowledge.

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.360 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
how Orion, for example,

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.030 align:middle line:90%
chases a Taurus through the sky.

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And you've got Heracles chasing
the Cretan bull, as well.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:56.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking it sounds
too good to be true,

00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:59.460 align:middle line:84%
that Heracles may be
another variation of Orion

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.330 align:middle line:90%
in one sense.

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:00.870 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that's why he's
so associated with Sardinia.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And he was told, if you want to
join the company of the gods,

00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:09.900 align:middle line:84%
you have to go and literally
take your offspring

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and make them into the
chiefs of Sardinia,

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.160 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it was
called back then.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So we have this establishment
of a half-human, half-divine

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.740 align:middle line:84%
bloodline from the myth
of Sardinia itself.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
primitive stairwell.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, that's a
very good observation.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:24.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:25.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's, like, three--

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:27.705 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --humans, a
normal, average person--

00:38:27.705 --> 00:38:28.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm quite tall.

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:29.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm 6 foot 5".

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Even I am going to have a
little trouble getting--

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, that's like hand
over, trying to climb up there.

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But those steps are
definitely built for people who

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:37.190 align:middle line:90%
were big--

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like you, giants.

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:40.038 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:40.038 --> 00:38:44.223 align:middle line:90%


00:38:44.223 --> 00:38:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: My understanding of
how these sites came together

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.250 align:middle line:84%
is a mirror image on the
ground of the belt of Orion

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:50.920 align:middle line:90%
at that particular era.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to the central
tower of Santu Antine, which

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:54.930 align:middle line:90%
is unusual by itself.

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:58.620 align:middle line:84%
It has a double beehive
chamber, which is extraordinary.

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.620 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen anything
quite like this before.

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And at the bottom one you
have these four alcoves,

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.240 align:middle line:84%
each one aligned to
the compass points,

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.542 align:middle line:84%
as though some very
intellectual exercise

00:39:07.542 --> 00:39:08.750 align:middle line:90%
was being conducted in there.

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:10.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the central
part of the site.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:12.230 align:middle line:84%
That's the original
part of the site.

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.897 align:middle line:84%
Because if you stare
out of the doorway,

00:39:13.897 --> 00:39:15.890 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at a
blank wall and you think,

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:18.020 align:middle line:84%
they would never have
done that because there's

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.300 align:middle line:84%
a light box on top of the
doorway which would allow

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.280 align:middle line:84%
the sunlight of
the winter solstice

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.713 align:middle line:84%
to come flooding
into the chamber.

00:39:23.713 --> 00:39:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Why would you block that
with a wall in front of it?

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you
were picking up as well

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:29.180 align:middle line:84%
was the later stage
where they turned it

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:30.740 align:middle line:90%
into a big fortification.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And now it's like a labyrinth
of corridors and towers.

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, and you can see the
progression from knowledge

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:40.070 align:middle line:84%
to spirituality to
fear, which brings us

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:44.030 align:middle line:84%
into the historic period
of about 1500, 2000 BC.

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:45.800 align:middle line:84%
There were marauding
people on Sardinia

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.930 align:middle line:84%
and now we can establish
that as a fact.

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.382 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All these little
crevices and walkways.

00:39:51.382 --> 00:39:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: These were
built for big people.

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:58.810 align:middle line:90%


00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So Freddy, you've
never seen this

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:05.080 align:middle line:84%
before where the beehive we were
just in, that little chamber we

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:08.650 align:middle line:84%
meditated in for a bit,
we're now standing above it,

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:09.928 align:middle line:90%
and there's a second beehive.

00:40:09.928 --> 00:40:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Short
beehive chamber, which

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:14.020 align:middle line:84%
seems to be about half the
size of the one below it.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And it faces out onto
a beautiful window,

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:18.410 align:middle line:84%
again, with a
light box above it,

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:21.310 align:middle line:84%
which is usually a sign that
it's pointing to a rising

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:25.450 align:middle line:84%
object so that the light comes
in here, hits the alcove,

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:29.627 align:middle line:84%
and that seems to, again,
match the sunrise in 6000 BC.

00:40:29.627 --> 00:40:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But look
at the construction

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:32.825 align:middle line:90%
compared to the one below.

00:40:32.825 --> 00:40:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But here's
the fun part,

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.708 align:middle line:84%
and this is where we have to
do a bit of lateral thinking.

00:40:36.708 --> 00:40:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it was, it
was important enough

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:41.350 align:middle line:84%
to measure some object
rising on the horizon

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:43.840 align:middle line:84%
twice, because you'd
see it here first

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and then you'd go down
to the floor below

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:49.010 align:middle line:90%
and you see it rising up again.

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:50.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's obviously
important enough--

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:53.135 align:middle line:84%
it could have been the fact that
there's two objects rising one

00:40:53.135 --> 00:40:54.100 align:middle line:90%
above the other.

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and it's
also thought in the Sardinian

00:40:56.350 --> 00:41:00.160 align:middle line:84%
history, again, one of the
researchers here that's been

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.340 align:middle line:84%
on it for a lot of years,
Sergio Frau believes--

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and this aligns with some of the
great philosophers of Greece--

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.460 align:middle line:84%
that there was another
deluge that happened where

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:10.840 align:middle line:90%
the coastline was inundated.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And they say the evidence
they found was almost like--

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:15.560 align:middle line:90%
they called it a mud Pompeii.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: [LAUGHS]

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, jewelry,
pots, pieces of pottery

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.260 align:middle line:84%
and dishes all roiled
together in this mud.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So it may have been--
and they believe

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:28.120 align:middle line:84%
that there was a piece
of meteorite that

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.890 align:middle line:84%
crashed into the
environment in the sea,

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and it crashes in-- apparently,
I think they calculate it

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:37.060 align:middle line:84%
at 20 kilometers a second, which
creates quite a tidal wave,

00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:39.520 align:middle line:84%
so the coastal regions
were wiped out again.

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.242 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes, exactly.

00:41:41.242 --> 00:41:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's around 3000
BC, if I'm not mistaken.

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I think
they say around 3100, 3200.

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:50.330 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
guesses was 1175 BC.

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:52.150 align:middle line:90%
It shifted the weather.

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:54.883 align:middle line:90%
It shifted apparently the stars.

00:41:54.883 --> 00:41:57.550 align:middle line:84%
The actual rotation of the Earth
actually stopped for a few days

00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:00.490 align:middle line:84%
because they talk about in
Asia, actually in China,

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:02.170 align:middle line:84%
the sun staying in
the sky for three

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:03.400 align:middle line:90%
days in the same location.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And on the opposite
side of the world,

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:07.480 align:middle line:84%
the moon stayed in the same
location for three days.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.530 align:middle line:90%
Everything stopped.

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And from that moment, we go from
a spiritual concept of the land

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:14.920 align:middle line:84%
to a much more
protective concept.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.295 align:middle line:84%
People are now
working with fear.

00:42:16.295 --> 00:42:17.795 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
working with fear.

00:42:17.795 --> 00:42:20.350 align:middle line:84%
They're hiding anywhere they
can just to sustain themselves.

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:21.767 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that's
when you begin

00:42:21.767 --> 00:42:23.770 align:middle line:84%
to adapt the old sites
to a protective state.

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And we see that in Northern
Europe as well in England,

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:26.920 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge goes from being one
circle to being two circles.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.190 align:middle line:84%
They began to re-adapt
the sacred sites

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:34.730 align:middle line:84%
to the new alignments
in the sky.

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's been played
out here as well.

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And yes, there was a comet
that hit the Mediterranean,

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and it did create
a lot of havoc.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And it wiped out-- it
was also responsible

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:45.550 align:middle line:84%
for wiping out part of the
Bronze Age culture later.

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:49.150 align:middle line:84%
There's another event that
happened later on after that.

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:51.020 align:middle line:84%
We live in a very
volatile solar system.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:52.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the
ancients kept saying

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.610 align:middle line:84%
that in no way are
the-- actually,

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:57.520 align:middle line:84%
this is a direct quote
from the Chinese.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.160 align:middle line:84%
In no way are the orbits
of the planets fixed.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Once in a while, things come
from outside the solar system

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:05.350 align:middle line:84%
and it hits the planets,
shakes them off their orbits,

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and then it influences us,
and things hit us as well.

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:12.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've had 13 cataclysms
since the flood in 9700 BC.

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:15.200 align:middle line:84%
So we live in fairly
interesting times all the time.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think sometimes
when people hear this,

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.180 align:middle line:84%
it gives a sense of
futility to being human.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:23.560 align:middle line:90%
It's like, this isn't fair.

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.700 align:middle line:90%
We build it up.

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's like
watching someone smash

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.750 align:middle line:84%
some little kid's sandcastle
and you start all over again,

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:30.940 align:middle line:90%
except with no memory--

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.280 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about that in a
little bit-- with no memory,

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.360 align:middle line:84%
starting again and
again and again.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.300 align:middle line:90%
So this happened once again.

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:40.313 align:middle line:84%
But there are these
markers of consistency.

00:43:40.313 --> 00:43:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So the whole point
of this is that there

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:44.692 align:middle line:84%
was an advanced civilization
that originally settled it,

00:43:44.692 --> 00:43:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and many of these
nuraghe have been

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:49.760 align:middle line:84%
built upon by subsequent
invaders, colonizers,

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.560 align:middle line:90%
and so forth?

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:51.820 align:middle line:90%
It's been adapted.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:53.278 align:middle line:84%
You can look at
all the stuff here.

00:43:53.278 --> 00:43:56.440 align:middle line:84%
This was all adaptation for
habitation much, much later.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Again, when you have a site
that's 8,000 years old,

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.850 align:middle line:84%
it's going to go through
a lot of changes,

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:01.840 align:middle line:90%
a lot of adaptations.

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.882 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it where
things have been adapted

00:44:03.882 --> 00:44:05.380 align:middle line:90%
that don't quite make sense.

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:07.000 align:middle line:90%
It's more utilitarian.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.780 align:middle line:84%
The rest of it's simply much
more astronomically aligned.

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:13.900 align:middle line:84%
It's much more purposeful in
terms of a spiritual context.

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And that wouldn't serve
people who were being raided.

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:19.270 align:middle line:84%
We're now talking
about 1,500 BC where

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:20.890 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of
raiding going on

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:23.050 align:middle line:84%
in Sardinia, so
it follows nicely

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:24.220 align:middle line:90%
with the historical track.

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Indeed.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:30.700 align:middle line:84%
So as random and
inconsistent, the effect

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:33.070 align:middle line:84%
it has on this species,
this amnesiac sense

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:35.890 align:middle line:84%
of having to drag ourselves
up and start over, again,

00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:39.850 align:middle line:84%
all over the world, there are
some markers of consistency.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And it always seems to point
back, as we mentioned earlier,

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:46.010 align:middle line:84%
in these-- at least these
sacred sites around the world

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:46.810 align:middle line:90%
to Orion.

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:47.650 align:middle line:90%
Why Orion?

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:51.813 align:middle line:84%
What's the significance of
Orion to this planet and to us?

00:44:51.813 --> 00:44:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That was
the big question

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I was asking for
the book project,

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and that was, why do all the
cultures around the Earth

00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.870 align:middle line:90%
talk about Orion?

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:00.160 align:middle line:90%
What is the significance?

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yeah, we look out of
the sky on a balcony and we go,

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:03.610 align:middle line:90%
there's Orion.

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:06.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a pretty--
it's in your face.

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.560 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
why are they

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.650 align:middle line:84%
so adamant about it being
the half of the universe,

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:14.050 align:middle line:84%
the light of heaven,
the light of the sky,

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:14.955 align:middle line:90%
a point of creation?

00:45:14.955 --> 00:45:16.330 align:middle line:84%
It depends who
you're talking to.

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:17.622 align:middle line:90%
They talk about the same thing.

00:45:17.622 --> 00:45:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that one of
the original sages of the Anu

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:22.960 align:middle line:90%
was called Uanna.

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:24.550 align:middle line:90%
That's where Orion comes from.

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Orion is a Greek
translation of Sumerian.

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So Uanna was actually one of
the main priests, the magician

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:35.260 align:middle line:90%
priests of the people of Anu.

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Which brings us back again to
Sardinia and the tall people.

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:38.950 align:middle line:90%
And they were very tall.

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:40.420 align:middle line:90%
There were seven sages.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And that these were the people
that basically come from this--

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.610 align:middle line:84%
they either come
from Orion, or they

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:47.590 align:middle line:84%
have a spiritual
connection to Orion,

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:49.900 align:middle line:84%
or they found the way
to go from the physical

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.000 align:middle line:90%
to the spiritual in Orion.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.712 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's the same story
overlapping around the world.

00:45:54.712 --> 00:45:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And the more I talk
to Indigenous people,

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.270 align:middle line:84%
the more they say
actually, it's all three.

00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:01.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a metaphor, a symbol,
and back in the day

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:03.100 align:middle line:84%
they could go
backwards and forwards

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.350 align:middle line:84%
in this sort of portal,
this tube they called it

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:06.520 align:middle line:90%
between the stars.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And they go there
because they could.

00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:11.560 align:middle line:84%
They had this understanding
of the laws of nature,

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.190 align:middle line:90%
which sounds strange to us.

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:15.970 align:middle line:84%
But when you hear this again
and again around the world

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:18.580 align:middle line:84%
and you see that these people
were human-like and yet

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.620 align:middle line:84%
not quite human,
you begin to wonder,

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:24.280 align:middle line:84%
was this perhaps something to
do with a group of people that

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.530 align:middle line:84%
were either stationed
here, were dropped here,

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:28.970 align:middle line:84%
or were left here from
a long, long time ago?

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:31.552 align:middle line:84%
Which in my mind
suggests this is

00:46:31.552 --> 00:46:33.010 align:middle line:84%
why they didn't
want to communicate

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:34.570 align:middle line:90%
with humans that much.

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:38.268 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to be a society
aside from human people.

00:46:38.268 --> 00:46:40.060 align:middle line:84%
They had a complete
different understanding

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:41.410 align:middle line:90%
to hunter gatherers.

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And in order to live here in
harmony with human beings,

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:46.510 align:middle line:84%
they had to divulge the
information that they

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:48.910 align:middle line:90%
had, slowly drip feeding it.

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And we see the vestiges
of their culture

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:56.110 align:middle line:84%
in the words, the deeds, the
mythology, and also the things

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:57.820 align:middle line:84%
that they built,
because wherever

00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:00.460 align:middle line:84%
you go from whether it's
the Mediterranean all

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.590 align:middle line:84%
the way to Central
America or South America,

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:04.120 align:middle line:84%
the same construction
technology.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same people that
are doing it all the time.

00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:08.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's why Orion
was important.

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.950 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be a creative point
in the center of the universe

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:13.960 align:middle line:84%
that all Indigenous
people go back to again

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.293 align:middle line:90%
and again and again.

00:47:15.293 --> 00:47:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And now I'll tell you another
a little bit of esoterica.

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Two unrelated sources
were sharing with me

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.880 align:middle line:84%
the journey of the watchers
in different times,

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.240 align:middle line:90%
different interviews, and such.

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was
saying that the people--

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:31.420 align:middle line:84%
these beings, these
nonphysical beings

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.490 align:middle line:84%
went through a process
of densification

00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:35.810 align:middle line:84%
in order to be of service
wherever they were.

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And one of them--
before coming to Earth,

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:40.450 align:middle line:84%
one of the trajectories
was considered

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:44.290 align:middle line:84%
to be from the Crab
Nebula through to Orion,

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:46.120 align:middle line:90%
to Sirius, Venus, Earth.

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And this was the trajectory,
becoming more and more and more

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:53.107 align:middle line:84%
third dimensional in the process
to be able to be in this given

00:47:53.107 --> 00:47:54.940 align:middle line:84%
place-- and I'm sure
there are many others--

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:58.090 align:middle line:84%
to be able to hold energies,
hold knowledge, and be

00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:00.470 align:middle line:90%
of service when help was needed.

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Which is the journey
of the watchers.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that's
something that

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.320 align:middle line:84%
pops up again in traditions
all around the world.

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:08.250 align:middle line:84%
The watchers could take on human
form "whenever they wanted,"

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:09.130 align:middle line:90%
quote.

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But not easily.

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Not easily.

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.197 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
a good time here.

00:48:12.197 --> 00:48:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very, very
difficult for their being.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:16.345 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They had to
have the tall structure.

00:48:16.345 --> 00:48:18.130 align:middle line:10%
They had the elongated
skulls, which

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:21.610 align:middle line:10%
we find in Sardinia and in other
pinch points around the world.

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:23.380 align:middle line:10%
They had the red hair.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.240 align:middle line:10%
But they said, we
had a hard time

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.130 align:middle line:10%
being here because it was such
a physical, dense dimension.

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So for
anyone who understands

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:33.580 align:middle line:84%
molecular structures and the
mechanics of nature, for them

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:38.080 align:middle line:84%
it was easy as you and I going
shopping to buy a bowl of soup.

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.783 align:middle line:84%
They could just bend
nature like that

00:48:39.783 --> 00:48:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and they could be in
two places at once.

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly it makes
sense, because again,

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.900 align:middle line:84%
if these people 10,000,
11,000 years ago,

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:49.000 align:middle line:84%
if they weren't
communicating with each other

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.550 align:middle line:84%
according to
Orthodox belief, how

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:54.010 align:middle line:84%
is it that the stories
overlap, and in some cases are

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:55.070 align:middle line:90%
practically identical?

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They had to come
from a central source,

00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.440 align:middle line:84%
and everybody was
sharing the same story,

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and they were all in contact
with the same people.

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what fascinates
me, the fact that we do

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:07.510 align:middle line:84%
have a parallel civilization
working with humans,

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and this is why humans were
not really afraid of them.

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:12.160 align:middle line:84%
They felt them to
be very helpful.

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And after the deluge,
there were groups

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:17.260 align:middle line:84%
which came-- appeared
suddenly all around the world

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:19.150 align:middle line:90%
at strategic points.

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Seven people, seven sages.

00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:21.550 align:middle line:90%
One was a woman.

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And there was an eighth central
figure with the large eyes,

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:27.430 align:middle line:84%
and he was married to
this woman of wisdom

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:29.800 align:middle line:84%
who was also his sister,
which I believe to be a symbol

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:30.130 align:middle line:90%
more than--

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or Isis and Osiris.

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah, Isis and Osiris.

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.900 align:middle line:90%
Viracocha and his wife.

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Even the Waitaha
of New Zealand who

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:39.880 align:middle line:84%
have an oral tradition
spanning 12,000 years,

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.860 align:middle line:84%
they talk about the
same people as well.

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.997 align:middle line:84%
And it was their
charge to then rebuild

00:49:43.997 --> 00:49:45.580 align:middle line:84%
in the names of the
Egyptians-- and it

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:48.680 align:middle line:84%
was the Egyptians-- rebuild
the former world of the gods.

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Rebuild the
temples in the image

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:53.320 align:middle line:90%
from where they had come from.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And this explains why
the temples appear out

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.780 align:middle line:84%
of nowhere, completely
constructed,

00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:00.090 align:middle line:84%
complete mythologies,
complete understanding

00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:02.380 align:middle line:84%
of the laws of physics,
mathematics, astrology,

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.638 align:middle line:90%
and astronomy.

00:50:03.638 --> 00:50:04.680 align:middle line:90%
Where did this come from?

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Unless they were hallucinating,
which I am open to.

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Collectively.

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Collectively.

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:10.650 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
every sixth civilization

00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:14.110 align:middle line:84%
arrives prepackaged like
IKEA just drops by and says,

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:15.143 align:middle line:90%
OK, here's a temple.

00:50:15.143 --> 00:50:16.560 align:middle line:84%
We've really come
up with a story.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:17.190 align:middle line:90%
Just build it.

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Here are
your furnishings.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:19.713 align:middle line:90%
Here are your furnishings.

00:50:19.713 --> 00:50:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And that explained-- suddenly
everything falls into place

00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:25.050 align:middle line:84%
when you recognize that
there was a parallel culture.

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about something else.

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
throw this in before we

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:31.470 align:middle line:84%
go to another one of the sites,
the most famous site here,

00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Barumini But before
that, now we've

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:38.400 align:middle line:84%
just laid down the history
of why Orion is significant.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:41.550 align:middle line:84%
But the giants and the
presence of these people,

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:44.140 align:middle line:84%
let's go to the Solomon
Islands because I found--

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:44.940 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know this.

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:47.760 align:middle line:84%
You told this to us when we were
driving in the car, in the van

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:48.180 align:middle line:90%
yesterday.

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:49.110 align:middle line:90%
This is fascinating.

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yes, I had no
intention of talking

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.557 align:middle line:90%
about giants in the book.

00:50:52.557 --> 00:50:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You talked
about it several times.

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's
why I kept saying,

00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Freddy, we need
to do this thing.

00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:59.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because it was
a whole story in itself.

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:03.480 align:middle line:84%
There's tall people and
then there's giant people.

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And the more I kept
reading about the stories--

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:07.180 align:middle line:84%
again, starting
with New Zealand,

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:09.763 align:middle line:84%
which, hardly anyone knows about
the prehistory of New Zealand

00:51:09.763 --> 00:51:12.030 align:middle line:84%
apart from this group of
people called the Waitaha.

00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And they said every year when we
used to live in Easter Island,

00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:18.663 align:middle line:84%
11,000 years ago before the
flood, the gods used to come

00:51:18.663 --> 00:51:19.830 align:middle line:90%
around and hang out with us.

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And they were very tall, very
puissant, beautiful people.

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:24.023 align:middle line:90%
Light skins.

00:51:24.023 --> 00:51:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
that's thought to be

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:29.350 align:middle line:84%
the remaining-- the remnant
of Lemuria, Easter Island is.

00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead--
so again, we just

00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:32.910 align:middle line:84%
start looking at some of
the migration patterns.

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:34.440 align:middle line:90%
And they were everywhere.

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And they got around easily
as you and I go shopping

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.700 align:middle line:84%
at the supermarket
because they used

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.800 align:middle line:84%
mostly catamarans from
what I understand.

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.970 align:middle line:90%
Massive ships.

00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:44.700 align:middle line:84%
People in Tonga still
build them the same way.

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And they basically set up
bases in strategic part

00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:51.510 align:middle line:84%
of the world, which became known
as the birthplaces of the gods

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:54.150 align:middle line:84%
or the navel of the
Earth, and so forth.

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you
go to these places,

00:51:55.750 --> 00:52:00.160 align:middle line:84%
you do see a sudden flowering of
civilization, megalithic temple

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:00.960 align:middle line:90%
building.

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And the knowledge which
forms the foundation

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.720 align:middle line:84%
of all civilization
spreads out like ripples

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:09.690 align:middle line:84%
in a pond to all the people
that come within their vicinity.

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
humans start developing

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:14.640 align:middle line:84%
that sense of community
and agriculture

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.460 align:middle line:84%
and starts developing
there then in turn.

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the gods
were so appreciated.

00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:21.810 align:middle line:84%
They took them out
of a big problem

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:24.000 align:middle line:84%
where everybody's living
in barbaric states

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.450 align:middle line:84%
after everything's completely
run over by massive waves,

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:30.018 align:middle line:84%
and they gave them the
accouterments of civilization.

00:52:30.018 --> 00:52:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in
the Solomon Islands,

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:33.377 align:middle line:90%
we're not speaking past tense.

00:52:33.377 --> 00:52:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: We're still talking
in the present tense.

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about these beings

00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:40.340 align:middle line:84%
and some of your
odd experiences.

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: [LAUGHS]

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is fascinating.

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:43.530 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about it?

00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the
Solomon Islands,

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:51.120 align:middle line:84%
I found that in the Polynesia
area there's a lot of stories

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:55.080 align:middle line:84%
going back into the '50s and
the 1920s of ordinary people,

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:56.760 align:middle line:90%
a young child going--

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.940 align:middle line:84%
walking in the beach and coming
across a massive skeleton.

00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:01.590 align:middle line:90%
The flesh is still attached.

00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:02.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's not a whale.

00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:03.570 align:middle line:90%
It's not a dolphin.

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:05.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a human being.

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:06.730 align:middle line:90%
And a couple of them stand out.

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:08.580 align:middle line:90%
One of them was 18 feet tall.

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:11.358 align:middle line:84%
And there was a record of it
where a flatbed truck comes

00:53:11.358 --> 00:53:12.900 align:middle line:84%
over from the local
counsel, picks up

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:16.170 align:middle line:84%
this massive person,
red hair still attached.

00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:18.038 align:middle line:84%
They put him on the
back of the truck,

00:53:18.038 --> 00:53:19.830 align:middle line:84%
and that's the last
time you hear about it.

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:21.150 align:middle line:90%
Official secrets act, boom.

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Stamped.

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:24.270 align:middle line:84%
They always disappear,
all over the world.

00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:27.540 align:middle line:84%
America's one of the
worst at spiriting away

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:30.390 align:middle line:84%
the giants that are in all of
these Native American lands

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:33.400 align:middle line:84%
around the country, including
California, Nevada, Arizona,

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:36.270 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and of course,
the Midwest, the famous ones

00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:37.710 align:middle line:90%
in Ohio, Michigan.

00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:39.335 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: No different
to anywhere else.

00:53:39.335 --> 00:53:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Every country
takes these bones.

00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Some official organization
or institution

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.340 align:middle line:90%
comes and gets them.

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:45.990 align:middle line:90%
You never hear about it again.

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:49.088 align:middle line:84%
But they're still present,
so this is interesting.

00:53:49.088 --> 00:53:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Solomon Islands.

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And in the Second World War
when the US Navy personnel was

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:56.520 align:middle line:84%
stationed there, they said,
we all slept with a revolver

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:57.930 align:middle line:90%
under the pillow.

00:53:57.930 --> 00:54:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, that
sounds quite right if you're

00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:03.077 align:middle line:84%
expecting a Japanese military
person to come by with a gun.

00:54:03.077 --> 00:54:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Of course, you want to be ready.

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:06.660 align:middle line:84%
But said, no, that wasn't
why we kept the revolvers.

00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:09.060 align:middle line:84%
We kept them because
of these really tall

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:12.492 align:middle line:84%
18-foot-tall people, these
giants with massive red hair.

00:54:12.492 --> 00:54:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And the local villagers,
they weren't afraid of them,

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:16.410 align:middle line:84%
but they scared
the hell out of us.

00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Military people
don't talk like that.

00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:19.680 align:middle line:90%
That's why I love these stories.

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And today in the
Solomon Islands,

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:24.270 align:middle line:84%
which are really quite
remote within themselves--

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:27.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of it's forested,
mosquito-infested, tons

00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:29.430 align:middle line:84%
of snakes everywhere,
very mountainous,

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:31.260 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to get
into the interior.

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And the local villagers will
say, well, once in a while

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.303 align:middle line:84%
we'll be driving along
a mountain track.

00:54:35.303 --> 00:54:36.720 align:middle line:84%
The truck will
start off the road.

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:37.860 align:middle line:90%
It rolls over.

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:40.140 align:middle line:84%
We'll have to go back 15
miles to the local village

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:42.090 align:middle line:84%
to get a truck to winch
the whole thing out.

00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:43.590 align:middle line:90%
We go back the following day.

00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:46.590 align:middle line:84%
The truck is back on
the road, upright.

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With its load intact.

00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: With the load intact.

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:51.720 align:middle line:84%
As if a bunch of eggs
have been spilled.

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:53.650 align:middle line:84%
They put the eggs back,
that kind of thing.

00:54:53.650 --> 00:54:54.960 align:middle line:90%
And they said, it's the giants.

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:55.950 align:middle line:90%
They're actually very helpful.

00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:56.760 align:middle line:90%
They're very shy.

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And we leave them alone
and they leave us alone.

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a lovely entendre.

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And they said that they get
from A to B across the Solomon

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Islands through
the tunnels, which

00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:08.160 align:middle line:84%
are made out of the
limestone, which is fine.

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.040 align:middle line:84%
But the tunnels are
self-illuminating.

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:13.363 align:middle line:84%
There's something within
the actual crystal or quartz

00:55:13.363 --> 00:55:14.780 align:middle line:84%
structure or the
mineral structure

00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:17.270 align:middle line:84%
of the rock which allows
them to be self-illuminating.

00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And the other time I found
that story is actually

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:23.480 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible, which was, again,
lifted from the Mesopotamian

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:24.380 align:middle line:90%
tradition.

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:26.210 align:middle line:90%
That's been proven to be true.

00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:29.270 align:middle line:84%
They talk about Yima, who was
like a prototype for Noah.

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And they said that in order
to see inside the ark,

00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:34.010 align:middle line:84%
they had a window which
was-- or a light that

00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:36.420 align:middle line:90%
was self-shining from within.

00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:39.758 align:middle line:84%
So some kind of rock that they
knew that gave a certain light.

00:55:39.758 --> 00:55:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And they said in
the Solomon Islands,

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:44.120 align:middle line:84%
this is how they get around from
A to B through the mountains.

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:45.543 align:middle line:90%
And we're quite happy with them.

00:55:45.543 --> 00:55:47.210 align:middle line:84%
They just want to be
left by themselves.

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love this story.

00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring it back
to Sardinia now.

00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:52.460 align:middle line:84%
We have another of the
nuraghe we want to go to,

00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:53.985 align:middle line:90%
and it's the most famous one.

00:55:53.985 --> 00:55:55.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you look
at it from above,

00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:58.575 align:middle line:84%
it raises a lot of questions
like, who were these people?

00:55:58.575 --> 00:55:59.450 align:middle line:90%
Where were they from?

00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Because this looks almost like
ancient Celtic structures.

00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:06.530 align:middle line:84%
But first of all,
this site, we need

00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:09.680 align:middle line:84%
to just state we had a whole
day scheduled with sites

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.410 align:middle line:90%
in the South of Sardinia, OK?

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:15.020 align:middle line:90%
And we had been OKed.

00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:18.388 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden
the boss comes along.

00:56:18.388 --> 00:56:19.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what he did.

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:20.240 align:middle line:90%
Must have looked around.

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.782 align:middle line:84%
Must have had bad experiences
with American production teams.

00:56:22.782 --> 00:56:23.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:25.250 align:middle line:84%
But all our permits
were canceled.

00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:28.670 align:middle line:84%
All of them, including the
most famous site, Barumini.

00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:31.470 align:middle line:84%
But it was our good luck because
we got something even better.

00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- I believe in
things working out the way

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.330 align:middle line:90%
they're supposed to.

00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So even though we
were grumbling, we thought,

00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:39.500 align:middle line:84%
we can't shoot it,
but we're going

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.810 align:middle line:84%
to go over and at
least as tourists

00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:43.880 align:middle line:90%
take some pictures of this site.

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.050 align:middle line:90%
Look at this from above.

00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:46.940 align:middle line:90%
It's just absolutely incredible.

00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:51.890 align:middle line:84%
But this was the Barumini
nuraghe, the famous Barumini.

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:55.130 align:middle line:10%
Let's just go ahead and touch
on the dating that you had done,

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:56.240 align:middle line:10%
your projections for it.

00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, I was quite
happy with 6000 BC.

00:56:58.310 --> 00:56:59.900 align:middle line:90%
I thought, this is pretty good.

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:02.480 align:middle line:84%
But again, you don't put your
projections into anything.

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:04.970 align:middle line:84%
You've got to let the
information and the evidence

00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:06.480 align:middle line:90%
follow its own course.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it would
be easy to do.

00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at the
alignment of Barumini

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.120 align:middle line:90%
and I thought, wait a minute.

00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:13.982 align:middle line:84%
This is just going
off towards the south.

00:57:13.982 --> 00:57:15.440 align:middle line:84%
The alignment is
towards the south.

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:19.158 align:middle line:84%
What the hell could be aligned
towards the south at that era?

00:57:19.158 --> 00:57:20.450 align:middle line:90%
And of course, nothing matches.

00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:23.370 align:middle line:84%
There's no connection to
sunrises or moonrises,

00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:26.630 align:middle line:84%
which is usually a safe place
to go with sacred sites.

00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Now we're getting to
7300 BC and the rising

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:32.930 align:middle line:84%
of Orion's belt
over the horizon,

00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:35.143 align:middle line:84%
exactly through a gap in
the distant mountains.

00:57:35.143 --> 00:57:37.310 align:middle line:84%
These things were actually
placed very strategically

00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:39.337 align:middle line:90%
to take the landscape.

00:57:39.337 --> 00:57:40.920 align:middle line:84%
So the landscape
becomes part of the--

00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:41.810 align:middle line:90%
Utilizing the landscape.

00:57:41.810 --> 00:57:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You have to go there
to actually look at the site

00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:46.100 align:middle line:84%
and see what they were
looking at because then it

00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:46.975 align:middle line:90%
makes a lot of sense.

00:57:46.975 --> 00:57:48.737 align:middle line:90%
You can't do this on a computer.

00:57:48.737 --> 00:57:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's what blew
my mind, that there was

00:57:50.570 --> 00:57:52.280 align:middle line:90%
an even earlier culture here.

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're slowly
moving back in time.

00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And the earliest-- the oldest
I ever found here in Sardinia

00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:01.160 align:middle line:90%
was about 7500 so far.

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's over 24
sites I've analyzed,

00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:06.150 align:middle line:90%
and there's thousands of them.

00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So god knows what
else is still to come.

00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:11.360 align:middle line:84%
But it definitely looks
like it's been extended

00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:12.650 align:middle line:90%
from a central tower again.

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:14.300 align:middle line:90%
You get the sense of power.

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:17.300 align:middle line:84%
But then again, you've got all
these other towers and myriad

00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:18.890 align:middle line:84%
of labyrinths that
have been added,

00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:20.000 align:middle line:90%
and that's what we're getting--

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These circles
after circle after circle.

00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:21.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Discombobulated stuff.

00:58:23.330 --> 00:58:25.670 align:middle line:84%
I did feel that, yes, there
was a time there was--

00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:27.860 align:middle line:84%
the place looked like it
was sieged at one point.

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And you get that sense
of siege, of fear.

00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:32.900 align:middle line:84%
People were going to
die of starvation.

00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And I get that at
Teotihuacan as well.

00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:37.070 align:middle line:84%
That's why I never
go to Teotihuacan.

00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:40.895 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to go, but I can't
get over all the sacrifices

00:58:40.895 --> 00:58:42.020 align:middle line:90%
that were being done there.

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:43.850 align:middle line:90%
50,000 people killed in one day.

00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:45.320 align:middle line:90%
I can't get past that.

00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the
remote viewing team

00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:49.220 align:middle line:84%
couldn't get past
the feelings of it.

00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's also take a moment just
to view some of the drawings

00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:56.300 align:middle line:84%
that the remote viewers did
of Barumini in that area.

00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, they did the
same thing about Ruju

00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:01.430 align:middle line:84%
up north and all these
conical structures.

00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:03.470 align:middle line:84%
You can see they
were pretty right on.

00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:05.525 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what Angela
had to say about that.

00:59:05.525 --> 00:59:08.420 align:middle line:84%
She was the one that gave
us the condensed report.

00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:09.985 align:middle line:84%
Angela, hey, it's
so good to see you.

00:59:09.985 --> 00:59:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ANGELA THOMPSON:
It's very nice

00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.100 align:middle line:84%
to be here and meet
you again, Regina.

00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in a 16th century
hotel room in Sardinia

00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:19.890 align:middle line:90%
and open rafters all around me.

00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:21.427 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad we
have Wi-Fi signal.

00:59:21.427 --> 00:59:22.760 align:middle line:90%
There was some concern about it.

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:26.780 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about how
we got together on this

00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:28.850 align:middle line:84%
and what you were
tasked with doing

00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:30.740 align:middle line:84%
as just a little
background for people that

00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:32.360 align:middle line:90%
are looking at this right now.

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: You had mentioned
that there was a project

00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:38.720 align:middle line:84%
that you would like some remote
viewers to look at and send me

00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:43.080 align:middle line:84%
some background information,
some nonleading coordinates, et

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:43.880 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And I sent that out
to six other viewers,

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and then I had two operational
training students that I also

00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:54.530 align:middle line:90%
gave the project to.

00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:58.040 align:middle line:10%
Most of them used
controlled remote viewing,

00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.780 align:middle line:10%
which is a method
that was developed

00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:03.710 align:middle line:10%
by Ingo Swann and Harold Puthoff
at Stanford Research Institute.

01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's a sequential
written and verbal process.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.340 align:middle line:84%
You have a stack of
white paper and a pen,

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:15.080 align:middle line:84%
and you go through a process
accessing more and more

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.520 align:middle line:90%
detailed information.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:19.070 align:middle line:10%
And I was really impressed
with what the viewers had

01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:22.430 align:middle line:10%
got, particularly their
sketches and their descriptions

01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:25.080 align:middle line:10%
of the first two locations.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:28.460 align:middle line:84%
They really did do a
good, credible job.

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
what they perceived

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:33.470 align:middle line:84%
as some of the functions
of these, particularly

01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:36.170 align:middle line:84%
where we're looking at
the clusters of circular--

01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:37.550 align:middle line:90%
stone circles.

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: The
primary function they

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.710 align:middle line:90%
saw was really as a defense.

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:44.660 align:middle line:90%
It was like a fort.

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:46.580 align:middle line:84%
These were for
people to go inside,

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:49.620 align:middle line:90%
to cluster inside if need be.

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:52.370 align:middle line:84%
But there were also
very spiritual aspects,

01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:54.570 align:middle line:90%
that these were perhaps tombs.

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:58.490 align:middle line:84%
They were spiritual temples
almost in some respect.

01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So there was very much
a spiritual aspect

01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:03.710 align:middle line:84%
to the whole-- of
both complexes.

01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And so there were just multiple
uses for these locations.

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:10.500 align:middle line:84%
They weren't like
Stonehenge that

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.293 align:middle line:84%
would have been an
iconic place where

01:01:13.293 --> 01:01:15.210 align:middle line:84%
they went to look at the
sun, moon, and stars,

01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:17.370 align:middle line:90%
although that came up too.

01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That there were
astronomical alignments, yes.

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:21.168 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMPSON:
Astronomical alignment,

01:01:21.168 --> 01:01:22.860 align:middle line:10%
but that wasn't
their sole function.

01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:26.800 align:middle line:10%
They served a very practical
purpose for the people.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And some of them talked
about this energetic use

01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:32.310 align:middle line:84%
that was of a consciousness
that we may not understand

01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:33.570 align:middle line:90%
at this point in time.

01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah.

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.340 align:middle line:84%
So there was more
that was hidden

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:38.400 align:middle line:84%
knowledge, hidden spiritual
knowledge at the site.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's interesting
is these remote viewers aren't

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:43.920 align:middle line:84%
given any information,
not even coordinates.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.880 align:middle line:90%
They get a code.

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then she
knows underneath it

01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:50.280 align:middle line:84%
where the coordinates
are, but they don't know.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.615 align:middle line:84%
They're doing cold
reads, military-style.

01:01:52.615 --> 01:01:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
what you see here.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:57.100 align:middle line:84%
They found they did not
like the feeling of it.

01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, back to what
I was saying earlier,

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Angela's read on it was
these very, very hardy

01:02:02.850 --> 01:02:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and with some knowledge people
had traveled from the north,

01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:08.370 align:middle line:84%
and it almost seemed to
be they were bringing

01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:12.430 align:middle line:84%
a technology with them similar
to the old Saxon ruins and such

01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and these stone
circular walls and such.

01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the notion of
where the people may have come

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.320 align:middle line:84%
from because there
are-- again, it's

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.100 align:middle line:84%
civilization on top
of civilization.

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And the names change over time,
which makes it really difficult

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:29.545 align:middle line:90%
to figure out.

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:31.920 align:middle line:84%
The one that keeps coming up
again and again because it's

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:35.100 align:middle line:84%
one of the few surviving
written stories, which ends up

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:37.320 align:middle line:84%
being the Book of Enoch,
which is-- there's

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.960 align:middle line:84%
a very old version
of that in Ethiopian.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Not that I read
Ethiopian, but if you

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:44.460 align:middle line:84%
want to get the real story
before it becomes Christianized

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:47.970 align:middle line:84%
or Hebrewized, you have to go
back to the origin of the story

01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:49.500 align:middle line:90%
before the politics kicks in.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And the Babylonians said the
same thing about this as well.

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.800 align:middle line:10%
And they seem to be centered
somewhere around the Caucasus

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:58.890 align:middle line:10%
region, somewhere between
the Black Sea and the Caspian

01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:02.490 align:middle line:10%
Sea where ironically, a lot
of the DNA of the skulls

01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:05.370 align:middle line:10%
from Caracas in Peru with
the long heads, their DNA

01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:06.580 align:middle line:10%
goes back to that region.

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:09.330 align:middle line:10%
Well, if we follow some of
the stories from the Egyptians

01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:11.383 align:middle line:10%
and the followers of
Horus who essentially

01:03:11.383 --> 01:03:12.300 align:middle line:10%
were the same people--

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:14.092 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The Shining
Ones, the same group,

01:03:14.092 --> 01:03:16.740 align:middle line:10%
which is the realm of the
sun, the representatives that

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:19.290 align:middle line:10%
come to help from the realm
of the sun into our dimension.

01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:22.595 align:middle line:84%
And they were also
fascinated with Orion.

01:03:22.595 --> 01:03:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
a Roman emperor

01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:26.010 align:middle line:84%
that talks about the
Scythian culture, which comes

01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:27.120 align:middle line:90%
from around the Black Sea.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.370 align:middle line:90%
And he says this offhand remark.

01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:31.083 align:middle line:84%
They're even older
than the Egyptians.

01:03:31.083 --> 01:03:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, this
must be the same people

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.418 align:middle line:90%
called the Anu at one point.

01:03:34.418 --> 01:03:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that
actually, they are.

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:38.640 align:middle line:84%
The Scythians and the
Anu are the same people.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And when they began to
go west through Europe

01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:44.610 align:middle line:84%
as the ice is melting
through Central Europe--

01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:46.710 align:middle line:84%
we're now back at the
end of the Ice Age--

01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:49.350 align:middle line:84%
they start giving the
names to the places.

01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:51.760 align:middle line:90%
For example, the River Danube.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.660 align:middle line:84%
The river, the Danube,
which then becomes--

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:55.570 align:middle line:90%
it goes westwards.

01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:57.090 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the
people of the Anu,

01:03:57.090 --> 01:03:58.900 align:middle line:90%
which becomes Tuatha de Danaan.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:03:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And from there,
from Central Europe

01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:04.112 align:middle line:84%
they go southwards towards the--
they were looking for an island

01:04:04.112 --> 01:04:05.820 align:middle line:84%
again, I'm sure,
because again, they want

01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:07.600 align:middle line:90%
to recreate their former world.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And back then,
Sardinia and Corsica

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:11.550 align:middle line:90%
were actually connected.

01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And that would have made
a very, very large piece

01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:14.670 align:middle line:90%
of real estate.

01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
essence of the people coming

01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:20.190 align:middle line:84%
from the north, from Europe,
ended up in Sardinia.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So that seems to
match what the--

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.017 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
very interesting.

01:04:23.017 --> 01:04:24.767 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
confirm that with Angela

01:04:24.767 --> 01:04:26.850 align:middle line:84%
because she's not aware
of what we're finding yet.

01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, good.

01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're
going to go both ways

01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:30.103 align:middle line:84%
and have another
conversation with her about

01:04:30.103 --> 01:04:32.550 align:middle line:84%
that because she was very clear
in, what was the strongest

01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:33.090 align:middle line:90%
thing she got?

01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:35.970 align:middle line:84%
It was the migratory path of the
people coming into this region.

01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, we don't know if there
are the same influences

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.490 align:middle line:84%
up north where we were
at the other nuraghe we

01:04:41.490 --> 01:04:42.760 align:middle line:90%
were in a little bit ago.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:47.850 align:middle line:84%
So right at this point, we know
that there are 20,000 to 30,000

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:49.530 align:middle line:84%
of these things
around the island.

01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:53.160 align:middle line:84%
We've learned that the deeper we
go into the foundations of it,

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.840 align:middle line:84%
the more sophisticated
and advanced

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.320 align:middle line:90%
the culture appeared to be.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.210 align:middle line:84%
You would go so far as saying
it does appear that acoustics--

01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:02.460 align:middle line:84%
which are mentioned in the
Bible and other texts--

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
acoustics were
probably known and used

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.890 align:middle line:90%
to move these massive stones.

01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Every culture talks
about the rocks

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:14.280 align:middle line:84%
being moved to the sound
of a voice or a trumpet.

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And again, if you go
to Central America,

01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:20.130 align:middle line:84%
they do talk about the
Waru or the Huari, who

01:05:20.130 --> 01:05:22.380 align:middle line:90%
were the megalithic builders.

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Except that if you
go to Polynesia

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:25.320 align:middle line:84%
and you mention
that word of Huari

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.970 align:middle line:84%
they say, actually,
that's a trumpet.

01:05:26.970 --> 01:05:28.230 align:middle line:90%
The Waru is a trumpet.

01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And in Central America and
South America with the Shining

01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Ones who were the helpers of
Viracocha and his seven people,

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.780 align:middle line:84%
they said that, yes,
we used the trumpets

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:39.000 align:middle line:90%
to move the stones from A to B.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's a wonderful
parallel here in modern life

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:45.778 align:middle line:84%
where about 20 years ago,
Princeton of all people,

01:05:45.778 --> 01:05:47.820 align:middle line:84%
there's a certain laboratory
that actually looked

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:50.220 align:middle line:84%
at the composition of
the stone primarily used

01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:51.195 align:middle line:90%
in these temples.

01:05:51.195 --> 01:05:52.980 align:middle line:84%
It has a specific
type of quartz.

01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And they actually threw sound
frequency at a lump of quartz,

01:05:56.010 --> 01:05:57.750 align:middle line:90%
and the lump gets to levitate.

01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:58.980 align:middle line:90%
So we're now coming--

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:01.260 align:middle line:84%
science is now finally
beginning to catch up

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:04.020 align:middle line:84%
with 12,000 years of
myth and tradition

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:06.410 align:middle line:84%
that, yes, these things were
literally built overnight.

01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, even the
whole area of cymatics,

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:12.770 align:middle line:84%
just watching these beautiful
geometrical movements take

01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:14.420 align:middle line:90%
place in the sand to sound.

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And so there are many ways
in which in the modern world

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.920 align:middle line:84%
we're beginning to prove
that sound can move matter.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And also the fact that
it's the geometry of sound

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
as well, because when sound
hits a physical medium you

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.950 align:middle line:90%
get the sacred geometry.

01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they
again looked at nature.

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.920 align:middle line:84%
This is what I'm talking
about, how these people--

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.870 align:middle line:84%
even here in
Sardinia they'll say,

01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:35.300 align:middle line:84%
they have complete control
of the laws of nature.

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you have
that level of control

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.680 align:middle line:84%
you can see things on
a macroscopic level.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.660 align:middle line:84%
You can see how
sound, when it starts

01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:43.340 align:middle line:90%
to actually go into the--

01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:44.832 align:middle line:90%
let's say this cup, for example.

01:06:44.832 --> 01:06:46.790 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at this
under the microscope,

01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:49.490 align:middle line:84%
under an electron microscope,
you won't see the physical--

01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you can shatter
glass if it's fine glass.

01:06:51.110 --> 01:06:52.318 align:middle line:90%
You shatter glass with sound.

01:06:52.318 --> 01:06:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Even more
importantly, it's a structure.

01:06:54.530 --> 01:06:57.800 align:middle line:84%
The molecules that make up the
cup, it's geometric in nature.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And that brings us back to
why these sites are geometric.

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a relationship
between the outer walls,

01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:06.650 align:middle line:84%
the inner beehive, and
the corkscrew staircase

01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:07.505 align:middle line:90%
that goes around.

01:07:07.505 --> 01:07:09.380 align:middle line:84%
An architect would say,
well, it's practical.

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes, it is.

01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:12.050 align:middle line:84%
You have to get to
the top of the tower.

01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:15.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the relationship
of the walls to the exterior,

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:18.170 align:middle line:84%
to the height creates
its own feeling.

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And also, the fact
that the coils--

01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The coils,
serpentine energy,

01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:22.890 align:middle line:90%
and the way energy moves.

01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's a symbol of
the coiled serpent, which

01:07:26.690 --> 01:07:29.510 align:middle line:90%
actually means the sumer.

01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:31.350 align:middle line:84%
That's where the name
Sumeria comes from,

01:07:31.350 --> 01:07:33.920 align:middle line:84%
which is the origin of
the people of the Anu.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.440 align:middle line:84%
So these things are all
here still in Sardinia.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.780 align:middle line:84%
You have to look at the
etymology and the shape

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:39.890 align:middle line:90%
in which things were made.

01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's been just beyond
a treat of discovery for us

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:45.437 align:middle line:84%
because as I mentioned
before-- it does.

01:07:45.437 --> 01:07:47.270 align:middle line:84%
It really messes with
your head a little bit

01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:48.710 align:middle line:90%
and your perception of life.

01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:51.440 align:middle line:84%
But also again, as I
said, to have it so raw,

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.480 align:middle line:90%
wild, and available to us.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:56.610 align:middle line:84%
That's what's allowed you
to get these measurements,

01:07:56.610 --> 01:07:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very, very
grateful for that.

01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:00.560 align:middle line:84%
But even though we
were not allowed

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:04.130 align:middle line:84%
to shoot some of the sights in
the south, we were so lucky.

01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:07.080 align:middle line:84%
We had a woman named Rosela
with us who Paola knows,

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:09.330 align:middle line:84%
which is how we're-- why
we're all here to begin with.

01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And Rosela is our
local Sardinian guide.

01:08:12.590 --> 01:08:13.610 align:middle line:90%
She's a teacher.

01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:15.950 align:middle line:90%
She knows these sites very well.

01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:19.790 align:middle line:84%
She's also very spiritually
developed, a beautiful soul.

01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:24.529 align:middle line:84%
And Rosela told us
beforehand, no worries.

01:08:24.529 --> 01:08:26.390 align:middle line:84%
We need to go to
this other place.

01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Paola and Rosela and I were
talking about this other place

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:31.340 align:middle line:84%
where the women's
rituals happen,

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.990 align:middle line:84%
but we hadn't exactly
explained it to you guys yet,

01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:35.609 align:middle line:84%
so no one knew what
this was about.

01:08:35.609 --> 01:08:37.915 align:middle line:84%
So now that we've collapsed
our other possibilities

01:08:37.915 --> 01:08:39.290 align:middle line:84%
because we're not
permitted, it's

01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:43.640 align:middle line:84%
like, let's go to the place
Rosela's talking about.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.279 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: We'll develop
our feminine side.

01:08:46.279 --> 01:08:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a treat
that turned out to be.

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I just thought it was
a magnificent day of surprise

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.569 align:middle line:84%
after surprise, and
mishaps as well,

01:08:54.569 --> 01:08:57.149 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to talk
about in our next episode.

01:08:57.149 --> 01:08:59.395 align:middle line:84%
But it's something that
none of us expected.

01:08:59.395 --> 01:09:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad you were on
the journey, because we're

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.240 align:middle line:90%
going to hear about--

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I know.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to hear
from you on that too as a man

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:07.160 align:middle line:90%
experiencing that energy.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.529 align:middle line:84%
So in our next
episode, we're going

01:09:09.529 --> 01:09:13.910 align:middle line:84%
to be headed to these incredibly
ancient pre-Nuragic caves where

01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:17.420 align:middle line:84%
women's sexual rights were
practiced in the ancient past.

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.520 align:middle line:84%
