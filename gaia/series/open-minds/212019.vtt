>>REGINA MEREDITH: One of
the missions of my own career

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.740 align:middle line:10%
is to help people
become more comfortable

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.770 align:middle line:10%
with the innately scary
things in life, such as death.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.380 align:middle line:84%
The more knowledge we
have, the more experience

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.150 align:middle line:84%
with the subject,
the less we fear it.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Today's guest, Dan Drasin,
has done a wonderful job

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.450 align:middle line:84%
of demystifying the natural
process of transitioning

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.960 align:middle line:84%
to a less dense reality when
this incarnation is finished.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And Dan, thank you so
much for joining us here.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.190 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen you
since I met you--

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.240 align:middle line:90%
20 years ago.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Who'd have thought we'd be here
sitting across from each other.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.760 align:middle line:84%
I met you in a
strange circumstance,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.270 align:middle line:84%
but we very loosely stayed
in touch through the years.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.495 align:middle line:84%
And I just love what
you've been doing.

00:00:53.495 --> 00:00:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DANIEL DRASIN:
Well, thank you.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Likewise.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.940 align:middle line:84%
I really admire the
work that you've

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.565 align:middle line:84%
been doing over the
years, and I really

00:00:58.565 --> 00:01:00.570 align:middle line:84%
appreciate the invitation
to be with you today.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
you're most welcome.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.928 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I have
to tell the audience

00:01:03.928 --> 00:01:06.540 align:middle line:84%
you are going to be
dazzled by these film clips

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.750 align:middle line:90%
that you're going to hear.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's start more with
your innate interest

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning,
which is you're

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:84%
very interested in
understanding that life

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:90%
is about consciousness.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.530 align:middle line:90%
It's about frequency.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not about this meatsuit,
as some say, that we're wearing.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And that has put you on an
amazing path as a filmmaker

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and producer of putting together
some films that actually prove

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.830 align:middle line:84%
the existence of the
afterlife-- physically

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.720 align:middle line:84%
proved the existence
of the afterlife,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.510 align:middle line:90%
and everyone loves these films.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:10%
But I want to start more with
your own ideas on consciousness

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.830 align:middle line:10%
and why you decided to
write this particular book.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.920 align:middle line:10%
>>DRASIN: Well, I'm not
quite sure how far back it

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:10%
goes, but probably to my
early childhood, when I became

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.300 align:middle line:10%
aware of having precognitive
dreams, dreams that would,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:10%
in some sense, come
true shortly afterwards,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.390 align:middle line:10%
I didn't understand this, but
it gave me an important clue

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:10%
that in the theater of life,
stuff goes on backstage.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.610 align:middle line:84%
There are aspects to reality
that are not necessarily

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.490 align:middle line:84%
reflected in the materialistic--
in the physical world

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.010 align:middle line:84%
that we believe we
inhabit exclusively.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:10%
So this took the form
of an abiding interest

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.260 align:middle line:10%
in various things
that our culture

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.700 align:middle line:10%
considered to be
outside the norm,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.750 align:middle line:10%
became very involved in UFO
research over the years,

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.810 align:middle line:10%
starting, actually, way
back in the early days

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.055 align:middle line:10%
when it was not a
controversial topic.

00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Would you
explain that again?

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.722 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: Well, back in--

00:02:39.722 --> 00:02:42.343 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What days-- what
era are you talking about?

00:02:42.343 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: I'm talking
about the 1940s and '50S

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.652 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: I'm an old guy.

00:02:46.652 --> 00:02:48.020 align:middle line:90%
I was born in '42.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.980 align:middle line:84%
So I don't quite remember
Roswell, but, at that time,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.240 align:middle line:84%
I do remember listening to a
radio broadcast every evening,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.360 align:middle line:84%
a mainstream New
York news commentator

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.090 align:middle line:84%
named Frank Edwards,
and he would give UFO

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:84%
sighting and landing
reports, which

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.270 align:middle line:84%
were a perfectly acceptable
realm of discussion

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.070 align:middle line:90%
at that time--

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: --before the curtain
came down in the 1950s.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And it became an
object of ridicule.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: So I was very
intrigued with that.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And that was, for me,
another example of what

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.255 align:middle line:90%
goes on backstage.

00:03:26.255 --> 00:03:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Actually, as you're
talking about that,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I remember as a news
anchor in the early 1980s,

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:84%
we would have this stuff
come across the wire,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:84%
across writers and such AP,
where there had been a sighting

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and the police were called,
and the whole town was

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.010 align:middle line:90%
aware of what had gone on.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.168 align:middle line:90%
And I was always warned, no.

00:03:44.168 --> 00:03:45.460 align:middle line:90%
I tried to write stories on it.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:84%
They always told me we don't
do that, toss them out.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260 align:middle line:90%
And so, they never made it on.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And that was part
of that repression

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.630 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not as though
it's not happening,

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.307 align:middle line:84%
and it's not as though the
news stations don't know.

00:03:56.307 --> 00:03:58.870 align:middle line:84%
They won't allow you
to know, us to know.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.770 align:middle line:90%
So, continue on.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: Yeah,
and of course, we

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.038 align:middle line:84%
know that's going
on today as well.

00:04:02.038 --> 00:04:05.980 align:middle line:84%
There's this whole battle
between the disclosure elements

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.690 align:middle line:84%
in the armed forces now as well
and the old guard as it were.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And those of us who are
really interested in bringing

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.120 align:middle line:84%
the hidden, together
with the obvious,

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.579 align:middle line:84%
are following this
very, very closely.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think the question
of a so-called afterlife

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.670 align:middle line:84%
is part of this bigger
picture of disclosure.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:84%
In your book, "The New
Science of the Afterlife,"

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.300 align:middle line:84%
which I loved because you
get right to the point.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.730 align:middle line:84%
But I love the fact
you're so in the face

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.440 align:middle line:84%
with some of the
statements you made.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I'm going to
bring a couple of them up.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:84%
I was writing my
little notes-- love it.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Because you just don't
put up with fools anymore.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.880 align:middle line:90%
You reach that point in life.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And basically, you're
saying the big block

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.760 align:middle line:84%
to our understanding
of the nature of life

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.510 align:middle line:84%
and reality has been
scientific materialism.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.890 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, you're
using a materialistic approach

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.480 align:middle line:90%
because that's where we live.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.530 align:middle line:90%
We live in that world.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.640 align:middle line:84%
You're using that to help
us understand the invisible.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: Well,
yes, I think it's

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.590 align:middle line:84%
important to bring in as
much physical evidence

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.295 align:middle line:84%
of the metaphysical as
we can get our hands on.

00:05:17.295 --> 00:05:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.878 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: Instrumental
transcommunication

00:05:19.878 --> 00:05:20.990 align:middle line:90%
is one aspect of that.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.698 align:middle line:84%
That is communication
from the other side

00:05:22.698 --> 00:05:23.930 align:middle line:90%
through modern electronics.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.450 align:middle line:84%
But anything that
brings the unfamiliar

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.675 align:middle line:84%
into the realm of the
familiar is a bridge builder--

00:05:29.675 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: --for
people's awareness.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and those
are the two documentaries

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.462 align:middle line:84%
that are going to be
focusing on in a little bit,

00:05:35.462 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:84%
calling Earth, which is
that technology, and then

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.745 align:middle line:90%
the famous "Scole.

00:05:39.745 --> 00:05:41.120 align:middle line:84%
The Afterlife
Experiment" is what

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:84%
you call the video,
but the famous Scole

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.413 align:middle line:84%
experiments out of England,
which were just phenomenal.

00:05:46.413 --> 00:05:47.580 align:middle line:90%
You did a great job on that.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:90%
So let's look back--

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: I want to give
credit to my co-producer,

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Tim Coleman, who worked with me
on these documentaries, which

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.180 align:middle line:84%
we started back in the early
2000s, took us over 10 years

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.530 align:middle line:90%
to produce these.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.987 align:middle line:90%
And anyway, I hope--

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they're
very carefully done.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.658 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have great
examples of this phenomena

00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:10.200 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to be showing
the audience in a little bit.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what you're
talking about in the book

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
is to begin using
our own discernment.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Because, as you say, materialism
became its own religion

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.160 align:middle line:90%
that could not be questioned.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
watching this, when they're

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:84%
trying to talk to their
friends and their family,

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.730 align:middle line:84%
will be given a bit
of the cold shoulder,

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:84%
made fun of, because
they dare paint outside

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.840 align:middle line:90%
of the materialism color box.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: Or worse.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or worse.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: People
have been committed

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.660 align:middle line:84%
to psychiatric institutions,
ostracized by their families,

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.460 align:middle line:90%
so on.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Historically,
they have been put away.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: And it's
still going on.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:57.660 align:middle line:84%
I've met people to whom this
has occurred in recent decades.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.490 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if we're still
at the tail end of the Middle

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Ages, fighting the advent
of a coming enlightenment

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:90%
as it were.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is beginning to
change now, of course.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is
beginning to change.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And as you call it, it's
been the worship of--

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and explain this because
I love it-- the worship

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.852 align:middle line:90%
of the building blocks, right?

00:07:18.852 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: The worship
of building blocks.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.680 align:middle line:84%
If you look into
materialistic science,

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.210 align:middle line:90%
which is only one science.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Because science is just
a method of inquiry.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not wedded to a
materialistic approach

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.430 align:middle line:90%
necessarily.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.690 align:middle line:90%
But it often is.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And we find the leading
edge of physics going on,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.170 align:middle line:84%
at least, 100 years,
has been looking

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.660 align:middle line:84%
at smaller and smaller
particles, and the particles

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.880 align:middle line:84%
that make up the
smaller particles,

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and the ones that make
up those particles.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, they'll find
the real god particle one day,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:90%
and then what?

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then what?

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.838 align:middle line:90%
Which is pure consciousness.

00:07:57.838 --> 00:07:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: But they
don't go that far.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, they
will never go that far.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: And even quantum
physics, which is now

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.880 align:middle line:84%
about 100 years
old, a century old,

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.073 align:middle line:84%
they had to label it quantum
mechanics to get it acceptable.

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.790 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:90%
They had to do that.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: And that's what really
began to push the envelope away

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:21.250 align:middle line:84%
from a solid building block
reference in connection

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:90%
with what we call reality.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that
when you ask a skeptic

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.905 align:middle line:84%
what reality is or what
I call a pseudo skeptic--

00:08:27.905 --> 00:08:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I was
going to get into that.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.520 align:middle line:90%
We'll get into that.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: They'll always
pound their fist on the table

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.659 align:middle line:90%
and say, this is reality, right?

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:35.679 align:middle line:90%
The physical.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.929 align:middle line:84%
But even the physical
plane is not just solid.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.159 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are what
percent water, right?

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.350 align:middle line:84%
There's liquids, there's
gases, there's plasmas.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.610 align:middle line:84%
So what we take to be
physical is not physical,

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.920 align:middle line:84%
quote, unquote, "physical
or the physical plane."

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
purely non-physical.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it on an atomic
level, there's nothing here.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: Right.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:56.560 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're a perception.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: Exactly.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And this gets into the question,
when we speak of the afterlife,

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.830 align:middle line:90%
we use the term the veil, right?

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.780 align:middle line:90%
What's the veil?

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:12.470 align:middle line:84%
In my book, I try to make a case
for the veil being our senses.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Our senses are tuned to a very,
very narrow band of reality.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:90%
We take that to be all there is.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Now we know that you and I
are sitting here right now

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:25.960 align:middle line:84%
have tens of thousands of
radio and television broadcasts

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.600 align:middle line:84%
and wireless communications
going through this space

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and through our
bodies as we speak,

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.970 align:middle line:84%
but they don't exist,
unless we have a device that

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.980 align:middle line:90%
resonates with it.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.970 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a model
for our physical senses

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.283 align:middle line:84%
versus what we call
the greater reality.

00:09:42.283 --> 00:09:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And you wrote here--
and I wrote down

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.100 align:middle line:84%
a couple of the things you
said is that materialism

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.500 align:middle line:90%
is an assumption about reality.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.470 align:middle line:84%
It's just an
assumption, and it's

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.630 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be
about open inquiry

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.310 align:middle line:84%
without knowing the
answers or outcomes.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what science seems
to be most afraid of-- is not

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.120 align:middle line:90%
having the answer.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: Well, I wouldn't
say it's science so much,

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.550 align:middle line:84%
but the scientific and
academic establishment.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's a fair
way to say it, of course.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: Which, in some
ways-- and I'm sorry for it

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:20.440 align:middle line:84%
because institutions often
have to maintain, at least,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.100 align:middle line:84%
a somewhat conservative
standpoint.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.695 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.695 --> 00:10:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But to
completely stomp

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:90%
out potentials is not cool.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: Right.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.542 align:middle line:90%
That's crossing a line.

00:10:30.542 --> 00:10:32.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've probably
familiar with the story

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.460 align:middle line:84%
of John Mack, who was a
professor of psychiatry

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard, almost lost his
tenure there because he was

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:90%
investigating UFO abductions.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, they
couldn't kick him out

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.130 align:middle line:84%
because he followed
proper scientific protocol

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:51.930 align:middle line:90%
all the way.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:53.472 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's
a good example.

00:10:53.472 --> 00:10:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: And this
is where science

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:84%
and institutional
inertia butt heads.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.785 align:middle line:84%
And in our society,
it's inevitable,

00:11:01.785 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:84%
there's going to
be some of that.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.718 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's time
to shift gears now.

00:11:05.718 --> 00:11:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think it is, too,
and the work you're doing

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.097 align:middle line:90%
is really moving us toward that.

00:11:10.097 --> 00:11:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: I hope so.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:11.730 align:middle line:90%
I hope so.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I think that
particularly in our time,

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.930 align:middle line:84%
with so many stresses and
so much loss of life as well

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:23.680 align:middle line:84%
in the world, that we do need to
shift our perspective on death

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:90%
.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.882 align:middle line:84%
I use the term
afterlife very loosely.

00:11:26.882 --> 00:11:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's
somewhat misleading.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the longest
chapter in my book

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.670 align:middle line:84%
is about language
and how language

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:90%
influences our take on reality.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And I try to have some
fun with that as well.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Afterlife presupposes
that consciousness

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.780 align:middle line:84%
is created in the body and then
somehow continues afterwards.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
it works that way.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.260 align:middle line:90%
I think we've been here.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:52.690 align:middle line:84%
The self, the inner being
has been here forever.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And we take on these bodies
and these human lives

00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:01.270 align:middle line:84%
for whatever purposes that we,
as individuals and as groups,

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.680 align:middle line:90%
may choose.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we pass on
to the next phase.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And until we start understanding
that as a flow pattern

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.800 align:middle line:84%
rather than a series of
hard-edged comings and goings

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.700 align:middle line:84%
as it were, I think
we're going to be stuck

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.590 align:middle line:90%
in some very old patterns.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a dark age, in my opinion,
that we've been stuck in.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.435 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
talking about death,

00:12:26.435 --> 00:12:27.560 align:middle line:90%
there's been so much death.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.768 align:middle line:90%
And there's going to be more.

00:12:28.768 --> 00:12:31.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think the
thing we went through

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.160 align:middle line:84%
over the last few
years is not done.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160 align:middle line:84%
I think this is going to happen
a couple more times anyway.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So one thing that a channeler
that we talked to here,

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:84%
named Lee Harris, his group
are called the Z's, and they're

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.260 align:middle line:90%
very pragmatic.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.843 align:middle line:84%
And I was chatting
with them recently.

00:12:45.843 --> 00:12:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And they said, the
problem is humans

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.790 align:middle line:84%
are so sentimental
about death, when

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.690 align:middle line:84%
it's just another
transition you've

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.700 align:middle line:84%
all been through so
many times and will

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.930 align:middle line:90%
be going through so many more.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And so to get us over that
fear of the ego identity

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.200 align:middle line:84%
not existing any longer,
that's the real catch

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.540 align:middle line:84%
is the fear that we
don't matter and that we

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.450 align:middle line:84%
won't be remembered as though we
were never here to begin with.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: Well,
that's a good point.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think that's
mostly what people fear,

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:16.790 align:middle line:90%
not understanding.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.350 align:middle line:90%
This story goes on and on.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:84%
You've already been through
so many of these iterations.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:21.530 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk--

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: And one
other point about time.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.520 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I discovered
almost by accident, not too

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:84%
long ago, was the
nature of eternity.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.437 align:middle line:84%
Eternity is not merely an
infinite extension of time.

00:13:38.437 --> 00:13:39.520 align:middle line:90%
This is a very tricky one.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is
so-- explain it.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: I'm not sure it can be
explained but only experienced,

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.540 align:middle line:90%
but I can talk about it.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.450 align:middle line:84%
This experience occurred
to me quite unexpectedly

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.530 align:middle line:84%
while I was watching a YouTube
video of a channeled session

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:57.520 align:middle line:84%
with a young boy who had taken
his life, a Skype session

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.520 align:middle line:84%
between him through a
medium and his mother.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And without going
into a lot of detail,

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.550 align:middle line:84%
just watching this
interaction, I

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:10.360 align:middle line:84%
was suddenly brought into
the space of what I think

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.460 align:middle line:90%
I can only define as eternity.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.290 align:middle line:90%
It lasted in objective time.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.910 align:middle line:84%
It lasted about
less than a minute.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:23.700 align:middle line:84%
But during that time, I
realized, oh, my god, eternity

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.860 align:middle line:84%
is not just an infinite
extension of what we call time.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.050 align:middle line:90%
It is totally open ended.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And our human minds
have trouble wrapping

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.650 align:middle line:84%
it-- wrapping themselves
around anything that doesn't

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:90%
have beginnings and endings.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.227 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's true.

00:14:40.227 --> 00:14:42.207 align:middle line:84%
We live in a very linear
dimension of time.

00:14:42.207 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: And it's
divided up incrementally.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: One of the interesting
things about the new James Webb

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Space Telescope is
that it has brought out

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:56.040 align:middle line:84%
of the woodwork, the
cosmologists who are loosely

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.780 align:middle line:90%
labeled the eternalists.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.997 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: Which I
was really quite

00:14:59.997 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:90%
unaware of until recently.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:02.318 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fascinating.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: Our cosmologists who
have proposed that there never

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.840 align:middle line:84%
was a beginning and
never will be an ending.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.675 align:middle line:90%
And that's really hard for our--

00:15:10.675 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's hard for us
to get our minds around.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: The point
is that we are,

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I think in the process
of understanding

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.690 align:middle line:90%
what we call time in a new way.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And that, obviously,
encompasses questions

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:22.550 align:middle line:90%
of birth, life, and death.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
something-- that's a game

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:84%
we're all playing in
one way or another.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
capturing part of it

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.430 align:middle line:84%
in your films, which we'll
show in just a little bit here.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.128 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned
pseudo skeptics before,

00:15:32.128 --> 00:15:33.170 align:middle line:90%
and this is a good point.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I'll tell you
what I couldn't stand,

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.320 align:middle line:84%
working in the news
and mainstream media is

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.360 align:middle line:84%
if you wanted to
bring any of this up,

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.560 align:middle line:84%
you had to trot on the one
and only famous skeptic.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.900 align:middle line:84%
He had a bad skeptic
across his forehead,

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.550 align:middle line:84%
didn't matter what
the subject was.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.450 align:middle line:84%
He was going to basically
try to nullify anything

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:90%
that you had to say.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So you call them
pseudo skeptics.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what real
healthy skepticism is versus

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.770 align:middle line:84%
what some people that are
going to show people your film

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:05.233 align:middle line:90%
will have to say.

00:16:05.233 --> 00:16:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: Well,
healthy skepticism

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.870 align:middle line:84%
is simply a matter of
looking into things.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.670 align:middle line:90%
We observe a new phenomenon.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Skepticism is part of the
scientific methodology.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.560 align:middle line:84%
You see something
happening, you look into it.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily accept
a particular conclusion

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:90%
immediately.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what the
scientific method or process

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.150 align:middle line:90%
is about.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:90%
You propose hypotheses.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.580 align:middle line:90%
You test them in an orderly way.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.493 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to be
fooling yourselves.

00:16:27.493 --> 00:16:28.910 align:middle line:84%
One way or another,
you don't want

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:31.550 align:middle line:84%
to fall into belief or
disbelief which is just

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:90%
another flavor of belief.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.780 align:middle line:84%
You want to go right down
the middle and stay with

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.470 align:middle line:84%
the process what
so-called skeptics--

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.800 align:middle line:90%
I call the cult of skepticism--

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.660 align:middle line:84%
its position is that there are
areas which we cannot and must

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:48.590 align:middle line:90%
not look into.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.643 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, gatekeepers.

00:16:50.643 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: Gatekeepers.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.320 align:middle line:84%
I think you can look at all
of these various influences

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and movements, so
on as a religions.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Each belief system within
its own cohort is inviolable.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Some people get stuck
in it for a lifetime,

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.700 align:middle line:84%
whether it's mainstream religion
or beliefs about anything else.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.579 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's imperative
now that people at least begin

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:15.930 align:middle line:84%
to broaden their horizons
a bit and be willing to--

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.420 align:middle line:84%
and the hardest part of it
is being willing to admit,

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.069 align:middle line:90%
oh, I was wrong.

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:84%
And not maybe necessarily
wrong, but maybe

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:24.381 align:middle line:90%
my views were incomplete.

00:17:24.381 --> 00:17:25.339 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:26.339 align:middle line:90%
I simply didn't know.

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:27.139 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:17:27.139 --> 00:17:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: Because some of what's
in the narrow box may be true.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:34.230 align:middle line:84%
It's just a question of widening
one's perspective and which

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:84%
brings up for me the
question of language,

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:41.640 align:middle line:90%
words, such as supernatural.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.120 align:middle line:84%
What's supernatural depends
on our definition of nature.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.720 align:middle line:84%
So who are we to say that nature
begins here and ends here,

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.600 align:middle line:84%
and everything beyond that
is supernatural, right?

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And as far as
paranormal is concerned,

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.140 align:middle line:84%
how do we know what's normal
if we can't discuss it openly?

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: So it's an
arbitrary definition.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:01.713 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now you
have a definition

00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:04.980 align:middle line:84%
for people who tend to view
science in that way, which

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.330 align:middle line:90%
is pseudo skeptics.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.080 align:middle line:84%
They're not a
classic true skeptic

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.880 align:middle line:90%
that's going through a process.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.950 align:middle line:84%
They're just there
to deny and censor.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm with you, 100%
And I've interviewed them,

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.850 align:middle line:90%
and I'm done with that story.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
love Gaia so much.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to bring them on
just because you say one thing.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: You've been in
the trenches with that.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:25.170 align:middle line:90%
I respect that.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have
for a long time.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.870 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
along the way--

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to get
toward the films now--

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.950 align:middle line:90%
is you came across the notion--

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:35.950 align:middle line:84%
well, first of all, you
have your own experience

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:39.050 align:middle line:84%
with communicating with a very
dear one on the other side.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
that toward the end,

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:45.130 align:middle line:84%
but you came across the
technology that's been

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:47.020 align:middle line:90%
used to capture these voices.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And how did that come about
to give you the notion,

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:84%
yes, we can make this
demonstrable to people now.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: Well, I had no
idea about any of this

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:03.070 align:middle line:84%
until the mid-1990s, when I was
actually living here in Boulder

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:08.150 align:middle line:84%
and met a man named Mark Macy,
who lives in the area here.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And he had been involved in this
instrumental transcommunication

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.840 align:middle line:84%
field for some years,
worked with groups here

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and in Europe and South America,
who had been routinely doing

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.320 align:middle line:84%
this communication
with the other side

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.800 align:middle line:84%
through various kinds
of electronic devices.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.990 align:middle line:84%
At first, I was a
bit skeptical of it.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And say, well, has
the CIA been getting

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.620 align:middle line:84%
into people's tape recorders
and things like that,

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:37.240 align:middle line:84%
but very quickly got past
that phase of, perhaps,

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.660 align:middle line:84%
excessive skepticism
there and began

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.970 align:middle line:84%
to meet and communicate
with more people who

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:46.450 align:middle line:84%
had been doing this
practice and finding

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:48.448 align:middle line:90%
it absolutely fascinating.

00:19:48.448 --> 00:19:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You want to take it
back where kind of to the '50s?

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Because it really all began with
our ability to record things.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: Right.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:58.160 align:middle line:84%
In the post-war time
of the late 1940s,

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.840 align:middle line:84%
early 1950s, where
wartime industries

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:84%
were being repurposed
for consumer production.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of the products
that came on the scene

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.070 align:middle line:90%
was the audio tape recorder.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.590 align:middle line:84%
So Sunday preachers
and amateur musicians

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.530 align:middle line:84%
could record their
priceless words and music

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and play them back and
preserve them for all eternity.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And some folks began to
hear on their tapes, voices

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.860 align:middle line:90%
that didn't belong there.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.440 align:middle line:84%
At first, they were faint, and
they were dismissed as well.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the machine's picking up
a radio station or something.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And that thing did
happen occasionally.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.330 align:middle line:84%
So at least, in
the United States,

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.640 align:middle line:84%
this phenomenon was
pretty much dismissed.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.600 align:middle line:10%
In Europe, it was
taken more seriously.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:10%
It began, as far as
we know, with a man

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.560 align:middle line:10%
named Friedrich
Jurgenson, who was

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:10%
a well known Swedish
documentary filmmaker

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:10%
and artist and so on--

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.380 align:middle line:10%
well known in his time.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.410 align:middle line:84%
He went out one night to
record nocturnal bird sounds

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.360 align:middle line:84%
for a documentary
he was producing.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And when he played
back the tape,

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.490 align:middle line:84%
in the spaces
between the sounds,

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:84%
he heard faint voices discussing
nocturnal bird sounds.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.030 align:middle line:84%
He thought, well, this
is quite a coincidence

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:84%
that it's picking up a
radio station discussing

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.320 align:middle line:90%
nocturnal bird sounds.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And he thought, no more
of it until he then

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.680 align:middle line:84%
heard his deceased mother's
voice on one of his tapes,

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.740 align:middle line:84%
calling him by his
childhood nickname, Friedl.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, he
threw up his hands

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.550 align:middle line:90%
and said, OK, we have--

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.590 align:middle line:84%
something's going
on here, and we have

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.870 align:middle line:90%
to study this scientifically.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So for a number of
years, he experimented,

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:36.540 align:middle line:84%
simply rolling the tape, asking
questions, leaving a pause,

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:84%
asking more
questions, and so on.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And when he played
back the tapes,

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.750 align:middle line:84%
there were responses
in these pauses.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:45.930 align:middle line:84%
He was then joined by a
Latvian researcher named

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Konstantin Raudive, who worked
with Jurgenson for a time

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.520 align:middle line:84%
and then went off and
did his own experiments.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And by the time he
passed on in 1974,

00:21:55.030 --> 00:22:00.760 align:middle line:84%
he had recorded, by all
accounts, between 60 and 70,000

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.470 align:middle line:90%
of these voices.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:05.320 align:middle line:84%
He put out a phonograph
record at the time

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.370 align:middle line:84%
that included quite a
number of his dialogues

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.278 align:middle line:90%
with these voices.

00:22:10.278 --> 00:22:11.320 align:middle line:90%
It was quite fascinating.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.250 align:middle line:84%
You'll hear some
of this in a film.

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
hear it in just a minute now.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: And then
when he passed on,

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.570 align:middle line:84%
he started showing up in
his surviving colleagues'

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:20.480 align:middle line:90%
communications.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: And some of this is
documented in my film as well.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's this long
standing tradition.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I spent some time
with a young man named

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Robert Vandenbroek in the
Netherlands back in 2014,

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:37.940 align:middle line:90%
I think it was.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And he is able to produce photos
of the deceased on a cam--

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.930 align:middle line:90%
You hand him your camera.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.750 align:middle line:84%
He'll point it at the wall
and knock off a few shots,

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.910 align:middle line:84%
and it's highly likely
that photographs

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.790 align:middle line:84%
of deceased individuals
and other things

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:57.720 align:middle line:84%
will appear in those photos
that shouldn't be there.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And when I visited him
for about a week, set up

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:05.320 align:middle line:84%
very rigid protocols to make
sure there was no hanky panky,

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and in the photographic
experiments

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:12.130 align:middle line:84%
we did, four anomalous shots
showed up, two of which

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:14.107 align:middle line:84%
depicted Friedrich
Jurgenson in this.

00:23:14.107 --> 00:23:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love it.

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:18.580 align:middle line:84%
So they're all
collaborating together.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: So it appears.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.578 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why don't
we-- one of the films

00:23:21.578 --> 00:23:23.380 align:middle line:84%
you did is called
calling Earth, and that's

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.838 align:middle line:84%
the one that's
dealing particularly

00:23:24.838 --> 00:23:25.970 align:middle line:90%
with this phenomena.

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And so let's take a look
at that clip right now.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: OK.

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the fact that
we survive bodily death is

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.460 align:middle line:90%
a scientific fact.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.875 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing to
do with religion.

00:23:35.875 --> 00:23:40.410 align:middle line:90%


00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>> One day, in the
summer of 2002,

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Martha Copeland
of Lawrenceville,

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Georgia played back a sound
recording she'd made earlier

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:84%
that day and heard the voice
of her daughter, Kathy,

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.615 align:middle line:90%
disciplining her dog.

00:23:51.615 --> 00:23:54.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Dija, go outside.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>> That wouldn't
have been so unusual,

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:59.910 align:middle line:84%
except that six months earlier,
Kathy had died in an auto

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:00.720 align:middle line:90%
accident.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.780 align:middle line:10%
>> One evening, to
my great surprise,

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.030 align:middle line:10%
with a equipment I was
developing at the time,

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:06.945 align:middle line:10%
I heard a voice.

00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:09.540 align:middle line:90%


00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I was really startled.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:14.100 align:middle line:10%
>> After the second
or third test,

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:18.310 align:middle line:10%
I immediately got voices
saying, we are the dead.

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.410 align:middle line:90%
We are alive.

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:22.470 align:middle line:84%
We are able to
think and to speak.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.890 align:middle line:10%
>> A brief definition of the
electronic voice phenomenon,

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:30.960 align:middle line:10%
or EVP as we call it, would
be the existence of voices

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.860 align:middle line:10%
of unknown origin, which
appear in tape recordings,

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:10%
particularly, but could also
be recorded in other ways.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:39.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Go to the river of light.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Time just passes here.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Once-earthly Jerry.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:46.210 align:middle line:10%
>> I can speak.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:47.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Ahh.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:48.470 align:middle line:10%
Yes, dear Monique.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:49.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Cathy's here.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.690 align:middle line:10%
I'm really saying this.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a voice
of my late father,

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and he addressed me with my
nickname he used when I was

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.075 align:middle line:90%
a little boy.

00:25:00.075 --> 00:25:02.250 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Here was this voice that
I recognized immediately

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:90%
as my mother.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:07.560 align:middle line:10%
>> I miss you.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.000 align:middle line:10%
Rob, just missing you, pal.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.500 align:middle line:10%
>> I miss you very much.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Bra-den.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.767 align:middle line:10%
I know Braden.

00:25:14.767 --> 00:25:16.715 align:middle line:10%
>> Our Braden is beautiful.

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:18.663 align:middle line:10%
>> Braden's not dead.

00:25:18.663 --> 00:25:19.637 align:middle line:10%
>> He's alive.

00:25:19.637 --> 00:25:22.072 align:middle line:10%
>> Let Braden talk to his mom.

00:25:22.072 --> 00:25:24.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Pick up the phone, mom.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:24.994 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, mom.

00:25:24.994 --> 00:25:27.940 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That last bit
there always gets me.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, anyone
who's lost a child.

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And this has to be
a mixed blessing

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:40.120 align:middle line:84%
to be so close, to hear
their voice, yet, so far.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And so, let's talk about this
woman and her son, Braden,

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.280 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And she continues to communicate
with him from what you say,

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.020 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: Right.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Yes, Vicki Talbot is still
in touch with her son.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.410 align:middle line:84%
She works with a group
of mothers who've

00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:02.560 align:middle line:84%
lost their children, and they
post some of their recordings

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.460 align:middle line:90%
online.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is a group
of mothers who

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:09.010 align:middle line:84%
have been in touch with their
deceased kids and others

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:13.240 align:middle line:84%
through this technique of
using electronic devices.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.148 align:middle line:84%
Vicki started with-- I think
this is the first she'd heard

00:26:16.148 --> 00:26:18.190 align:middle line:84%
from her son, Braden, was
through their answering

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:18.990 align:middle line:90%
machine--

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:21.700 align:middle line:84%
old-fashioned, tape
cassette answering machine.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.880 align:middle line:84%
That's when he said,
pick up the phone, mom.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: And she had not been
in the habit of picking up

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.570 align:middle line:84%
the phone, but of just letting
the answering machine take

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:30.370 align:middle line:90%
the calls.

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.828 align:middle line:84%
And she said afterwards, I
could have kicked myself for not

00:26:32.828 --> 00:26:34.270 align:middle line:90%
actually picking up the phone.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:40.090 align:middle line:84%
But since then, at the time,
they used tape cassettes.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Now she uses her iPad
and her iPhone as

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:47.420 align:middle line:84%
do a number of her friends
who are doing this practice.

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:51.430 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
enhances it or inhibits it.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.350 align:middle line:84%
We know that an
emotional connection

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:58.460 align:middle line:84%
with one on the other
side is a big help.

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.360 align:middle line:84%
We don't know whether the
time of the year or the phase

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.690 align:middle line:84%
of the moon or things
we know nothing about

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:09.760 align:middle line:84%
affect this process, but it
works enough of the time,

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.470 align:middle line:84%
that people who practice it have
had continuity of experience

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:16.670 align:middle line:90%
going over periods of years.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I have
a question here.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.160 align:middle line:84%
When we think about
this, oftentimes,

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:25.300 align:middle line:84%
when we think about automatic
writing or beings or entities

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.340 align:middle line:84%
coming through and
speaking with us,

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.840 align:middle line:84%
when it's someone who's
a person who's deceased,

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.560 align:middle line:84%
we often think, oh, they haven't
made their full transition

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.950 align:middle line:90%
to the other side.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:39.410 align:middle line:84%
So my question would be, from
what you've been able to glean,

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.780 align:middle line:84%
the entities that do
come through like Braden

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.540 align:middle line:84%
and talking to his mother, that
might be an arrangement where

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.820 align:middle line:84%
he's just staying close
through his mother's life

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.770 align:middle line:90%
to keep her comfortable.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:51.440 align:middle line:84%
But could it also be
that the entity actually

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.620 align:middle line:84%
does make passage through to
other domains and dimensions

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.360 align:middle line:84%
but can extend
part of themselves

00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.710 align:middle line:84%
as desired or needed
through to communicate?

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: I don't
think our language

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and our concepts really
encompass what's going on here.

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: I think what you're
saying is probably true.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:13.340 align:middle line:84%
My understanding
from various sources

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.030 align:middle line:84%
is that everyone's
experience of transition

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.170 align:middle line:84%
is different, just as
our experience in life

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:19.970 align:middle line:90%
is different.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:24.710 align:middle line:84%
It's highly individual, depends
on our command of the energies

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:27.830 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves, energies of
the environment that we're

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:30.980 align:middle line:84%
in, and so on, and the
energies of the barriers

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:35.330 align:middle line:84%
that exist between
the different levels.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:37.130 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the
language of physics

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:41.240 align:middle line:84%
that describes enough of that,
but we do know enough, just

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.780 align:middle line:84%
on the level of empirical
science, of observation,

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.780 align:middle line:90%
that these are--

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.308 align:middle line:84%
number one, the
phenomenon exists.

00:28:49.308 --> 00:28:50.600 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about that.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.475 align:middle line:84%
That's the most important
thing to establish.

00:28:52.475 --> 00:28:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Stuff's going on, right?

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: And understanding
the mechanism of it,

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:02.270 align:middle line:84%
I think-- and the mechanisms
of it will come in due course.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I think the
most important thing

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:08.120 align:middle line:84%
is for those who practice
it to practice it,

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:12.620 align:middle line:84%
to cultivate the personal
habits and maybe even

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.500 align:middle line:84%
condition the
energetic environment

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:20.360 align:middle line:84%
by doing it so that
the environment slowly

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:25.430 align:middle line:84%
shifts its capacity to be more
transparent between levels.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:26.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm struggling for language.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I understand
because it's hard.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.383 align:middle line:84%
You can't really explain because
you're not on the other side.

00:29:30.383 --> 00:29:35.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to maybe
give a little bit of advice

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.640 align:middle line:84%
to someone who's lost
someone, that they would love

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.280 align:middle line:84%
to be able to finish up
something with or hear from,

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.370 align:middle line:84%
simply have the comfort of
knowing they still exist, how

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:45.620 align:middle line:90%
would you lay that foundation?

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I know you're just starting
to touch into that.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.620 align:middle line:84%
How would you lay a foundation
for that kind of communication?

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Would you just put your
intention and love out and say,

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.340 align:middle line:84%
can we communicate through
maybe my iPad or my cell

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:02.755 align:middle line:84%
phone or my computer,
or is that more random?

00:30:02.755 --> 00:30:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: I wish
I could give you

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:05.390 align:middle line:90%
a definitive answer to that.

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We just have to
try and see what happens.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: I think we're
at the stage where

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:13.280 align:middle line:84%
we have to throw everything
at the metaphysical wall

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.270 align:middle line:90%
and see what sticks.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: And in
doing so, I imagine

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:20.300 align:middle line:84%
that new avenues
of communication

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.460 align:middle line:84%
will also open up, in
addition to those that we're

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.950 align:middle line:84%
familiar with and those
that have been practiced

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:29.930 align:middle line:84%
by people who maybe we
have no awareness of

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:31.108 align:middle line:90%
may come to the fore.

00:30:31.108 --> 00:30:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And just some of the
basic old-fashioned connecting

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:35.960 align:middle line:84%
with your own higher self
and their higher self.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: I had a visit from my
deceased father some years ago

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:44.210 align:middle line:84%
that was preceded by events
in my actual life over

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:49.190 align:middle line:84%
the preceding week, that I
didn't understand until I went

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:53.960 align:middle line:84%
to sleep one night, and
there was my dad, looking--

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.990 align:middle line:84%
he died in his 90s,
and he was looking

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:58.910 align:middle line:90%
like he was in his middle 30s.

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And my first thought--
and he was really

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:04.230 align:middle line:84%
hair slicked back and
had this ruddy suntan.

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And my first thought was, oh,
he's overdone his astral body.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it's just the way
you relate to feeling strong.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: Yeah.

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:11.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: And we had a
wonderful short dialogue.

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:17.677 align:middle line:84%
And part of it was,
love to see you.

00:31:17.677 --> 00:31:18.510 align:middle line:90%
We'll see you again.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:20.010 align:middle line:90%
Eventually, I said, I know dad.

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:22.530 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:26.760 align:middle line:84%
But to me, the evidential
part was what preceded.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.890 align:middle line:84%
The events took place over
a period of five days,

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:31.230 align:middle line:84%
without getting into a lot
of detail, that culminated

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.440 align:middle line:90%
in this visit in a short dream.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.320 align:middle line:90%
And it was unique.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.110 align:middle line:84%
I had not had this
type of experience

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:39.780 align:middle line:84%
before with my late
partner, Jane Kimbro, who

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.670 align:middle line:90%
passed in 2007.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:44.490 align:middle line:84%
I've had communications
of other kinds.

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Sense of her almost physical
presence standing next to me,

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.370 align:middle line:84%
couldn't see her with my
eyes, but she was there.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:53.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to express
this other than to say,

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:54.480 align:middle line:90%
there she was.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.150 align:middle line:84%
She also switched on
a clock radio at night

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.670 align:middle line:84%
and surprised the
Dickens out of me.

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There are
all kinds of hijinks.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Right after my dad
died, six days later,

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I was here doing
this job at Gaia,

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:07.735 align:middle line:84%
and he followed me
into the studio.

00:32:07.735 --> 00:32:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And he was right
where you are sitting,

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.370 align:middle line:84%
but up a little higher
and just thrilled to see

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:12.330 align:middle line:90%
what I do for a living.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:13.413 align:middle line:90%
Because he didn't really--

00:32:13.413 --> 00:32:14.460 align:middle line:90%
he was in his 90s.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.090 align:middle line:10%
He didn't fully understand it.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And so, there are
all these ways.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:21.090 align:middle line:84%
But the importance of what
you're doing with these films

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.040 align:middle line:84%
is for people who have
a hard time getting

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.690 align:middle line:84%
their mind around it is to
give them proof positive.

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:28.530 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's go to
a clip from "Scole.

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:30.300 align:middle line:90%
The Afterlife Experiment."

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:31.980 align:middle line:90%
And this went on for--

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:33.605 align:middle line:84%
how many years was
this experiment?

00:32:33.605 --> 00:32:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: Five years.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Five years.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:35.888 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: 500 sessions.

00:32:35.888 --> 00:32:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 500 sessions
in Scole, England.

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: Scole, England it's
a small town, about a half hour

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Northeast of Cambridge.

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: And this took place
between about 1994 and 1999,

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:48.630 align:middle line:84%
that period of
time, 500 sessions.

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:51.810 align:middle line:84%
For two years,
the experiment was

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:55.030 align:middle line:84%
observed by three properly
skeptical investigators.

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: Anyway, you'll
see it all in the film.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, let's take a look.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:32:59.130 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The Scole Experiment was
reported in contemporary

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:06.150 align:middle line:84%
magazine articles, two books,
a 400-page scientific report,

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and a full length
documentary film.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.250 align:middle line:10%
Its successes included
nearly 1,000 hours

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:15.800 align:middle line:10%
of direct communication
through the mediums

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.250 align:middle line:10%
and an impressive variety of
intriguing physical phenomena,

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:23.660 align:middle line:10%
such as tiny animated lights
that flew around the room.

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.640 align:middle line:84%
The Scole group
also witnessed what

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.895 align:middle line:84%
they claim to be the spontaneous
appearance of physical objects.

00:33:28.895 --> 00:33:37.720 align:middle line:90%


00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.030 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps the most
astonishing of these objects

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:43.240 align:middle line:10%
were these newspapers, which
arrived in mint condition,

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:50.350 align:middle line:10%
despite having been
published in the 1940s.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:54.070 align:middle line:10%
>> We took it to the leading
research station in the world

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:58.180 align:middle line:10%
on paper and printing, and
it was absolutely clear from

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:01.570 align:middle line:10%
their report that this was a
genuine article which appeared

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:04.300 align:middle line:10%
50 years after the event, and
no one has been able to explain

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.290 align:middle line:10%
how it got there.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:08.139 align:middle line:90%


00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:10.210 align:middle line:10%
In other sessions,
a video camera

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:12.040 align:middle line:10%
loaded with brand
new blank tapes

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.929 align:middle line:10%
and switched on
in a darkened room

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:17.395 align:middle line:10%
produced an amazing series
of colorful abstract frames.

00:34:17.395 --> 00:34:23.639 align:middle line:90%


00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:27.210 align:middle line:10%
The tapes also contained
unexplained light phenomena

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:28.755 align:middle line:10%
and enigmatic faces.

00:34:28.755 --> 00:34:43.110 align:middle line:90%


00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.480 align:middle line:10%
A conventional
35-millimeter film camera

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.610 align:middle line:10%
placed on the table
in their darkened room

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:50.699 align:middle line:10%
initially produced a series
of black and white images

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:52.530 align:middle line:10%
that the Scole
group were told were

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:55.180 align:middle line:10%
faithful duplicates of existing
photographs from around

00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:55.980 align:middle line:10%
the world.

00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:02.710 align:middle line:90%


00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:06.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Some were photos of
existing photos, and they said,

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.300 align:middle line:10%
initially, that was easier for
them to do before they went

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.510 align:middle line:10%
on to photos that
had never existed.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Continuing photographic
experiments using isolated

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:19.870 align:middle line:84%
rolls of film and no camera
were carefully controlled

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:21.880 align:middle line:84%
by the independent
investigators.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>> We would buy
the film ourselves.

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:26.420 align:middle line:90%
We would load it into a box.

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:30.260 align:middle line:84%
The box was held in the
hands of the investigators

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:32.530 align:middle line:90%
so that no one could get at it.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, immediately
afterwards,

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:36.460 align:middle line:84%
we would take it out
of the box ourselves

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:39.670 align:middle line:84%
so that no one else touched it
and then develop it ourselves

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.830 align:middle line:90%
in a special machine.

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:44.740 align:middle line:10%
>> To everyone's surprise,
these films revealed a stunning

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.720 align:middle line:10%
variety of content.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.950 align:middle line:10%
This included whimsical
drawings and symbols, diagrams,

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:56.580 align:middle line:10%
writings, and poetry
in multiple languages,

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.830 align:middle line:10%
as well as portraits
and signatures

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.420 align:middle line:10%
of known individuals.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:15.100 align:middle line:90%


00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
that's irrefutable.

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:20.120 align:middle line:90%
I just found it fascinating--

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so much of it,
but also the notion of you

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:26.380 align:middle line:84%
have film that's in containers
still and then being developed

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:27.830 align:middle line:90%
having these images on them.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So I think we don't have to
argue the point something's

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.400 align:middle line:84%
happening on the
other side anymore.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: I'm especially
intrigued with the films

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:39.290 align:middle line:84%
because, of course, the raw
film is rolled up, right?

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: So there's got to be
a very different relationship

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:48.170 align:middle line:84%
between the other side
and physical space.

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:52.450 align:middle line:84%
It's hard for us to imagine how
they're able to energetically

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:54.610 align:middle line:90%
imprint in this way.

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: I find it
entertaining, mind-blowing,

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:58.430 align:middle line:90%
fascinating.

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I find it
all of the above, too.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.520 align:middle line:84%
So you still
communicate with Jane?

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: I do.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Though, in recent years, it's
been through a team of mediums

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:06.640 align:middle line:90%
that I work with.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.990 align:middle line:90%
And so, what is her position?

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:10.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because this
has been since 2007,

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.010 align:middle line:84%
so it's been quite
a few years now.

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Why is she continuing to
come through and speak

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.480 align:middle line:90%
with all of you?

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: Well, she
comes through, as well

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:20.330 align:middle line:84%
as some other deceased
friends of mine,

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:22.770 align:middle line:84%
through this team of
mediums that I work with.

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And to me, the most
fascinating thing

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:29.300 align:middle line:84%
is to get a sense of
the different phases

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.210 align:middle line:84%
that folks go through
after they pass.

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Again, each one is
individual, but there

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:39.050 align:middle line:84%
are definite differences in
the flavor of their presence,

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:41.780 align:middle line:84%
where they're coming
from, their language,

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.540 align:middle line:84%
where words are
involved, and so on,

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.050 align:middle line:90%
how they express themselves.

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:49.340 align:middle line:84%
One of the most fascinating,
heartbreaking but fascinating

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.930 align:middle line:84%
things to me, was I was
with Jane when she passed.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And she left her body about 10
hours before the body expired.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: And the
difference was stark,

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:00.780 align:middle line:90%
and it taught me so much.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:04.978 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: When she left, the
body was like an automaton.

00:38:04.978 --> 00:38:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's like clay.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.520 align:middle line:84%
That's what happened
with my mother.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: It still had
its primitive reactions

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.240 align:middle line:90%
and response--

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:11.495 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Breathing.

00:38:11.495 --> 00:38:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: --breathing, and
I could ask a question,

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:16.730 align:middle line:90%
but the response was blunt.

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:19.800 align:middle line:90%
Like, uh, that's sort of thing.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.433 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: So something
was really different.

00:38:22.433 --> 00:38:24.200 align:middle line:84%
I really got that she
was no longer there.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And the first time that
I had the opportunity

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:29.900 align:middle line:84%
to speak with her I was
actually on the phone

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:31.400 align:middle line:90%
with one of my medium friends.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.500 align:middle line:90%
And she says, oh, Jane is here.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I'll just hear her
words, and I'll

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.910 align:middle line:84%
translate and let you
know what she says,

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:41.390 align:middle line:84%
whereupon, Jane pushes
the medium out of the way.

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking to
Jane on the phone.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I love it.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.720 align:middle line:84%
You could hear her
clearly, too, right?

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Because some of them,
it's a little bit garbled.

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: This is just coming
through the medium's own voice.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: So it was perfect.

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: Oh, yeah, of course.

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.360 align:middle line:10%
OK, but it was a two
way conversation,

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.820 align:middle line:10%
as if she were there on
the other end of the phone.

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.470 align:middle line:10%
And one of the
first things I asked

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:04.580 align:middle line:10%
her was, it was my impression
that you left your body

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.930 align:middle line:10%
before the body expired.

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And she says, yes,
that's absolutely true.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:10.040 align:middle line:90%
I said, why.?

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And she said, because
I couldn't stand to see

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.590 align:middle line:90%
you see me in that condition.

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.240 align:middle line:84%
She didn't want to be
witness to it anymore.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.970 align:middle line:10%
>>DRASIN: And that was one
of many brief but intense

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:24.400 align:middle line:10%
opportunity to discuss.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.880 align:middle line:10%
It, to me, was a
priceless experience.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was a gift.

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.035 align:middle line:84%
Well, because we're
about out of time now,

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:33.160 align:middle line:84%
and I highly encourage
people to watch these films,

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.743 align:middle line:84%
now they can find
one on Vimeo, right?

00:39:34.743 --> 00:39:36.368 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: Being found
in both on Vimeo.

00:39:36.368 --> 00:39:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Both on Vimeo.

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:38.250 align:middle line:90%
YouTube?

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:39.160 align:middle line:90%
Anything on YouTube?

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: The older version
of "The Scole" movie,

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.362 align:middle line:84%
which was called "The Afterlife
Experiments" is on YouTube.

00:39:44.362 --> 00:39:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
upgraded new on--

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: The updated, what
we call the director's cut,

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:48.880 align:middle line:90%
is on Vimeo.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Vimeo.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.460 align:middle line:90%
So "Calling Earth" and "Scole.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.590 align:middle line:84%
The Afterlife Experiment"
are both on Vimeo.

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:53.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: Right.

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And they're free.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: They're free.

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
absolutely fabulous.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: And they run
about an hour and a half.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And before we go,
you had in your book,

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and I just have to put it in
because I love it so much.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.420 align:middle line:90%
I took the quote from your book.

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:07.120 align:middle line:84%
"Whoever undertakes
to set himself up

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.640 align:middle line:84%
as judge of truth
and knowledge is

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:14.380 align:middle line:84%
shipwrecked by the laughter
of the gods," Albert Einstein.

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Because till the end, he
remained open minded to truth.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Whatever truth would like
to show itself to him.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DRASIN: Yes.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:22.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.433 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts
before we go, Dan?

00:40:24.433 --> 00:40:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DRASIN: Well,
speaking of truth,

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:28.040 align:middle line:84%
I think truth is
a moving target.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Science is open-ended.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:34.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of continually
unfolding discovery,

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.645 align:middle line:90%
and I think Einstein got that.

00:40:36.645 --> 00:40:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think he
definitely got it.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:39.218 align:middle line:90%
He lived it.

00:40:39.218 --> 00:40:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Dan, thank you so
much, and thank you

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.385 align:middle line:84%
for making these
beautiful films, which

00:40:42.385 --> 00:40:44.870 align:middle line:84%
I know our audience is going
to be sharing with their loved

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:48.110 align:middle line:84%
ones, who might have questions
about this phenomenon,

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:49.640 align:middle line:90%
whether afterlife exists or not.

so much, Regina.

>>REGINA: Again, for a
succinct and clear argument

00:40:52.863 --> 00:40:55.560 align:middle line:10%
for consciousness extending
not only beyond life,

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.440 align:middle line:10%
but as the foundation
of everything,

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.800 align:middle line:10%
pick up a copy of Dan's book,
a new science of the afterlife.
