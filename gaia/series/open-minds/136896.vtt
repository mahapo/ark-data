00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.550 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Many
of us have given up

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.580 align:middle line:10%
faith in the medical industry,
having been misled and even

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.170 align:middle line:10%
mistreated by the institution.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:84%
But every now and
then, we meet someone

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:84%
with such exceptional
skills that it gives hope.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Donese Worden
is our newest find.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.040 align:middle line:84%
As a naturopathic
physician, her ability

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.490 align:middle line:84%
to diagnose and treat in a
holistic manner is laudable.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.340 align:middle line:84%
We'll have two hours with her to
speak about the truth of cancer

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:90%
treatment and energy medicine.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Donese, I'm so happy
to have you here.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE WORDEN: Thank you,
I'm excited to be here.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, thank you to
our mutual contact, Sandy,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.960 align:middle line:84%
who does a very similar thing to
what I do and is in publishing,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.910 align:middle line:90%
and she introduced us.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And you're unique, in that
you never stop researching.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.660 align:middle line:90%
You never stop learning.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think, maybe, this is
one of the biggest problems

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:84%
that people have with the
medical industry and doctors

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
at large, is that they
appear to get out of school.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And then the
education after that

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.710 align:middle line:84%
is whatever the
pharmaceutical companies pay

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:84%
for them to have,
and go on a junket,

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:90%
and learn a thing or two.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:90%
That's not you.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well, and in defense
of those physicians that are

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.340 align:middle line:90%
stuck within that broken model--

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.140 align:middle line:10%
>>WORDEN: Right, they've got
five to seven minutes with you.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.470 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:10%
>>WORDEN: They don't have time.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.600 align:middle line:10%
They're worn out at
the end of the day.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.740 align:middle line:10%
They're exhausted,
and then they have

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.870 align:middle line:10%
to rely on those pharmaceutical
reps to come in and say,

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:10%
here's the new drug.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.670 align:middle line:10%
Here's how to use
it and prescribe it.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.575 align:middle line:84%
And you have a minute, just
to tell your one complaint.

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And let's try a
drug and hope you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.116 align:middle line:90%
don't have any side effects.

00:01:51.116 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a good way to
do medicine, absolutely not.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say
it's not necessarily--

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.840 align:middle line:84%
if they're just looking to
have a sane life at an HMO,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and not have to work
80 hours a week,

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.030 align:middle line:84%
then it's a model that
works for the doctor.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a model that
works for the patient.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.946 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's true.

00:02:08.946 --> 00:02:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And I will say, a
lot of physicians

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.580 align:middle line:84%
are saying it doesn't
work for them either.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:84%
They're frustrated, and
they're tired of working

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:15.994 align:middle line:90%
within that model as well.

00:02:15.994 --> 00:02:18.159 align:middle line:84%
They know they can't get
to the root of the problem.

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:84%
They know they can't spend
the time that they want.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's good to know,

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.000 align:middle line:84%
that they're having
the frustration.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid of doctors.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:90%
Literally, I'm afraid of them.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So you stay out
of the doctor's office

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.130 align:middle line:90%
if you want to be well, right?

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.835 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I just stay
away from them.

00:02:30.835 --> 00:02:32.040 align:middle line:90%
But someone like you--

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.530 align:middle line:84%
so let's talk about
your background

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.330 align:middle line:84%
a little bit, because,
again, you're a researcher.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.060 align:middle line:90%
You're a naturopathic physician.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:84%
You really blend the
best of both worlds,

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.130 align:middle line:84%
looking out for the absolute
highest potential of healing

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.680 align:middle line:90%
for your patients and others.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And you also have a
website, so you guide people

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.850 align:middle line:90%
that way as well.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.155 align:middle line:90%
That's not always one on one.

00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right, yes.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.931 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And women, the
place of women in this--

00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:57.150 align:middle line:84%
because this is a face
that's been missing a lot.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And I do
think we are missing

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:90%
the female face of medicine.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.790 align:middle line:84%
When I say that, I'm
not saying male-female.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying using intuition
and using that loving,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:84%
nurturing facility that--
we've forgotten what

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.810 align:middle line:90%
physician and doctor means.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:90%
It means healer and teacher.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.850 align:middle line:84%
We're not doing that
in medicine anymore.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.020 align:middle line:90%
That takes time.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.330 align:middle line:84%
That takes one-on-one
with a patient.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And that means they
have to pay cash.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And now we're in
another issue of,

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.955 align:middle line:84%
how many patients can
afford to do that?

00:03:26.955 --> 00:03:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.686 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: But the
best medicine is

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:32.320 align:middle line:84%
using the physician and
the patient's intuition,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.279 align:middle line:90%
healing, and listening.

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:34.236 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're right.

00:03:34.236 --> 00:03:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And that does seem to
be almost completely

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:84%
gone if you're into
institutionalized insurance

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.570 align:middle line:90%
coverage.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.906 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk
about that whole part

00:03:41.906 --> 00:03:45.390 align:middle line:84%
right there, just the
notion that the mandate

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.800 align:middle line:84%
to be covered by insurance
is often cutting us off

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:90%
from our own good.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And take a little
time to tell us

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.934 align:middle line:90%
what's really going on there.

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well, you know
what I tell patients?

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:84%
The way that I see
insurance, and what

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:84%
I think it's most beneficial
for, is catastrophic care.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:90%
Get a high deductible.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.650 align:middle line:84%
If you break your leg or we've
got some major, major illness

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.860 align:middle line:84%
that requires surgery,
get that deductible

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.364 align:middle line:84%
that you can cover,
and let modern medicine

00:04:13.364 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and traditional
medicine do what it does

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.339 align:middle line:90%
best, which is emergency care.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Anything in between
that, save your money,

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.139 align:middle line:84%
and let's do preventive
and natural medicine.

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's figure out what the
root of the problem is.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Take the time to
figure that out.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what is the best way
for you to heal and do that.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.800 align:middle line:84%
So insurance has
its place, but I

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.900 align:middle line:84%
think its best place is in
emergency or critical care.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's hard to find--

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.590 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes, it's hard to
find a policy, though,

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:84%
that allows you
to have just that.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Well, you can.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.890 align:middle line:84%
You can get your
large deductible.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.100 align:middle line:90%
And that means that you--

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.349 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: $5,000 or something?

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Whatever you
decide, $2,500, $5,000,

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.370 align:middle line:84%
they even have
$10,000 deductibles.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Deductibles.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Whatever you think,
if something major happened,

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.210 align:middle line:90%
can I take--

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Catastrophic care.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And in
between that, you've

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.100 align:middle line:84%
saved up money, per month, that
you would have been putting

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:84%
into a model that you
don't necessarily adhere to

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:84%
or want to go, to go get
these traditional looks.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Save that money, and go to your
natural practitioner that's

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.700 align:middle line:84%
going to be talking to you
about your holistic view of how

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.420 align:middle line:84%
you should be living
your life or health.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right--

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.048 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk
about you a little bit,

00:05:19.048 --> 00:05:22.000 align:middle line:84%
because you've done research
with some major institutions,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.800 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With Mayo, Duke,
American Academy of Pain

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.640 align:middle line:90%
Management--

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.890 align:middle line:84%
let's get into how you
ended up in the place

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.310 align:middle line:84%
you are now, because it's
as though you can really

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.590 align:middle line:84%
address almost any kind
of medical condition,

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.140 align:middle line:84%
because you've poked around
in it or done research there.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well, if I don't
know it, I want to know it.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: I guess that's
just innate in my nature.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.143 align:middle line:84%
I will say, you have
to be a little bit--

00:05:44.143 --> 00:05:45.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
say crazy or nuts,

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.490 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get up
at 3 AM every morning

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:84%
and start looking through
science and research, to say,

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:90%
what's new?

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.209 align:middle line:90%
What do I not know?

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
preface this, though,

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:84%
that the more I know, the
more I research, the more I

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.770 align:middle line:84%
understand, the more I realize
we really don't understand.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.010 align:middle line:84%
We don't know a lot on
both sides of medicine.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.259 align:middle line:84%
That's where my
message is always,

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:08.550 align:middle line:90%
what's coming from the patient?

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.460 align:middle line:84%
How do I get that patient to the
state where their own body can

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.660 align:middle line:84%
heal, because it's the
best pharmacy, in the best

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:84%
amount, the right dosage,
no side effects, when

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.360 align:middle line:84%
your own pharmacy
can be activated.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.030 align:middle line:84%
So I learned both
systems of medicine--

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.320 align:middle line:90%
traditional and alternative--

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
tell us your story.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.946 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Look at the
research and say--

00:06:27.946 --> 00:06:30.029 align:middle line:84%
well, I think that I
started really getting

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:32.070 align:middle line:84%
into the research, not
just because of my nature,

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:84%
but because, especially
in alternative medicine,

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:84%
we haven't done a very
good job on researching

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.639 align:middle line:90%
what needs to be researched.

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple of
reasons for that.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.638 align:middle line:84%
If we're looking
at a nutraceutical

00:06:43.638 --> 00:06:46.290 align:middle line:84%
or a natural treatment,
you can't patent that.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.780 align:middle line:84%
So who's going to put
in millions of dollars

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.510 align:middle line:84%
to study something
that they can't patent?

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:90%
So understood, right?

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.560 align:middle line:84%
But we, in the NIH,
that are supposed

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.310 align:middle line:84%
to be giving monies toward
alternative treatments--

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle line:90%
and they are.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.640 align:middle line:84%
They're doing more
mind-body type things,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.250 align:middle line:84%
but they're not necessarily
giving a lot of money

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.726 align:middle line:90%
to nutraceuticals as well.

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which,
now, those would

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.080 align:middle line:84%
be considered to be more
in direct competition

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:90%
with pharmaceuticals.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.006 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And whatever their
reasoning or their purpose is,

00:07:14.006 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and we could debate
that all day long--

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.370 align:middle line:90%
what that really looks like--

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:84%
but I will say that, from
the nutraceutical side--

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.350 align:middle line:90%
and I do do formulation.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I work with some
very good companies

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.240 align:middle line:84%
that are about quality
control, about looking

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.700 align:middle line:84%
at the raw materials,
doing the testing they need

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:84%
to on those nutraceuticals,
because we've gotten

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.030 align:middle line:84%
a black eye on that end,
rightly so, for having lead

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.990 align:middle line:84%
and arsenic in products,
not doing the testing

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.210 align:middle line:84%
and getting inferior
quality in there.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.540 align:middle line:84%
So you get the black
eye that this is not

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.520 align:middle line:90%
regulated like pharmaceuticals.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.080 align:middle line:90%
It's regulated as drugs.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of inferior
quality has gotten through.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.050 align:middle line:90%
So we deserve that black eye.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
a lot of companies

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.880 align:middle line:84%
that are doing it correctly,
that are doing the testing.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.782 align:middle line:84%
And they're willing
to do some research.

00:08:01.782 --> 00:08:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And I've done some for
some of those companies.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.090 align:middle line:90%
Being able to look at--

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
talk about that.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.689 align:middle line:84%
What kind of research
have you done?

00:08:06.689 --> 00:08:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Right, so
the first steps always

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.800 align:middle line:84%
are toxicity studies
to say, is it

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:90%
going to be harmful for liver?

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:90%
What can we do?

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.269 align:middle line:84%
We look at some of the
traditional remedies that

00:08:16.269 --> 00:08:18.810 align:middle line:84%
have been used for many, many
years-- for thousands of years,

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.000 align:middle line:84%
sometimes-- and say,
we know they work.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.920 align:middle line:90%
We think they're safe.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.270 align:middle line:90%
Now let's prove it.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at it, and
let's do the testing

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.630 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be done.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, whenever they
get active ingredients

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.740 align:middle line:84%
in a nutraceutical,
and they think

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.169 align:middle line:84%
that they can have a
proprietary delivery system,

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.210 align:middle line:84%
now it's worth them
putting some dollars

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.520 align:middle line:90%
into a study to look at that.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and
so what were you

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.419 align:middle line:84%
doing with these various
institutions I mentioned

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:43.710 align:middle line:90%
earlier, what kind of research?

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well, we
have one right now.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.090 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it's
still going forward.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:84%
We have an enzyme,
systemic enzymes.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.720 align:middle line:84%
No one's really looked at
the mechanism of action

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.240 align:middle line:84%
of that particular
type of a nutraceutical

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.690 align:middle line:90%
and what that would be doing.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:84%
We know what individual
enzymes do, kind of.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: We also have not
looked at when we combine them.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So we have a lot
of those out there,

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.720 align:middle line:90%
and people are feeling better.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.030 align:middle line:90%
Their pain is better.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.750 align:middle line:90%
Their autoimmune is better.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.520 align:middle line:84%
They know the
enzymes are working.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.440 align:middle line:90%
We're not exactly sure how.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
companies hired

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
me to design clinical
research for that,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.200 align:middle line:84%
to look at their particular--
because they have

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.420 align:middle line:90%
a proprietary delivery system.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So now they've got
something that they can say,

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.040 align:middle line:84%
it's worth putting money
into our delivery system.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:90%
Look at the enzyme.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And we were all a
little surprised

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.780 align:middle line:84%
that a major institution, in
this case it's Mayo Clinic,

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.650 align:middle line:90%
said, yes.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.300 align:middle line:90%
We will do this.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's funded by a
nutraceutical company.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:84%
But now we're
starting to see some

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:84%
of those institutions partnering
with the nutraceutical

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.210 align:middle line:84%
companies, which a few years
ago, you would have not heard

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:57.840 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.530 align:middle line:90%
It didn't exist.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:58.875 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:09:58.875 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Nobody--
they were hands-off.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.890 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
work with you, and we

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:02.880 align:middle line:90%
don't want to work with you.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.838 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is good.

00:10:03.838 --> 00:10:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: It's
very good to start

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.960 align:middle line:84%
that conversation, where there
are open arms, and saying,

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.260 align:middle line:90%
listen.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.295 align:middle line:84%
If you can fund it through
the nutraceuticals,

00:10:10.295 --> 00:10:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and we've looked
at the research,

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and we know that it's safe and
all, we too are interested.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So I'm excited about
that possibility.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: MD Anderson is
looking at some studies

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.120 align:middle line:90%
that we're looking at as well.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.330 align:middle line:90%
So the doors are opening.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's really coming from the
physicians and the researchers,

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.910 align:middle line:84%
of saying, we want
to look at this.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And they know the failings
of our traditional medicine

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.960 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.490 align:middle line:90%
We know it's gotten to--

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:37.380 align:middle line:90%
we have hope.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.800 align:middle line:84%
We have research that's going
along the traditional end.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.190 align:middle line:90%
That's not stopping.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.600 align:middle line:84%
They're still excited
and working on that end.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.800 align:middle line:84%
But they're also
saying, we do need

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.650 align:middle line:84%
to look into the natural
world, because our patients are

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.950 align:middle line:84%
reporting to us that, even when
they chose traditional care

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:53.760 align:middle line:90%
in cancer--

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.699 align:middle line:90%
is a good example.

00:10:54.699 --> 00:10:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And they've got these
horrible side effects

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:84%
that they know are going to
happen with certain chemos.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.980 align:middle line:84%
But if they're on certain types
of alpha lipoic acid and all,

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.290 align:middle line:84%
they're not seeing those
patients have those reactions

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:04.930 align:middle line:90%
that they expected.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.233 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So they're
still seeing most

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:08.700 align:middle line:90%
of the natural as an adjunct.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's do it to help them
from the side effects.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:84%
But we really don't see it
as the real medicine yet.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So it hasn't crossed
that boundary.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.384 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Traditional
oncologists

00:11:20.384 --> 00:11:22.800 align:middle line:84%
are still seeing the chemo,
the radiation, and the surgery

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.330 align:middle line:90%
as an actual medicine.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.281 align:middle line:84%
And we can do these other things
and say we're integrative.

00:11:27.281 --> 00:11:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To be complementary.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: To be
complimentary, but not

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.577 align:middle line:90%
as treatments in themselves.

00:11:32.577 --> 00:11:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The actual
treatment itself, yeah.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Right, and that's
where I think, in time,

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.650 align:middle line:84%
we are going to be able to
show, and we are showing,

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:45.010 align:middle line:84%
some of those alternative
treatments, in their own right,

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.260 align:middle line:90%
are working on--

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.718 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, no,
that's exciting.

00:11:47.718 --> 00:11:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And also, the reason we're
even doing this little series

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:57.000 align:middle line:84%
of shows is to let people know
they don't have to be terrified

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.320 align:middle line:90%
of cancer anymore.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to take
more and more people

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.010 align:middle line:84%
to come forward,
like you, and choose

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.140 align:middle line:84%
to commit their career
in this direction,

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.540 align:middle line:84%
just to have access to
them, no less if you're

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.207 align:middle line:84%
stuck in the system
with insurance only.

00:12:08.207 --> 00:12:09.165 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:12:09.165 --> 00:12:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, that's
where it gets a little bit

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.600 align:middle line:90%
hopeless for a lot of people.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.320 align:middle line:84%
They may not have the
funds available to take

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.480 align:middle line:90%
care of themselves in that way.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at
the-- you just talked

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:84%
about the nutraceutical part
partnering with institutions.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Are we seeing a shift
in the percentage of MDs

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.550 align:middle line:84%
that come out that choose to
go the naturopathic route?

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: I think that we are.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.880 align:middle line:90%
There are several groups.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.470 align:middle line:84%
There's functional
medicine groups.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:84%
There are integrative oncology
groups that are coming out,

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.440 align:middle line:84%
that are using traditional
MDs that are saying,

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.530 align:middle line:90%
I want to learn more.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:90%
I need to know more about that.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And I want to utilize it in
my practice, with my patients.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.660 align:middle line:84%
So yes, those
groups are growing.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.530 align:middle line:90%
I lecture a lot.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.320 align:middle line:84%
I do continuing medical
education for those groups,

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.050 align:middle line:84%
because they want
to know about, what

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.240 align:middle line:84%
is out there that
can actually help

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:84%
and may complement what
they're already doing?

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.149 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you are
seeing, as you said,

00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:03.440 align:middle line:84%
the interest is picking up
among the medical community.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Right, Society
for Integrative Oncology,

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.750 align:middle line:84%
they're very research oriented,
but they're very interested

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.880 align:middle line:84%
in the alternatives
and in mind-body.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And they are doing research
and interested in doing so.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.906 align:middle line:90%
There's the integrative--

00:13:17.906 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say it wrong,
all the acronyms that come.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's an-- well,
best answer for cancer.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.500 align:middle line:84%
They're tied into
another group of this.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And so there are quite a
few out there, right now,

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.299 align:middle line:84%
that are starting to really
look and want to learn.

00:13:31.299 --> 00:13:32.715 align:middle line:84%
That's coming from
the physicians.

00:13:32.715 --> 00:13:34.256 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Good, OK--
all right, well,

00:13:34.256 --> 00:13:36.000 align:middle line:84%
let's launch into
the cancer story.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.820 align:middle line:84%
You know that I've already
interviewed Travis Christopher,

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.710 align:middle line:84%
who's kind of laid
the foundation

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:44.160 align:middle line:84%
of the history of
cancer treatment,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:90%
starting in the 1700s, right?

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you went up
through Dr. Warburg, right?

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.418 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
where we start

00:13:53.418 --> 00:13:55.982 align:middle line:84%
getting into the metabolic
effects in cancer.

00:13:55.982 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But before
we start going

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.610 align:middle line:84%
into that part of the story from
a deep medical point of view,

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to take a look at
epigenetics, because it almost

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.992 align:middle line:90%
precedes the story.

00:14:06.992 --> 00:14:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes, it does.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:10.710 align:middle line:84%
So we get caught
into-- first, if we're

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:14.336 align:middle line:84%
talking about cancer, 1% to
2% of cancers are genetic.

00:14:14.336 --> 00:14:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And all of our dollars
are going there,

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.170 align:middle line:84%
which I'm sure Travis and you
had a very good conversation

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.560 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.150 align:middle line:84%
But the epigenetic
piece is the ability

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:84%
of the body to work around
that blueprint, those genes.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Just because you
have a gene does not

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.670 align:middle line:84%
mean that it needs to
express in a negative way.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.130 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability
to turn off bad genes

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.660 align:middle line:90%
and turn on the good ones.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's our lifestyle,
that's our mindset,

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.790 align:middle line:84%
all the things that
you are talking

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.410 align:middle line:90%
about with all of your guests.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.900 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to
work with epigenetics.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So when patients come in
and say, I've got this gene,

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.710 align:middle line:84%
or all of my family
have had this, at most,

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:57.210 align:middle line:84%
most genetic disorders
are-- or I will say genes.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.970 align:middle line:84%
You've got 30%, at most,
that that's really going

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:90%
to cause it to express or not.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.720 align:middle line:90%
We can play with the other 70%.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.100 align:middle line:90%
You're in charge.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Even though your blueprint
may look a certain way,

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:11.280 align:middle line:84%
we can express that
blueprint differently.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's empowering
to the patients,

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.930 align:middle line:84%
to say it's interesting
to look at your genetics.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:90%
And I do genetic testing.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.264 align:middle line:90%
I like to look there.

00:15:18.264 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what the
blueprint looks like as much

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.600 align:middle line:90%
as I can look at.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.580 align:middle line:84%
But then I don't
want to dwell there.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Now we want to look
at, what can we

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.810 align:middle line:84%
do about making you
healthier around those genes?

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does the genetic
testing that you do kind of

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.130 align:middle line:84%
give you some kind of direction
in what type of therapies

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.810 align:middle line:84%
can work, or simply that this
is more likely to express?

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Both, but
we're getting better.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.260 align:middle line:84%
There are inexpensive
ways to look

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.690 align:middle line:84%
at your whole genetic
genome profile, right?

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Then you plug them into
different programs like

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.750 align:middle line:84%
[? Porteus ? ], and 23,
and what's the other one?

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 23AndMe?

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well, that's
giving you your whole, big--

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.075 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
the big one, right.

00:15:55.075 --> 00:15:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Right,
then you plug it

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.710 align:middle line:84%
into nutrigenomics
and these others,

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.680 align:middle line:84%
that it's analyzing it, from
a nutritional standpoint,

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.890 align:middle line:90%
a little bit better.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:04.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not 100%.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:05.610 align:middle line:90%
We can get better.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:09.480 align:middle line:84%
But it gives us, on the clinical
side, a little more information

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:90%
to say, OK.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:14.220 align:middle line:84%
I think that maybe you should be
doing more aerobic exercise, as

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.810 align:middle line:90%
opposed to strength training.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Or you might need
a little different ratio

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:84%
in your diet than we
would have thought about.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And so it just allows me to
tailor it a little closer,

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:27.634 align:middle line:90%
from an epigenetic standpoint.

00:16:27.634 --> 00:16:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So Bruce
Lipton's work--

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:29.760 align:middle line:90%
I interviewed Bruce.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes, he's amazing.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think I did
the very first video

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.770 align:middle line:84%
interview with Bruce, when
his book first came out.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And we just had a
lovely conversation,

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and it started sparking
interest in the public.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
now he's blown up.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes, rightly so.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
interesting thing,

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:84%
as you say, someone
comes in and says,

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.550 align:middle line:84%
all the women in
my family have had

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:90%
this particular kind of cancer.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
it, again, going back

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.240 align:middle line:84%
to what you were saying, and
from the epigenetic point

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:84%
of view, mind-body, is
that whole family may also

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:84%
have a very specific
imprint, emotionally, they

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.390 align:middle line:84%
pass on from daughter,
to daughter, to daughter.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Absolutely, and
when fear is embedded in that,

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:84%
then that's a very
strong indicator

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.190 align:middle line:84%
that we can turn
on those bad genes,

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.760 align:middle line:84%
so those genes that may make
us more likely to express

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.109 align:middle line:90%
some kind of cancer.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So going back to
letting go of the fear

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.387 align:middle line:84%
is a very big piece,
especially in cancer.

00:17:21.387 --> 00:17:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so you
said that off camera.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.621 align:middle line:84%
You said we can't heal when
we're in a state of fear.

00:17:25.621 --> 00:17:26.579 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:28.954 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And of course, as
soon as someone gets a cancer

00:17:28.954 --> 00:17:30.897 align:middle line:90%
diagnosis, fear takes over.

00:17:30.897 --> 00:17:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And that's a big piece
of what I see in my practice.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And I expressed to you that
I'm actually writing a book,

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.220 align:middle line:90%
because I'm so strongly--

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I need to reach more
people with this message,

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.670 align:middle line:84%
is that they will come
in and say, Dr. Worden,

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I have just been diagnosed
with a certain type of cancer.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:51.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm already scheduled for
surgery, chemotherapy,

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:51.980 align:middle line:90%
radiation.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Within minutes.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And I don't
even know my doctors.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Or they've met them and
say, I don't like them.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel good.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm unempowered, I'm afraid.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.140 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And so my message is, unless
that cancer is pushing

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.010 align:middle line:84%
on an organ that's affecting
you right now, right here,

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.360 align:middle line:84%
you're going to give
yourself 72 hours.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And in those 72 hours,
here's a game plan,

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.760 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to put your
pieces together so you're out

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.370 align:middle line:90%
of this fear, you're empowered.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:18.990 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to become a doctor.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.900 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to understand
all the therapies available.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:27.690 align:middle line:84%
But you are going to be powerful
in choosing the physicians

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:31.110 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to put
your life in their hands

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.440 align:middle line:90%
and your therapies.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.850 align:middle line:84%
What makes sense to you, and
knowing that your intuition is

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.280 align:middle line:84%
very important,
because when you look

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.890 align:middle line:84%
at the science in both
alternative medicine

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and traditional medicine, we
have weaknesses on both sides--

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:49.200 align:middle line:84%
we don't have 100%
cure on either side,

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.270 align:middle line:90%
for any types of cancer.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So understanding that, and
understanding the strengths

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.550 align:middle line:90%
and weaknesses of both sides--

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:59.640 align:middle line:84%
that power lies within
you, to be able to say,

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to listen.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to choose.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go in
with what I have chosen

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.414 align:middle line:84%
feeling like I chose it, and I
believe in it, because patients

00:19:09.414 --> 00:19:10.830 align:middle line:84%
will say, well,
what would you do?

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And I say, but what
I believe is not

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.970 align:middle line:84%
as important as
what you believe,

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.370 align:middle line:84%
because I may personally
believe that surgery

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:20.940 align:middle line:84%
would be a very good thing
for me, right here, right now.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.830 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
believe that, and you

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:27.240 align:middle line:84%
go in with what you were
talking about in fear,

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.210 align:middle line:90%
and I don't like it.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.543 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I even want to
do it, I don't believe it--

00:19:30.543 --> 00:19:33.270 align:middle line:84%
you're not in a state
for the body to heal.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:37.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you've chosen it, don't
second-question yourself.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Don't go back and, what
if I'd done this or not?

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:40.210 align:middle line:90%
No, choose.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Make a direction.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can always
adjust it, as you go.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.363 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: You can
adjust it as you go.

00:19:44.363 --> 00:19:46.110 align:middle line:84%
But when you've
chosen, you believe it.

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you have personally
chosen chemotherapy,

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.500 align:middle line:84%
if you are sitting there with
an IV in your arm and thinking,

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.900 align:middle line:84%
this is poison,
this is killing me,

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.690 align:middle line:84%
it's killing my
healthy cells, that is

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.410 align:middle line:90%
destructive in its own right.

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.418 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: If you're going
to choose chemotherapy, you

00:20:02.418 --> 00:20:04.530 align:middle line:84%
need to thank it
for what it's doing

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and be talking to your
healthy cells to say,

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.280 align:middle line:90%
let me keep you healthy.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.738 align:middle line:84%
Let me do the things
that are going

00:20:09.738 --> 00:20:12.870 align:middle line:84%
to help you be all right
with this, regardless

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.522 align:middle line:90%
of my personal decision.

00:20:15.522 --> 00:20:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And I help them look
at their statistics.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.024 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: You have
this type of cancer.

00:20:19.024 --> 00:20:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Here's what chemotherapy can do.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Look at those statistics
closely to make your decision,

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:26.830 align:middle line:84%
because most of the time,
they're not very good.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, they're not.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Right?

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: But if
that person is really

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.860 align:middle line:84%
tied into a mindset of
traditional medicine,

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:38.162 align:middle line:84%
and they believe that
that is their cure,

00:20:38.162 --> 00:20:39.620 align:middle line:84%
then I need to stay
out of the way,

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.600 align:middle line:84%
and so does every
other physician.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Stay out of the way of
their belief system,

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.210 align:middle line:84%
because if they
truly believe it,

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.850 align:middle line:84%
I personally believe
that is powerful.

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:53.077 align:middle line:84%
And that has ability to
heal, even if it's toxic,

00:20:53.077 --> 00:20:55.410 align:middle line:84%
and I thought there might
have been something different.

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: I educate them in
all of it, in both sides.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I put it back
into their ball park

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is the
responsible thing to do--

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:84%
it's a shame that
not all physicians

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:84%
are trained in the way you
are, and understand it the way

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:10.450 align:middle line:90%
you do.

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:14.240 align:middle line:84%
But that said, this is--
it's not a digression.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.090 align:middle line:84%
It's something that I think
needs to be explained.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.590 align:middle line:84%
To the best of
your ability, what

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:23.900 align:middle line:84%
is the actual chemical cascade
of fear on the blood acidity

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:24.860 align:middle line:90%
and so forth?

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.400 align:middle line:84%
When we go into fear,
what happens to our body?

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.750 align:middle line:90%
People don't understand this.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.249 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Right, a
couple of things,

00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:33.470 align:middle line:84%
you're going to produce
stress hormones--

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:37.070 align:middle line:84%
cortisol, epinephrine,
adrenaline.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.340 align:middle line:84%
You can raise the
car off the baby.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Those are powerful,
powerful hormones.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.209 align:middle line:84%
And they're meant
for an acute stress.

00:21:44.209 --> 00:21:46.000 align:middle line:84%
I've got to do this,
right here, right now.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And thank god we have them,
because we can run from a bear

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.330 align:middle line:90%
and survive, right?

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Once we're finished
running from the bear,

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.970 align:middle line:84%
we need to get out of that
sympathetic nervous system,

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:58.290 align:middle line:90%
where we're running in survival.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And we get into the
parasympathetic state.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Parasympathetic is when the body
goes, oh, there are no bears.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.140 align:middle line:90%
There's no fear here.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, good, I can
detox, I can repair,

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:90%
I can repair my genetics.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.150 align:middle line:84%
I can work on that, I can do
anti-aging, I can cleanse,

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and I can heal, because I
can put all of my effort

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.640 align:middle line:90%
into healing, because I'm safe.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.680 align:middle line:84%
But if I am not safe, my
number-one duty of the body

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.370 align:middle line:90%
is to run from that bear.

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:30.170 align:middle line:90%
You can't heal.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:31.544 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So say
you're at this--

00:22:31.544 --> 00:22:34.700 align:middle line:84%
you wake up every morning,
and you remember, oh my god.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:35.630 align:middle line:90%
I have this.

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Right.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
the fear starts,

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and it runs as an underlying
program all day, all night.

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Right, and that's why
the most important times a day

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:46.220 align:middle line:84%
are as soon as you wake up
and before you go to bed.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.310 align:middle line:84%
You need to have a process,
a meditation, a music,

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:52.570 align:middle line:84%
a something that you do
that can allow you to get

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.560 align:middle line:90%
into a parasympathetic state.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And there are books
that have been written.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.650 align:middle line:84%
One is called
"Spontaneous Remission".

00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:59.450 align:middle line:90%
I like that book.

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And I have my patients
read it, because it really

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:04.730 align:middle line:84%
lets the patients
understand that

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.617 align:middle line:84%
these spontaneous remissions
of stage 4 terminal cancer--

00:23:07.617 --> 00:23:09.950 align:middle line:84%
you were supposed to go home,
put your affairs in order,

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
die in two weeks.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.818 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Those people
who survived that,

00:23:13.818 --> 00:23:15.290 align:middle line:90%
what did they have in common?

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:16.730 align:middle line:90%
They had about seven things.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Two were the diet and the
lifestyle and exercise.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.010 align:middle line:84%
The others were all about
what we're talking about.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:25.100 align:middle line:84%
It was having a
program, having a belief

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.290 align:middle line:84%
system, where it didn't matter
anymore if you had cancer.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:84%
It didn't matter if
you are going to die.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.110 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter,
because it's all good.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm in peace.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I have something
that I have connected

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:40.150 align:middle line:84%
to that is far greater than
any of these other things.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: And when you
can connect to that,

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:44.600 align:middle line:90%
all the rest doesn't matter.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.100 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
there's not a time

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.190 align:middle line:84%
to get the car off the
baby and go take care of--

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and a tumor that's pressing
on a vital organ, those

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.940 align:middle line:84%
are appropriate times to
be in stress and in fear.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And actually, stress
in short periods,

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.070 align:middle line:84%
for short amounts of time,
are actually helpful for us.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.200 align:middle line:90%
They actually help our body.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So we think of all
stress as bad--

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.830 align:middle line:90%
not necessarily.

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Research that's
been done on stress

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:84%
shows that a short period
of time, in an acute stress,

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:14.700 align:middle line:90%
those are actually beneficial.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.150 align:middle line:84%
They can help our
body start to heal.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.362 align:middle line:84%
But when we hold onto that
stress for a long period

00:24:19.362 --> 00:24:20.320 align:middle line:90%
of time, all day long--

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, that
low-level anxiety.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Right, all day--

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.797 align:middle line:84%
that is what's detrimental
and doesn't allow our body

00:24:25.797 --> 00:24:27.130 align:middle line:90%
to go into those healing states.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:28.254 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;>REGINA: So does that--

00:24:28.254 --> 00:24:30.530 align:middle line:84%
say you've decided
that, OK, you're

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:31.640 align:middle line:90%
going to change your diet.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.431 align:middle line:84%
You're going to-- let's
say you're going on

00:24:33.431 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:90%
and alkaline-based diet.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.140 align:middle line:84%
We'll just use
that as an example.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.870 align:middle line:84%
What happens if you're
still running fear,

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:44.150 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to
alkalize your body?

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.360 align:middle line:84%
If fear creates an
acidic condition--

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: That's exactly right.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.800 align:middle line:84%
So there is a Dr. Lupien
out of a major university

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.470 align:middle line:84%
that's done more studies
on stress than anybody.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And I laughed when I first
heard her lecture years ago.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:57.840 align:middle line:90%
I was lecturing.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.990 align:middle line:84%
I ran into her
lecture, and she said

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.630 align:middle line:84%
what she finds is that
many times, when somebody's

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:08.330 align:middle line:84%
been given a very detrimental,
or a diagnosis that's

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:84%
life threatening, one of the
most stressful things you can

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.322 align:middle line:84%
do to that person is give them
a self-help book, because now

00:25:14.322 --> 00:25:15.530 align:middle line:90%
it's, what should I be doing?

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:16.572 align:middle line:90%
I should be alkalinizing.

00:25:16.572 --> 00:25:17.530 align:middle line:90%
I should be doing this.

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:18.950 align:middle line:90%
I should be thinking positive.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that, you're
adding more stress.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's kind
of funny, and something

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
keep in mind, that

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:27.594 align:middle line:84%
trying to do all
the right things,

00:25:27.594 --> 00:25:30.010 align:middle line:84%
or trying to listen to this
person about this, this, this,

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:30.810 align:middle line:90%
and this--

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.970 align:middle line:84%
you can get caught on the
internet for days and years.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're contradictory,
and we don't understand.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:37.820 align:middle line:90%
And we don't know all of it.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.420 align:middle line:90%
Again, what makes sense to you?

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.787 align:middle line:90%
Choose a few simple things.

00:25:41.787 --> 00:25:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Are they making you feel better?

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:43.990 align:middle line:90%
Stay with it.

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.050 align:middle line:84%
If they're not or it's
causing more anxiety

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.830 align:middle line:84%
to try to eat a certain
way, or do a certain thing--

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Especially if you're
radically changing habits.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.133 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Exactly,
radically changing,

00:25:53.133 --> 00:25:57.010 align:middle line:84%
unless you believe it, and
you're ready, and you go,

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.360 align:middle line:84%
this is giving me some peace,
and I know that it's going

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.160 align:middle line:90%
to help--

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.120 align:middle line:90%
I believe it.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Now you're in a peaceful
state to make those changes.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:06.100 align:middle line:84%
But if you're in this
state of, oh my gosh.

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I've got to do this, and I
got to do this, and this,

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.690 align:middle line:84%
you just negated a lot
of the good that can

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.380 align:middle line:90%
come from those healthy habits.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK,
so before we go

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.800 align:middle line:84%
into the whole metabolic
theory of cancer,

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:22.360 align:middle line:84%
just wrapping that up, so if
we have the chemicals related

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:84%
to fear going, it's creating an
acidic condition in our blood.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.677 align:middle line:84%
What else is it
doing, by the way of--

00:26:27.677 --> 00:26:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: It's
creating those hormones

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.720 align:middle line:90%
that can be detrimental to us.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.350 align:middle line:90%
It contracts muscles.

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:36.190 align:middle line:84%
It decreases everything that
we don't need right now.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.700 align:middle line:84%
So if I need to run from a bear,
I don't need to digest my food,

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to have a
normal bowel movement,

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to
have libido, I don't

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:middle line:84%
need to have any of
these things that

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.560 align:middle line:90%
are repair and detoxification.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.220 align:middle line:84%
It gets shut off, because
I have to survive.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:84%
So those are all things
that the body needs

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.690 align:middle line:84%
to activate that perfect
pharmacy that I'm

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.750 align:middle line:90%
talking about, which is yours.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Our own pain killers
are 10 to the 9th power

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.940 align:middle line:84%
stronger than morphine, the
strongest painkiller I've got.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Our pharmacy is
beautiful, it's powerful,

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:09.190 align:middle line:84%
it's stronger than
anything that we've got.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So we can't activate
it if we're--

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In fear.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: If we're in fear or
any of those negative emotions.

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and so
on a cellular level,

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.900 align:middle line:84%
this situation will continue
progressing or deteriorating.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: We can't repair.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.440 align:middle line:90%
We're not in repair mode.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, we're
not in repair mode, OK.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: We've got
to run from that bear

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.440 align:middle line:90%
right here, right now.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, OK, all right--

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:32.200 align:middle line:84%
so now let's get on to the
metabolic theory of cancer.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that came up in
the conversation with Travis.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.000 align:middle line:84%
But we were looking
at a kind of overview

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000 align:middle line:84%
of the historical
research on cancer.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to go into
it in more depth now.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: I really
feel like that

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.840 align:middle line:84%
is, in my opinion, and
many researchers now,

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.610 align:middle line:84%
and physicians, is
that we need to start

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:50.390 align:middle line:90%
looking at cancer differently.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not just genetics,
not just these pieces

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:54.256 align:middle line:84%
that we've gone
down the wrong path.

00:27:54.256 --> 00:27:55.630 align:middle line:84%
But metabolically,
and that means

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.796 align:middle line:84%
look at the whole body,
what are all the pieces that

00:27:57.796 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:84%
need to be addressed to either
healthily live with the cancer

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.850 align:middle line:84%
or be able to decrease the
cancer and get it to go away,

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:05.650 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:10.390 align:middle line:84%
So metabolically is, again, how
are we activating the body's

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.160 align:middle line:90%
own repair mechanism?

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:16.720 align:middle line:84%
The big take-home is that the
only fuel that cancer uses

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.660 align:middle line:90%
is glucose.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.460 align:middle line:90%
It's sugar.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:19.540 align:middle line:90%
It can't use protein.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.980 align:middle line:90%
It can't use fats.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Our other healthy cells can.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So if we're starving it, the
cancer cells, from sugar,

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:29.710 align:middle line:84%
the healthy cells
have other fuels.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.780 align:middle line:84%
But if we're starving
it out with sugar,

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:32.970 align:middle line:90%
that is one main thing.

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:36.110 align:middle line:84%
We also know, by Dr.
D'agostino's research now,

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:40.720 align:middle line:84%
hyperbaric oxygen is incredibly
effective with many types

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.560 align:middle line:90%
of cancer.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's another one of those
pathways that we need to hit,

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:45.850 align:middle line:90%
and we need to do.

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:50.110 align:middle line:84%
So the more research we do
with molecules like 3BP--

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:51.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you
discussed with Dr. Ko.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We did, and we'll get
into that some more with you.

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:55.540 align:middle line:10%
>>DONESE: Right, so all
these different things

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:59.230 align:middle line:10%
that are being looked
at and analyzed all

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:04.060 align:middle line:10%
fit within that big picture of
the metabolic theory of cancer,

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.680 align:middle line:10%
which was, how do we starve it?

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.510 align:middle line:84%
How do we stress
the cancer cells

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and not stress the healthy
cells, unlike chemo, right,

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:12.860 align:middle line:90%
which kills everything?

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: That's the best we've
got in traditional medicine

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:16.600 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.270 align:middle line:84%
But they are, too, looking at
peptides and other things that

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:22.600 align:middle line:84%
are more specific, that are more
targeted toward cancer cells,

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.090 align:middle line:84%
and trying to leave the
healthy cells alone.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:27.650 align:middle line:84%
They're all looking
at the same thing.

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:31.836 align:middle line:84%
It's just I don't know that
we're going to find one cure.

00:29:31.836 --> 00:29:34.210 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to hit it from
all these different areas,

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:37.630 align:middle line:84%
and so does Travis
Christofferson, and Dr.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.050 align:middle line:84%
D'agostino, and those
that are looking at--

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.760 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Sigfried,
who has another book

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.930 align:middle line:90%
that people should read.

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which one is that?

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: And that's the
metabolic theory of cancer.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: That he
really was bringing back

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:52.990 align:middle line:84%
to life Dr. Warburg's theory
of, when you look at a PET scan,

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:55.750 align:middle line:84%
patients say, well, why are
they putting glucose in?

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And why is it lighting up in
the areas where I have cancer?

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.430 align:middle line:84%
That's because the cancer
feeds on the glucose.

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's a perfect example
of how powerful that is.

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:06.400 align:middle line:84%
When patients come
and say, I don't

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.350 align:middle line:84%
know if I can do
this ketogenic diet,

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I can cut
out all carbs and sugars,

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:13.330 align:middle line:84%
then I say, what kind of
motivation do you need?

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:15.163 align:middle line:84%
And if we give them the
picture of their PET

00:30:15.163 --> 00:30:17.610 align:middle line:84%
scan, where it's lighting
up in these areas,

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:18.634 align:middle line:90%
and why did it light up?

00:30:18.634 --> 00:30:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Because you were
feeding it sugar.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:22.780 align:middle line:84%
That's a great little
reminder of, OK,

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.892 align:middle line:84%
maybe that sugar is
not so important to me,

00:30:24.892 --> 00:30:25.294 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to feed it.

00:30:25.294 --> 00:30:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that would be.

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:27.035 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Gives them a visual.

00:30:27.035 --> 00:30:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it
gives them a visual.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.070 align:middle line:90%
And can you tell us just--

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.140 align:middle line:84%
give us a little bit
of a historical glimpse

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:37.640 align:middle line:84%
of Warburg's work and any kind
of studies that were done.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Because most people,
until they started

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.530 align:middle line:84%
watching this little
series, have never

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:43.240 align:middle line:84%
heard of the metabolic
theory of cancer.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.950 align:middle line:90%
And why have they not?

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:46.420 align:middle line:84%
He discovered that
a long time ago.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Right, a
long time ago, and it

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.440 align:middle line:84%
got dismissed because
we got into Big Pharma

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and had ways that they thought
were going to be better

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.190 align:middle line:90%
to treat than this.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:56.470 align:middle line:84%
So Warburg's theory
of understanding

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:00.760 align:middle line:84%
the metabolism of a cancer
cell and a healthy cell

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.170 align:middle line:90%
was very important.

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:03.910 align:middle line:90%
He won Nobel Prizes.

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:06.520 align:middle line:84%
It was recognized,
but then dismissed.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So he was recognized
in that sense.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.860 align:middle line:84%
But that theory was
not taken forward,

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.100 align:middle line:84%
to start studying cancer
or studying other things.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.990 align:middle line:84%
It got dismissed, like
many, many things.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:19.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he was
ostracized and ridiculed,

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.510 align:middle line:84%
just like a lot of our great
scientists in their time.

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:23.551 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is so sad.

00:31:23.551 --> 00:31:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: It didn't fit within
the model where we were going.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big Pharma.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: And now
we're saying, OK.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.070 align:middle line:84%
We've done it this way
for this amount of time.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.870 align:middle line:90%
How are we doing?

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:32.870 align:middle line:90%
Not very well at all.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:34.660 align:middle line:90%
So let's look back.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And now we're looking
back at that theory.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And now more research,
like Dr. D'agostino

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.290 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
Southern Florida--

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:44.260 align:middle line:84%
that research of
researching mouse models,

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.660 align:middle line:84%
and now going into
human models, now we're

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.490 align:middle line:90%
going back and saying, OK.

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:49.330 align:middle line:90%
That made sense.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.210 align:middle line:90%
It makes a lot of sense.

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:54.544 align:middle line:84%
And now it's being
quantified with new research

00:31:54.544 --> 00:31:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to do that,
which they didn't really

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:58.707 align:middle line:90%
have back then.

00:31:58.707 --> 00:32:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And can you just
give us a tiny glimpse?

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:04.350 align:middle line:84%
We're going to try to talk
with him at some point.

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Give us a tiny glimpse
of what his research is

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.080 align:middle line:90%
showing with the mice.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And how far are they
into the human studies?

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Right, so the
mouse studies are always

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:15.040 align:middle line:90%
where you first start.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.729 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
looking at tumors.

00:32:17.729 --> 00:32:19.270 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at
hyperbaric oxygen,

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.370 align:middle line:84%
looking at the ketogenic
diet, and ketones--

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.350 align:middle line:84%
actually, ketones
that people can

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:24.989 align:middle line:90%
take to get you into ketosis.

00:32:24.989 --> 00:32:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we're
going to get into that too.

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: So we're
looking at that.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And I want to leave the
details, because I know you're

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:30.818 align:middle line:90%
going to get Dominic on here.

00:32:30.818 --> 00:32:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And he is amazing, to
tell you that story.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:37.750 align:middle line:84%
But what they are seeing is
very, very impressive results,

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:41.330 align:middle line:84%
from a cancer standpoint
and a metabolic standpoint.

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They implant
tumors into mice.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Yes, yes.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.265 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you've got
something pretty aggressive

00:32:46.265 --> 00:32:47.200 align:middle line:90%
going, to begin with.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.158 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: That's right.

00:32:48.158 --> 00:32:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And they know, by history, how
fast that tumor should grow,

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:54.100 align:middle line:84%
when the mouse should be
dead at a certain time point,

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.277 align:middle line:90%
from that particular.

00:32:55.277 --> 00:32:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So when they're doing
these therapies,

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.570 align:middle line:84%
if they extend their life and
they're shrinking the tumors,

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:05.230 align:middle line:84%
those are all worth sitting
up and taking notice to.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And Dominic, actually, is funded
by the Department of Defense.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And he's working with our elite,
from NASA to the Navy SEALs.

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:17.590 align:middle line:90%
That's who funds Dominic.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:middle line:84%
They wanted him to
look at therapies

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.450 align:middle line:84%
that would make our
extreme warriors

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:24.910 align:middle line:90%
faster, better, more healthy.

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:26.330 align:middle line:90%
That's what he was studying.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And when he was looking at
that, he noticed and found, wow.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Cancer cells are dying when
we're doing this, and making

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:37.990 align:middle line:84%
our elite even better,
from an athletic standpoint

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:39.566 align:middle line:90%
and a performance standpoint.

00:33:39.566 --> 00:33:40.482 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fascinating.

00:33:40.482 --> 00:33:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: So it came
out of that research.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Now he's saying,
OK, not only am I

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:46.525 align:middle line:84%
going to help our
Department of Defense--

00:33:46.525 --> 00:33:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And our
super warriors.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Our super warriors,
but also, now we're looking at,

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:54.100 align:middle line:90%
how do we defeat cancer?

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that is all
part of the metabolic theory.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: That's all part
of the metabolic theory,

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.780 align:middle line:84%
because hyperbaric oxygen
is working on the metabolism

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:02.990 align:middle line:90%
in a certain way.

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:07.030 align:middle line:84%
3B-- all these
molecules, oxaloacetate--

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:10.030 align:middle line:84%
there are many now that we're
looking at, and thinking

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:11.889 align:middle line:84%
that you may want to--
in certain cancers,

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:13.570 align:middle line:84%
as time goes and
the research goes,

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:15.909 align:middle line:84%
we'll know which
combinations work best.

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:19.330 align:middle line:84%
But right now, much of it is
still stuck in the mouse model.

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:21.980 align:middle line:84%
We're not able to
do it in humans yet.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:23.946 align:middle line:90%
What's been holding them up?

00:34:23.946 --> 00:34:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Because you have to--

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:27.370 align:middle line:84%
for human studies,
you have to go

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:30.130 align:middle line:84%
through the loops of
making sure that it's safe,

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:32.590 align:middle line:90%
that it's effective, rightly so.

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:36.040 align:middle line:84%
We are, though,
fast-tracking cancer drugs.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:40.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to think that
research, solid research,

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:45.210 align:middle line:84%
that's being done, like Dr.
D'agostino and like Dr. Ko,

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:47.949 align:middle line:84%
that that's real research
that now, maybe we'll get

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:50.654 align:middle line:84%
to the point where we can
fast-track these as well.

00:34:50.654 --> 00:34:53.409 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's talk
about Dr. Ko for a moment,

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:55.889 align:middle line:90%
and the 3BP.

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:58.490 align:middle line:90%
And what's happening with her?

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:00.700 align:middle line:84%
She got a rough shake
out of the whole thing.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Yeah, she went through
a rough-- she defended her own,

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:05.050 align:middle line:90%
and she won.

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:06.674 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain to
the people, again,

00:35:06.674 --> 00:35:09.120 align:middle line:84%
to our audience what she's
done, what she discovered.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.703 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Dr. Ko was
at Johns Hopkins.

00:35:10.703 --> 00:35:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And she and a group of
scientists, within her group,

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:18.370 align:middle line:84%
they discovered a molecule
called 3-Bromopyruvate.

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:21.530 align:middle line:84%
That molecule kind of
acts like a Trojan horse.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:25.420 align:middle line:84%
So when a cancer
cell eats the sugar,

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.010 align:middle line:84%
it needs to open up to
let go of lactic acid.

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:29.670 align:middle line:90%
That's its waste product.

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:33.320 align:middle line:84%
So it recognizes glucose, and
it recognizes lactic acid.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:37.030 align:middle line:84%
When it opens up to let
go of that lactic acid,

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:40.100 align:middle line:84%
3-Bromopyruvate looks
like lactic acid,

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and it can get inside
the cancer cell.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And it kills the
cancer cell, all right?

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:47.510 align:middle line:84%
So it fools it,
like a Trojan horse.

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:50.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the easiest explanation
that they give patients.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Ko has discovered
this molecule.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.625 align:middle line:84%
She's got her own protocol
and her own way of doing it.

00:35:56.625 --> 00:35:58.250 align:middle line:84%
There are other people
starting to look

00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:59.660 align:middle line:90%
at it in different ways.

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.270 align:middle line:84%
But Dr. Ko is the one that
has done the research,

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:05.180 align:middle line:84%
knows the protocol, has
really studied it in the mouse

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.900 align:middle line:90%
studies, and has been--

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.220 align:middle line:84%
she's worked with some
physicians outside

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.730 align:middle line:84%
of the country,
outside of the US, that

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:14.990 align:middle line:84%
are utilizing the
molecule in different ways

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:16.400 align:middle line:90%
with good success.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.320 align:middle line:90%
So that's where she's at.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And those of us that are working
with this metabolic theory

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.404 align:middle line:84%
are trying to support and
help researchers like Dr. Ko.

00:36:26.404 --> 00:36:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We talked
about-- with Travis,

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:31.720 align:middle line:84%
we talked about one example of
a young man who was really--

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.690 align:middle line:90%
I think it was kidney?

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Yes.

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was kidney cancer,
and very, very far gone.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Yes.

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was brought in by
the father at the last moment.

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And it took them almost a
year to find a physician just

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.390 align:middle line:90%
to administer this.

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Right.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.148 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, this is
what I don't understand.

00:36:48.148 --> 00:36:51.110 align:middle line:84%
What kind of fear is going on
in them, that it took a year?

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:54.074 align:middle line:84%
The kid was just a breath
away from dying by then.

00:36:54.074 --> 00:36:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Right
right, so if we're

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:59.210 align:middle line:84%
talking about what's going on
within the medical industry,

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:02.730 align:middle line:84%
the 3-Bromopyruvate has
not gone through the steps

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:07.040 align:middle line:84%
that it needs to, to be able
to be utilized on a human.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.160 align:middle line:84%
There are some physicians
in the United States--

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.380 align:middle line:84%
at risk, probably, to
their medical license--

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:16.700 align:middle line:84%
that are willing to administer
the 3-Bromopyruvate.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.660 align:middle line:90%
So that's what's going on.

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And without naming those
physicians-- that's up to them,

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:25.490 align:middle line:84%
if they want to be out there
and naming what they're doing--

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:26.920 align:middle line:90%
it's at risk.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.604 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What kind of
results are they having?

00:37:29.604 --> 00:37:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Different results
for different types of cancer.

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:33.720 align:middle line:84%
If they're following
Ko's protocol,

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.420 align:middle line:84%
they're getting
some good effect.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.800 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.590 align:middle line:84%
If they're not following
through the protocol,

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:42.650 align:middle line:90%
I consider that as even riskier.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
it's a good idea.

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, OK,
because as you said,

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.490 align:middle line:90%
there are compliments to it.

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And it can be extraordinarily
effective if--

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: And it's so effective
that it kills the tumor

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:55.330 align:middle line:90%
so fast--

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:57.130 align:middle line:90%
it's a tumor lysis syndrome--

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.120 align:middle line:84%
that that's what
becomes toxic and can

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:02.390 align:middle line:84%
kill the patient, because it's
an overload of this tumor being

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:03.630 align:middle line:90%
killed so fast.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:05.840 align:middle line:84%
That's why you need
to do, and look

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.670 align:middle line:84%
at the entire, whole
picture, and be

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:12.902 align:middle line:84%
able to help the patient survive
that tumor dying so quickly.

00:38:12.902 --> 00:38:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and that's what
happened with this young man.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Yes.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He went into
a coma, and no one

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:19.440 align:middle line:90%
knew what was going on.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.830 align:middle line:84%
They thought the drug was
killing him, when in fact, he

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:24.795 align:middle line:84%
was young enough that his being
came back, and kicked back

00:38:24.795 --> 00:38:25.595 align:middle line:90%
into gear.

00:38:25.595 --> 00:38:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm alive, I'm going
on the lecture circuit.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was totally amazing,
although it had already

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:32.345 align:middle line:90%
destroyed so much of the kidney.

00:38:32.345 --> 00:38:33.145 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Yes, yes.

00:38:33.145 --> 00:38:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But are there
protocols that are now--

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:39.470 align:middle line:84%
have been created,
or are in place,

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:41.810 align:middle line:84%
to deal with the toxic
die-off of those cells, that

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:43.534 align:middle line:90%
make this all go very smoothly?

00:38:43.534 --> 00:38:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: They are
in development, would

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.800 align:middle line:90%
be the way to say it, right?

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.120 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I know you
can't say certain things,

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:49.805 align:middle line:84%
because it's all
being developed.

00:38:49.805 --> 00:38:50.605 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:38:50.605 --> 00:38:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Right, yeah,
that's the issue.

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:54.600 align:middle line:90%
So they are in development.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.230 align:middle line:84%
We know certain things that
can help in that instance.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:39:01.550 align:middle line:84%
But when we're looking at--
in traditional world-- rightly

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:03.800 align:middle line:84%
or wrongly, and all
the good and the bad

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.200 align:middle line:84%
on both sides of
medicine, one thing

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.390 align:middle line:84%
is making sure that it
is safe and efficacious.

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And those steps are there
to try to protect us.

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Those steps are also
there, maybe, to protect

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:18.350 align:middle line:84%
other interests as well, and to
keep other types of therapies

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:20.930 align:middle line:84%
a little slower, because it
would be in great conflict.

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:24.660 align:middle line:84%
If we can work on cancer
in a natural way or--

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, 3-Bromopyruvate
is not a natural molecule.

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a chemical.

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm, right.

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:30.751 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: So it's not natural.

00:39:30.751 --> 00:39:32.750 align:middle line:84%
It depends on how we're
describing these things.

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:33.550 align:middle line:90%
But if--

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does it have
something to do with B6?

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: No, no.

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:37.171 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not at all, OK.

00:39:37.171 --> 00:39:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Well, long story.

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Long
story, never mind.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.145 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: But yeah, we don't
want to get into biochemistry.

00:39:41.145 --> 00:39:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we
don't need to, yeah.

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: But not really,
it is a synthetic molecule.

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: OK?

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And so when we, on
both sides, are really

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.030 align:middle line:84%
trying to find, what's the
most efficacious and the safest

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.950 align:middle line:90%
that we can get?

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:55.355 align:middle line:90%
There are trial periods in that.

00:39:55.355 --> 00:39:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And that means we're trying
to do it on mice first.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.629 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: But at some
point, like you say,

00:40:00.629 --> 00:40:02.780 align:middle line:84%
if we've got an
end-stage terminal cancer

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:05.550 align:middle line:84%
patient that traditional
medicine has gone, go home.

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:06.350 align:middle line:90%
We can't--

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why can't-- yeah.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.476 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: That's a catch that
we'd like to be able to see.

00:40:09.476 --> 00:40:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Can we open up the
doors a little bit,

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:15.110 align:middle line:84%
if they are well aware and
they're well understanding

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:17.720 align:middle line:84%
what the risks are, and that
we don't know a lot about some

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.910 align:middle line:90%
of these things.

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Are they willing
to take that risk?

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:22.190 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think most people
watching this would say,

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:25.220 align:middle line:90%
heck yeah.

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.815 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Until they're in
those shoes, and their families.

00:40:27.815 --> 00:40:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: And then the
risk of the physician--

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:31.046 align:middle line:84%
even though the
patient says, yes.

00:40:31.046 --> 00:40:32.330 align:middle line:90%
I want to do it.

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:35.390 align:middle line:84%
They pass away, then you've got
the risk of the family coming

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:37.790 align:middle line:84%
after the physician,
after the fact, saying,

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:40.040 align:middle line:84%
you should have told them
to do traditional medicine.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And they died, and
you killed them.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: So there's a
lot of risk involved here.

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So science has always
been in this quandary

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:54.110 align:middle line:84%
of being able to push forward
at the risk of and the ability

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:57.290 align:middle line:84%
of certain brave patients
and brave physicians

00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:00.197 align:middle line:84%
that are willing to step outside
of the box and look at it.

00:41:00.197 --> 00:41:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But this is happening.

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: It is happening.

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:06.050 align:middle line:84%
We'll see how it goes, and
some of the brave physicians

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:07.480 align:middle line:90%
that are utilizing this.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:12.360 align:middle line:84%
At any time, there
could be an issue

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.800 align:middle line:90%
with them administering this.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:19.582 align:middle line:84%
So they have decided that
it's worth the risk for them.

00:41:19.582 --> 00:41:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, right,
and it is very helpful.

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: And they have an IRB.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.460 align:middle line:84%
One physician, in
particular that's doing it,

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:27.530 align:middle line:84%
he has an IRB, which is
institutional review board.

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:29.210 align:middle line:84%
That gives him some
kind of protection,

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:32.450 align:middle line:84%
to be able to look at this
and these off-label uses or--

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:35.610 align:middle line:84%
in this case, this is
the only label use--

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:36.530 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do it.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:38.780 align:middle line:84%
So they're protecting
themselves as much as they can.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and are they
using the new potential

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:46.686 align:middle line:84%
detoxification
elements with it yet?

00:41:46.686 --> 00:41:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: That, I don't
know the particulars of.

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All right,
so that's down the--

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: I don't want to speak
for those physicians, yeah.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.409 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, but we know
that it's under development.

00:41:54.409 --> 00:41:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: It is, it is.

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now, about
the ketogenic diet--

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.440 align:middle line:84%
so we're talking about
the metabolic theory

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.020 align:middle line:84%
of cancer, which leads
us to a ketogenic diet.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:06.770 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are on
paleo, which is sometimes

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:08.810 align:middle line:84%
like a softer version
of a ketogenic diet,

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:12.870 align:middle line:84%
because it allows for some
carbohydrates, certain types.

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the ketogenic diet.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.480 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned it earlier that,
to starve the cancer cell

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.250 align:middle line:84%
glucose-- what does
that actually mean?

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.090 align:middle line:90%
What's required?

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Right, so
the ketogenic diet

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:25.546 align:middle line:84%
was developed, originally,
for children with epilepsy.

00:42:25.546 --> 00:42:27.920 align:middle line:84%
When they had epileptic seizures
and nothing was working,

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.009 align:middle line:84%
they knew when they put
them on this type of diet

00:42:30.009 --> 00:42:31.050 align:middle line:90%
they could get past that.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Now, we're also knowing--

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.490 align:middle line:84%
and I know this to be
true in my clinic--

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:36.780 align:middle line:84%
from any neurological
disorder, any--

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.079 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Because
sugar's a bad guy!

00:42:39.079 --> 00:42:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The glucose--
yeah, sugar's a bad guy.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.640 align:middle line:84%
But talk to us about
that a little bit,

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.870 align:middle line:90%
in terms of epilepsy.

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Brain cells, too,
are metabolically very active.

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:49.490 align:middle line:90%
And so they want a lot of sugar.

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:50.750 align:middle line:90%
They use a lot of sugar.

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:53.870 align:middle line:84%
So it all goes back to
this metabolism thing,

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:58.370 align:middle line:84%
which has to do, in essence,
of just how fast we process

00:42:58.370 --> 00:42:59.700 align:middle line:90%
things, how we process it.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So the metabolism
of anything is how

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:06.410 align:middle line:84%
the body's trying to figure
out how to work with it.

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:09.530 align:middle line:84%
So when we give high fat,
like in the ketogenic diet,

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:10.760 align:middle line:90%
the brain is mostly fat.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And it loves fat,
so it's very healing

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.270 align:middle line:84%
to give fat to the
brain, also healing

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:18.950 align:middle line:84%
to give fat to the
body, whenever we're

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:21.303 align:middle line:90%
trying to protect, in cancer.

00:43:21.303 --> 00:43:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: So all of
these same conditions--

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:28.370 align:middle line:84%
and in those elite athletes,
they need high fat,

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and they need some
protein, metabolically,

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:32.900 align:middle line:84%
to have their muscles
be strong and healthy.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So if we're doing higher
fat and some protein,

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.350 align:middle line:84%
to be able to keep those
muscles in all patients--

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:42.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if we're talking
cancer, neurological diseases,

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.705 align:middle line:90%
or extreme athletes.

00:43:43.705 --> 00:43:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or extreme
athletes, yeah.

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Doesn't matter, we
need protein for those muscles.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.460 align:middle line:84%
We need a few
complex carbs, just

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.230 align:middle line:90%
for some quick, little energy.

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:52.970 align:middle line:84%
So that is in the
ketogenic diet.

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:55.760 align:middle line:84%
But the big difference between
ketogenic diet and the rest

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.500 align:middle line:90%
is it's more fat.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.490 align:middle line:90%
We are feeding the brain.

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:01.550 align:middle line:84%
We're feeding--
whenever the body's

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:05.510 align:middle line:84%
in stress, a little
more ability to use fat,

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:10.144 align:middle line:84%
because once the body's
out of sugar, and it says,

00:44:10.144 --> 00:44:11.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any fuel.

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:12.200 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to use?

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Then it's going to turn,
in different stages,

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:15.680 align:middle line:90%
to different types of fuel.

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.380 align:middle line:90%
But eventually, it gets to fat.

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And so if you want
to lose weight,

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:21.900 align:middle line:84%
we want to lose fat, then
stop eating sugar and carbs.

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, eat more fat.

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:24.816 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: And why is
it that that works?

00:44:24.816 --> 00:44:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Right, why is it
that that works,

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:30.470 align:middle line:84%
is that you're now burning
fat instead of sugar, right?

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:33.507 align:middle line:84%
And so by eating fat,
you're not gaining weight.

00:44:33.507 --> 00:44:35.756 align:middle line:84%
That whole low-fat diet thing
was a miserable failure.

00:44:35.756 --> 00:44:35.810 align:middle line:90%
People gained weight.

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, god,
and the saying

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:38.010 align:middle line:90%
used to be fat begets fat.

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Right.

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Not true.

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sugar begets fat.

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: And there are
different types of fat.

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And your audience is
well aware of what

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.140 align:middle line:90%
are good fats and bad fats.

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:48.590 align:middle line:84%
But by eating fat, it
actually helps the metabolism

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:53.040 align:middle line:84%
to decrease the amount of excess
fat that we have on our bodies.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
the ketogenic diet

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:58.160 align:middle line:84%
is basically fat, protein,
then finally some complex

00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.859 align:middle line:84%
carbohydrates, but
in a small amount.

00:44:59.859 --> 00:45:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: That's
right, that's right.

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:02.654 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, go ahead.

00:45:02.654 --> 00:45:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: So difficult for
most people to do, right?

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to ask.

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: My patients that
are current oncology patients,

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:08.690 align:middle line:90%
they have cancer.

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:09.560 align:middle line:90%
They're on it.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:10.976 align:middle line:84%
They're doing their
ketone strips.

00:45:10.976 --> 00:45:13.010 align:middle line:84%
They're making sure
they're in ketosis.

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:16.200 align:middle line:84%
They're doing the
Bulletproof-type coffees with

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.000 align:middle line:90%
the--

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.244 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, Dave
Asprey, interviewed him.

00:45:19.244 --> 00:45:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Right,
right, so they're

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.480 align:middle line:84%
doing all these things to
give themselves some comfort

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.360 align:middle line:90%
food, right?

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.160 align:middle line:90%
They're on it.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.880 align:middle line:90%
They like it, they feel good.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.880 align:middle line:84%
They actually have energy,
they're feeling good.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.220 align:middle line:84%
If they had lost weight
from the cachexia of cancer,

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.260 align:middle line:84%
they're gaining that
good muscle weight back.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:33.800 align:middle line:90%
They look good.

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:34.640 align:middle line:90%
They feel good.

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.040 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any problems
staying on this, all right?

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.498 align:middle line:84%
The patients that
just say, well, I

00:45:38.498 --> 00:45:40.640 align:middle line:84%
don't want to get
cancer, or I want

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:44.870 align:middle line:84%
to do-- it's a little more
difficult to do the diet.

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:47.900 align:middle line:84%
In that case, that's where
ketones have been developed.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Those are in a protein
drink that you're actually--

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:54.650 align:middle line:84%
instead of asking your body to
make those ketones, by being

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:57.410 align:middle line:84%
in the ketogenic diet, you're
actually drinking the ketone

00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:58.790 align:middle line:90%
to get into ketosis.

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So you can cheat a
little bit on the diet.

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:03.454 align:middle line:84%
So we're finding ways to allow
you to cheat a little bit

00:46:03.454 --> 00:46:04.370 align:middle line:90%
on the ketogenic diet.

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is this working?

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:05.836 align:middle line:90%
I mean is--

00:46:05.836 --> 00:46:06.252 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Yeah.

00:46:06.252 --> 00:46:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:08.228 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: People
are losing weight.

00:46:08.228 --> 00:46:09.770 align:middle line:90%
They feel good energy.

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:14.510 align:middle line:84%
By the way, the ketones, a
couple of companies that I know

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:16.490 align:middle line:84%
that have the right
kind of ketones,

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:19.950 align:middle line:84%
and they actually are
Dominic D'agostino's--

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:22.730 align:middle line:84%
his ketones that have
the science behind it.

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:26.960 align:middle line:84%
The companies that are utilizing
the correct ketone salts

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.315 align:middle line:84%
are having good effect, and
I have my patients on this,

00:46:30.315 --> 00:46:31.440 align:middle line:90%
and I know that clinically.

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, you do?

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:32.390 align:middle line:90%
So it's on the market.

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Yes.

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is-- people are,
by now, saying, what is this?

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:36.580 align:middle line:90%
What is this product?

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: I know, right right.

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.821 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are a
couple of companies

00:46:38.821 --> 00:46:41.990 align:middle line:84%
that I know that are utilizing
what I would consider the best

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:43.130 align:middle line:90%
kind of ketone salts.

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:46.570 align:middle line:84%
One is Kegenix, and
the other one is--

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:50.540 align:middle line:84%
it is a multi-level group,
but it's ForeverGreen.

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And those are the companies,
that I personally know of,

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:57.140 align:middle line:84%
that are utilizing the
right kind of ketone salts

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.930 align:middle line:90%
and good-quality products.

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Dominic's always in the
middle of developing

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:03.160 align:middle line:90%
new things, all the time.

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So we try to stay with
what he's got going on,

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:09.660 align:middle line:84%
and be able to keep up with
him, as the research that he's

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.460 align:middle line:90%
doing.

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:15.950 align:middle line:84%
But those are products
that are helping.

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before we go
to this next question,

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:19.700 align:middle line:84%
maybe we should have
given a little primer,

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.980 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what ketones
are, their function.

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: OK, so when your
body goes into ketosis,

00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:27.250 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
have the sugar

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and it needs to start burning
fat, it makes ketones.

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:33.910 align:middle line:84%
These are molecules that
our own body produces.

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's those ketones
that start burning the fat

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and get us out of this
metabolic problem that we have.

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So ketones are something
that we produce.

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now this
is something-- because

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:51.890 align:middle line:84%
of the belief systems we all
hold about certain diets,

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:56.150 align:middle line:84%
we need to look at the notion of
vegetarians and ketones, vegans

00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:57.260 align:middle line:90%
and ketones.

00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:59.820 align:middle line:84%
How do-- because a lot
of the ketogenic diet

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:03.920 align:middle line:84%
does have to do with animal
fats and proteins, right?

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Right, so there
are different-- there

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:09.130 align:middle line:84%
are vegan sources of fats,
and there are vegan proteins.

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Pea protein, cranberry
protein, those

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:13.460 align:middle line:84%
are great sources of protein
to be able to get it.

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:17.120 align:middle line:84%
It is more difficult for
vegans to be able to go into,

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:20.660 align:middle line:84%
to finding the amount of
fats, but not impossible.

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Raw nuts and seeds--
all the things

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.830 align:middle line:84%
that they already know about,
we just need more of it.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So online, there's a
wealth of information

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:29.510 align:middle line:84%
out there on the
ketogenic diet and how

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:32.720 align:middle line:84%
vegans can play into
that and be able to get

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:33.810 align:middle line:90%
the right amount of fats.

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and I would
think that the ketone products

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:39.990 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about
earlier would benefit--

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.823 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: They help.

00:48:40.823 --> 00:48:43.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Particularly
a vegan, in trying

00:48:43.065 --> 00:48:44.315 align:middle line:90%
to go into a state of ketosis.

00:48:44.315 --> 00:48:45.273 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: That's right.

00:48:45.273 --> 00:48:46.300 align:middle line:90%
It helps.

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.690 align:middle line:90%
It helps, it does.

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, we've
touched on the fact

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:53.990 align:middle line:84%
that the vegans and
vegetarians can make this work.

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, what about cancer therapy
such as the Gerson Clinic,

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.810 align:middle line:84%
where you're doing a lot of
fresh enzymes, raw juicing.

00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:05.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of sugar
in that, and some people

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:06.264 align:middle line:90%
respond really well to it.

00:49:06.264 --> 00:49:07.221 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: That's right.

00:49:07.221 --> 00:49:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about that.

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:11.611 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Yes, so I think that
patients just have to choose.

00:49:11.611 --> 00:49:12.610 align:middle line:90%
They have to look at it.

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:14.193 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
the Gerson therapy--

00:49:14.193 --> 00:49:16.910 align:middle line:84%
anytime anybody makes a
radical change in their diet--

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:18.740 align:middle line:84%
remember, that was one
of the seven things

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:20.300 align:middle line:84%
that helped
spontaneous remission.

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:23.690 align:middle line:84%
You cleaned up your diet,
even if it has the sugars,

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:26.325 align:middle line:84%
even if it has the juicing
and all that, if you clean up

00:49:26.325 --> 00:49:28.700 align:middle line:84%
your diet, it's going to give
the body a fighting chance,

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:29.150 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: So I think-- but the
more that we discover about

00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:36.600 align:middle line:84%
the metabolic theory and
how cancer feeds on sugar--

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and there are different
types of sugar.

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:40.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm leaning more
towards, let's stay away

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:43.850 align:middle line:84%
from the sugar, even the
natural fructose sugars.

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:48.205 align:middle line:84%
You can juice vegetables,
without fruit in it,

00:49:48.205 --> 00:49:49.080 align:middle line:90%
without the fructose.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So there's a way
to do the juicing.

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:52.529 align:middle line:84%
There's a way to kind
of combine the both,

00:49:52.529 --> 00:49:54.320 align:middle line:84%
but it's the sugar
we've got to be careful.

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, but stay
away from the high--

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:58.142 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of--
at the Gerson Clinic,

00:49:58.142 --> 00:49:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not just
singling them out.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.710 align:middle line:84%
They've done some really good
work, and a lot of others.

00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Yes, they
have, absolutely.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.099 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of it,
however, is high in carrots,

00:50:05.099 --> 00:50:07.390 align:middle line:84%
for example, and apples, and
some of the higher sugars.

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:09.098 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: And beta
carotene has its place

00:50:09.098 --> 00:50:11.545 align:middle line:84%
in trying to work
with some cancers.

00:50:11.545 --> 00:50:14.152 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it has a flood
of those fresh enzymes, right?

00:50:14.152 --> 00:50:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: That's right.

00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And I lecture a lot on
enzymes, and enzyme therapies,

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:20.360 align:middle line:90%
and what that does for us.

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Enzymes are amazing.

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And enzymes, in their own
right, can fight cancer.

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
positives coming out

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:28.690 align:middle line:84%
of any time you've got a
clean, good diet that's

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:32.320 align:middle line:84%
healthy, and again, just
helping that body utilize what

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.645 align:middle line:90%
it needs to fight that cancer.

00:50:34.645 --> 00:50:38.050 align:middle line:84%
We'll know more in time, as
more and more studies come in.

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:42.130 align:middle line:84%
But right now, when cancer
patients come to me,

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:44.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm leaning more toward
the ketogenic diet.

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now going
back to enzymes then,

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:49.650 align:middle line:84%
for just a moment, and
talking about prevention--

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Yes.

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you a big fan
of digestive versus systemic?

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:56.290 align:middle line:84%
We talked at the very
top about systemic a bit.

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:58.284 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Right,
so I'm about, what

00:50:58.284 --> 00:50:59.700 align:middle line:84%
does that individual
patient need?

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:02.110 align:middle line:84%
If they've got good digestion,
they're eating healthy,

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I say, save the
digestive enzymes

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:06.850 align:middle line:84%
for when you're eating something
that you don't normally eat.

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And any time you're
eating a live plant,

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:10.930 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't need more aid.

00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:12.990 align:middle line:84%
It already has its
own enzymes going.

00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you're eating
a cooked meal,

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:17.080 align:middle line:84%
that's the time to do
a digestive enzyme,

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:19.180 align:middle line:84%
if you want to get the
nutrients out of your food

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:20.740 align:middle line:90%
and help you break it down.

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:24.490 align:middle line:84%
If you have systemic issues--
fibroids, scar tissue,

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:27.280 align:middle line:84%
inflammation-- now
that's the place of where

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.350 align:middle line:90%
systemic enzymes are coming in.

00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a
two-hour presentation

00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:35.830 align:middle line:84%
on the science behind systemic
enzymes, bromelain and papain,

00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:40.690 align:middle line:84%
with cancer, with many
conditions, medical conditions,

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:44.040 align:middle line:84%
that are reacting in a positive
way to systemic enzymes.

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:46.270 align:middle line:84%
So I think they're
underutilized in medicine

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:47.604 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of conditions.

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's
what I understand.

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Again, because our viewers are
going to be curious about this,

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:57.160 align:middle line:84%
would you suggest
that, say, over 40 or--

00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:00.140 align:middle line:84%
I know these are based on
one-size-fits-all suggestions--

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:02.830 align:middle line:84%
but that it's a good idea
for people to take systemic

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:03.670 align:middle line:90%
enzymes?

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: If someone has
inflammation, they're hurting.

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Inflammation, pain.

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Or C-reactive
protein is high, that we know,

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:13.330 align:middle line:84%
or a family history, it's just
a good idea-- three before bed

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:14.650 align:middle line:90%
at night, if nothing else.

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as aspirin
when you're hurting,

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:19.070 align:middle line:84%
you're sluggish, your
blood is thick and sticky,

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:20.620 align:middle line:90%
you're not feeling well.

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Enzymes are a great way
to think about, oh, I

00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:24.230 align:middle line:90%
don't want to do an aspirin.

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:25.330 align:middle line:90%
I want to do something.

00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Think about an enzyme instead.

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they go through
and munch up necrotic tissue,

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:29.756 align:middle line:90%
and the like, inside--

00:52:29.756 --> 00:52:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: They work on fibroids
and all kinds of scar tissue.

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:36.390 align:middle line:84%
They're just amazing
little molecules.

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's OK to mention--

00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:39.670 align:middle line:84%
do you have a few
companies that you

00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:41.736 align:middle line:84%
find are doing really good
product that you like?

00:52:41.736 --> 00:52:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: I really,
honestly do believe

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.470 align:middle line:84%
that there are a lot of good
systemic enzyme companies

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.880 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: But what I encourage
all of my patients and people

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:52.840 align:middle line:84%
that I talk to is, ask for
a certificate of analysis

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.850 align:middle line:84%
of any company that
you're working with.

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:57.850 align:middle line:84%
That's called a C of A.
That means that company's

00:52:57.850 --> 00:52:58.749 align:middle line:90%
doing the testing.

00:52:58.749 --> 00:53:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And if they say, no, we're
not doing the testing.

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:01.730 align:middle line:90%
It's proprietary.

00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:03.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not proprietary
to show me you

00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:06.430 align:middle line:84%
did testing on the ingredients
that are listed on your label.

00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:08.350 align:middle line:84%
That is not, so
that's a cop-out.

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:10.000 align:middle line:90%
And if they say, it's expensive.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:10.840 align:middle line:90%
We can't do it.

00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:12.010 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:14.800 align:middle line:90%
So first step is quality.

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Ask any company for any
product that you're doing.

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I want a certificate
of analysis.

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And as a physician, when
I use it as my medicine,

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:24.340 align:middle line:84%
I ask for more steps,
even, than that.

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:26.050 align:middle line:84%
I want in-batch
runs, and I want them

00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:29.440 align:middle line:84%
to show me to the n-th degree
that they're doing the testing.

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And they also name me
insured, as a physician.

00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:35.800 align:middle line:84%
That way, if somebody has a
problem with a supplement,

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.146 align:middle line:84%
that company backs up
what they're doing.

00:53:38.146 --> 00:53:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And if I had a
company that says,

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:41.440 align:middle line:84%
no, I'm not going to
help you with that.

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.480 align:middle line:84%
You're on your own if
somebody-- that's not

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.760 align:middle line:90%
companies I do business with.

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: And I've got
about 60 companies.

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:48.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not about a company.

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.210 align:middle line:90%
It's about the product.

00:53:49.210 --> 00:53:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The product, right.

00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: So I'm loyal to the
quality of the product, not

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:52.230 align:middle line:90%
a company.

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and
so systemic enzymes

00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:56.870 align:middle line:84%
are sometimes part of your
cancer protocols as well.

00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: They are.

00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:58.750 align:middle line:90%
They definitely are.

00:53:58.750 --> 00:53:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good, all right.

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:00.290 align:middle line:90%
That's good to know.

00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for that advice,
the three at night before bed.

00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Sure.

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you're
talking, all of this

00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:08.290 align:middle line:84%
really leads to the
subject of longevity.

00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Yes.

00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we'll move
aside from the cancer story.

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:16.480 align:middle line:84%
These same protocols
that you're talking about

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:19.630 align:middle line:84%
have to do with our general
well-being and longevity.

00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:21.640 align:middle line:84%
It's the same story,
anti-cancer and longevity.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: That's exactly, it's
exactly the same treatment,

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:24.880 align:middle line:90%
exactly the same story.

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So talk
to us about that.

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: It is.

00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So calorie restriction,
we know, helps longevity.

00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.910 align:middle line:10%
We know these things.

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:33.000 align:middle line:10%
We've got enough science
to understand these.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.430 align:middle line:10%
So if we're looking at ketogenic
diet, or at least calorie

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:40.255 align:middle line:10%
restriction a few times a week,
or fasting every so often--

00:54:40.255 --> 00:54:41.755 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That
intermittent fasting.

00:54:41.755 --> 00:54:42.963 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: It's the same idea.

00:54:42.963 --> 00:54:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Intermittent or you
say, once a month, I'm

00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:47.500 align:middle line:84%
going to go on a two-
or three-day water fast.

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.630 align:middle line:84%
It's an immediate
stress to the body,

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:52.225 align:middle line:84%
for it to cleanse and to do
the things that it needs to do.

00:54:52.225 --> 00:54:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, right.

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: So it's a jump-start.

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:54.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a wake up.

00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So you can do one, or
all, or a combination.

00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:59.320 align:middle line:84%
All of these things have
enough science now for us

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.810 align:middle line:84%
to get excited and say,
we do know some things

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:03.280 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
extend our life,

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and not just extend our life,
but give us a quality of life.

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:07.690 align:middle line:90%
It's, how are we feeling?

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:10.720 align:middle line:84%
We're keeping people alive
longer today than we have.

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:11.950 align:middle line:90%
But in what condition?

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to be in a hospital
bed, hooked up to tubes?

00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:17.920 align:middle line:90%
That's not a quality of life.

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So the quality of
life is working

00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:23.320 align:middle line:84%
on the epigenetic pieces, the
mind, the body, the physical,

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.150 align:middle line:90%
the spirit, all of it.

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:26.640 align:middle line:90%
And that's the exciting part.

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:27.900 align:middle line:90%
We're getting better.

00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:31.174 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK, and also,
the morning fasting thing--

00:55:31.174 --> 00:55:32.840 align:middle line:84%
let's just talk about
that for a moment,

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.430 align:middle line:84%
because I know a lot of
people have gone that way,

00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:36.780 align:middle line:84%
didn't really eat until a
little later in the morning.

00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:38.950 align:middle line:84%
What, 15 hours of fasting,
stop eating around 6:00

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:39.750 align:middle line:90%
in the evening?

00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Right, that
general protocol,

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.420 align:middle line:90%
don't eat past 7:00 PM at night.

00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:43.517 align:middle line:90%
Don't eat till noon.

00:55:43.517 --> 00:55:45.350 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have a
blood-sugar issue that's

00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:47.150 align:middle line:84%
causing you problems,
that's a great way to do it.

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:47.950 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:49.402 align:middle line:90%
That's easy, inexpensive.

00:55:49.402 --> 00:55:51.860 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea that we have to
eat breakfast to be healthy,

00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:53.287 align:middle line:84%
that's going out
the door as well.

00:55:53.287 --> 00:55:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, that's what
I was going to ask next.

00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:56.703 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Right, but it depends.

00:55:56.703 --> 00:55:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Some people with
blood-sugar problems

00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:01.280 align:middle line:84%
that aren't able to stabilize,
they need to eat more often,

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.460 align:middle line:90%
small amounts.

00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:03.830 align:middle line:90%
So it's individual.

00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:05.180 align:middle line:90%
That may work for one person.

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:06.910 align:middle line:90%
And the next person says, OK.

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And I had my patients doing
this protocol-- two days

00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:11.527 align:middle line:90%
a week, calorie restriction.

00:56:11.527 --> 00:56:12.860 align:middle line:90%
You choose the days of the week.

00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:13.930 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
be back to back.

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:14.700 align:middle line:90%
You look at your--

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's caloric
restriction mean?

00:56:16.450 --> 00:56:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: 500 calories for women
and 600 for men, in a day--

00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:21.614 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if
you snack all day.

00:56:21.614 --> 00:56:23.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if you wait
and eat it all in one meal.

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:26.180 align:middle line:84%
If you do that two
days a week, I've

00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:29.360 align:middle line:84%
followed enough patients to
know how well they were doing.

00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:30.821 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
way of doing it.

00:56:30.821 --> 00:56:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it stresses
the body again, right?

00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Again, a
little bit of a stress,

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:36.440 align:middle line:84%
because if you're not putting
sugar in, what's it burning?

00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:36.760 align:middle line:90%
Fat.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fat.

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:38.746 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: So they're
losing some weight.

00:56:38.746 --> 00:56:39.686 align:middle line:90%
They're feeling good.

00:56:39.686 --> 00:56:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
day, you're not

00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:43.310 align:middle line:84%
willing to come in
and just eat too much.

00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Your stomach has shrunk up,
so you're still in this,

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:47.990 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm not going to
mess up what I just did.

00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: And you stay in
more of a healthy lifestyle.

00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:53.350 align:middle line:84%
It just kind of keeps
your brain locked in it.

00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:54.150 align:middle line:90%
That's another way.

00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And the other way is taking
a little mini-vacation,

00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:58.460 align:middle line:90%
going somewhere.

00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Go up in the beautiful
mountains, here in Boulder.

00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Go to the ocean and say,
I'm on a water fast.

00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
spiritually, emotionally,

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:07.910 align:middle line:90%
and physically fast my body.

00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:09.611 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
beautiful thing to do.

00:57:09.611 --> 00:57:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And that-- again, when
you're out of that,

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:13.670 align:middle line:84%
you're not ready to jump
right back into Oreos, right?

00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, right,
exactly, because at first it's

00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.282 align:middle line:84%
a big energetic
and mental downer.

00:57:19.282 --> 00:57:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Right, right.

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And finally,
one thing on wrapping up

00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:25.460 align:middle line:84%
this part of our conversation,
regarding cancer,

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:28.190 align:middle line:84%
is that there are many,
many types of cancer

00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:29.422 align:middle line:90%
that a body can live with.

00:57:29.422 --> 00:57:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: That's right.

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:30.950 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:32.783 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
the part of the story--

00:57:32.783 --> 00:57:34.340 align:middle line:84%
that's why I'm
afraid of doctors.

00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:36.860 align:middle line:84%
You go in, and,
first of all, all the

00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:39.110 align:middle line:84%
diagnostics they have--
oh, there's something here.

00:57:39.110 --> 00:57:40.260 align:middle line:90%
There's something there.

00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:41.676 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the truth of what

00:57:41.676 --> 00:57:44.505 align:middle line:84%
happens, what the body
can do and can live with,

00:57:44.505 --> 00:57:46.880 align:middle line:84%
especially once you have these
tools we just spoke about.

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: That's right.

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And that goes back,
again, to the individual,

00:57:48.830 --> 00:57:49.750 align:middle line:90%
even with genetics.

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:51.770 align:middle line:84%
I tell the person,
do you really want

00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:54.740 align:middle line:84%
to know that you've got a
70% chance of breast cancer?

00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Is that going to change your
mindset and your lifestyle,

00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:59.636 align:middle line:84%
or are you going to
live in fear with that?

00:57:59.636 --> 00:58:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And if they go,
I'm a worry wart.

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:01.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to stress.

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:02.840 align:middle line:90%
That's going to stress me out.

00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Then I say, OK,
let's not know then.

00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:06.826 align:middle line:84%
Let's not know, and
let's do everything

00:58:06.826 --> 00:58:09.200 align:middle line:84%
that you want to do to be a
healthy, wonderful lifestyle,

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:09.250 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There you
go, good advice.

00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: If you go, no.

00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:14.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm stressed out not
knowing, and I want to know.

00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's going
to empower me to do

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:19.430 align:middle line:84%
something different in my life,
now let's run the genetics.

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's the big take-home, is
it's not what type of cancer,

00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:26.840 align:middle line:90%
can we live with it, we cannot.

00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:30.796 align:middle line:84%
If statistics make you more
comfortable and more empowered,

00:58:30.796 --> 00:58:32.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
you those statistics,

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:33.750 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to analyze it.

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:35.270 align:middle line:90%
If you go, I don't want to know.

00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:36.740 align:middle line:84%
I had a cancer
patient, she was--

00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:39.860 align:middle line:84%
actually, a big institution,
Mr. Cancer, found it.

00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:41.150 align:middle line:90%
It was ovarian cancer.

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:42.330 align:middle line:90%
It was still encapsulated.

00:58:42.330 --> 00:58:44.210 align:middle line:84%
They would have done a
morcellation procedure

00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:45.410 align:middle line:90%
and spread it.

00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Saved it, got it, and I knew
that patient really well.

00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And I knew if I told her the
statistics on ovarian cancer,

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:56.180 align:middle line:84%
she'd probably be dead within
six months to a year, which is

00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:58.060 align:middle line:90%
what the statistics would say.

00:58:58.060 --> 00:58:59.060 align:middle line:90%
She didn't want to know.

00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
didn't tell her.

00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: I said,
do you want to know?

00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:02.806 align:middle line:90%
She says, do I want to know?

00:59:02.806 --> 00:59:04.172 align:middle line:90%
And I said, do you want to know?

00:59:04.172 --> 00:59:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you said, do I?

00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: And I knew.

00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I know you
well enough-- because she

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:09.440 align:middle line:90%
was a friend and a patient.

00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:11.210 align:middle line:84%
I know you well
enough, and I think

00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:13.107 align:middle line:84%
you-- let's just live
the healthy lifestyle,

00:59:13.107 --> 00:59:14.690 align:middle line:84%
and let's do everything
we want to do.

00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:16.356 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what
happened with her?

00:59:16.356 --> 00:59:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: She's almost three
years out, no sign of cancer.

00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: I still don't want her
to know what those statistics

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.860 align:middle line:90%
are, and she doesn't.

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:25.550 align:middle line:90%
She hasn't looked.

00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:28.374 align:middle line:84%
She's head of a major university
integrative medicine program,

00:59:28.374 --> 00:59:29.540 align:middle line:90%
and she didn't want to know.

00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And I knew she
didn't need to know.

00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:31.880 align:middle line:90%
It depends.

00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:34.400 align:middle line:84%
What gives you
empowerment and comfort?

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:35.570 align:middle line:90%
That's what my book's about.

00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:38.291 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm
about, individual.

00:59:38.291 --> 00:59:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The book coming out?

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: What's going
to help you heal?

00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "What to Do in 72".

00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Yes, yes.

00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:44.597 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 72 hours, stop,
don't get into the system.

00:59:44.597 --> 00:59:46.096 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Give
yourself a game-plan.

00:59:46.096 --> 00:59:47.990 align:middle line:10%
Here's your checklist,
and get yourself

00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:50.210 align:middle line:10%
ready to make those
important decisions

00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:52.590 align:middle line:10%
for your life and your care.

00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Donese,
thank you so much.

00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:56.714 align:middle line:84%
I know that you've helped a lot
of people, in this conversation

00:59:56.714 --> 00:59:58.631 align:middle line:84%
today, just quiet the
whole conversation down.

00:59:58.631 --> 00:59:59.713 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE: Thank you, yeah.

00:59:59.713 --> 01:00:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you bring--

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:01.640 align:middle line:90%
it's not just hope.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.976 align:middle line:90%
You actually bring solutions.

01:00:02.976 --> 01:00:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE: Well,
thank you very much.

01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:05.009 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

01:00:05.009 --> 01:00:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, thank you.

01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:08.330 align:middle line:84%
We'll continue our
conversation with the topic

01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:11.330 align:middle line:84%
of energy medicine and the
fact that its time has come.

01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:14.480 align:middle line:10%
It changes the way we heal our
energetic systems, which is

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.770 align:middle line:10%
what we are made of ourselves.

01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:18.770 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you
for joining us here on Gaia.
