>> REGINA MEREDITH: This
interview could be called "What

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.670 align:middle line:10%
the Bleep Do We Know
About Suffering Anyway?"

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.730 align:middle line:10%
by film producer William Arntz.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.920 align:middle line:10%
His new work guides us
through the ins and outs

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.740 align:middle line:10%
of suffering as a DIY
experience rather than

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.430 align:middle line:10%
by interviewing the experts
as he did in his famous film

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.320 align:middle line:10%
"What the Bleep Do We Know?"

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.480 align:middle line:84%
We're now into
metaphysics and quantum

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.082 align:middle line:84%
physics with his new book "How
To Suffer in 10 Easy Steps."

00:00:43.082 --> 00:00:44.790 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I
think everyone's going

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.200 align:middle line:90%
to want to know, wait a minute.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.310 align:middle line:84%
We all know you from "What
the Bleep Do We Know?"

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And it launched the
careers of so many people.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.995 align:middle line:84%
And now this is what,
16, 17 years ago?

00:00:53.995 --> 00:00:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>WILL ARNTZ: Mm-hmm.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I still remember
it playing in college theaters

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:90%
across the country.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was really,
in the day, it

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.890 align:middle line:84%
was one of the first profound
films with wide distribution

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.800 align:middle line:84%
that helped us understand that
this matrix of mind, body,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and expectation and belief
was what creates this reality.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.580 align:middle line:90%
Now, we think of it--

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.130 align:middle line:84%
everybody kind of folds that
in, everybody watching this.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.290 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't known in
that day as it is today.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.723 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
bringing that work.

00:01:25.723 --> 00:01:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to
say, too, that you're

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:90%
continuing with this work.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.807 align:middle line:10%
You were even going
to do a sequel, right?

00:01:31.807 --> 00:01:32.640 align:middle line:10%
>>WILL ARNTZ: Right.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.150 align:middle line:10%
I was.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You were
going to do a sequel.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.422 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about what
happened, because you did

00:01:37.422 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:90%
a lot of research for years.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.842 align:middle line:84%
You decided not
to do the sequel.

00:01:40.842 --> 00:01:42.300 align:middle line:10%
You've written this
incredible book

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:10%
that we're going to be
talking about today,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.100 align:middle line:10%
and you've formed a
relationship with Gaia,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.030 align:middle line:10%
so you're part of
our family now.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.720 align:middle line:84%
What happened after
"What the Bleep?"

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.525 align:middle line:84%
What happened to the sequel,
and what's going on with Gaia?

00:01:54.525 --> 00:01:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Well, what happened
with the sequel is I

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.945 align:middle line:84%
started-- it was
originally called "What

00:01:58.945 --> 00:01:59.820 align:middle line:90%
the Bleep, Now What?"

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.202 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: And the
idea was "Now What?"

00:02:02.202 --> 00:02:05.310 align:middle line:84%
is like after "What the
Bleep?" now, what's new.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.200 align:middle line:84%
So I went and interviewed
all these folks.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And I kept asking him what's
new, what's new, what's new?

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out there
wasn't that much new.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.340 align:middle line:90%
I was a little disappointed.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.350 align:middle line:84%
I figured there was going
to be all this stuff.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:84%
I had one of these guys
who worked on the big thing

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:90%
over in Switzerland.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what's
new in quantum?

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, we
found the Higgs.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.983 align:middle line:90%
But that just--

00:02:28.983 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The Higgs
boson, yeah, right.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yeah.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, I talked
to everyone and I'm like,

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.060 align:middle line:84%
well, there isn't that much
new, and I wasn't that inspired.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought,
you know, I'm

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.060 align:middle line:84%
just kind of hitting
the repeat button.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm just trying to do it again.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.778 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't that inspired, and
making a film is so much work.

00:02:49.778 --> 00:02:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, boy, yeah.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.653 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Oh, my god.

00:02:51.653 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm like, you know,
unless you're obsessed,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle line:84%
you have to be obsessed
to make a great film.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.900 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't obsessed.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.010 align:middle line:84%
So I just took all those--
all the disk drives

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.523 align:middle line:84%
and put 'em in a
closet somewhere

00:03:03.523 --> 00:03:04.440 align:middle line:90%
where they're sitting.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:90%
They may emerge at some point.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you know, I'm
really happy to hear you say

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.350 align:middle line:84%
this because it is so tempting
when someone's had a big hit

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.490 align:middle line:84%
to keep trying to play the
game, and most people do.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.502 align:middle line:84%
And the information does
become stale and redundant.

00:03:20.502 --> 00:03:22.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've dealt with a
lot of it sitting over here

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:23.910 align:middle line:90%
in this chair--

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
keeping the same
gig going, trying

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.390 align:middle line:90%
to find a little new spin on it.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
you recognized--

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.650 align:middle line:84%
you kind of hit the essential
truths in the first one.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Right.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And those are truths
that have not gone stale.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:84%
We still have not really
learned to live them even

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.158 align:middle line:90%
to this point, by and large.

00:03:41.158 --> 00:03:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to comment
on that, because it's

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.210 align:middle line:84%
one thing to understand how the
mind/body matrix and the nature

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:90%
of reality works.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.660 align:middle line:84%
It's another thing to have
the discipline, the knowledge,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.305 align:middle line:84%
the practice to make
it real for you.

00:03:58.305 --> 00:03:59.203 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yeah.

00:03:59.203 --> 00:04:00.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a whole--

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could say, oh,
you create your reality.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Your reality starts internally,
and you create your reality.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's true.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.210 align:middle line:84%
However, we're also co-creating
it with everyone else

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.360 align:middle line:90%
because we're connected.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.019 align:middle line:84%
So my reality is not
separate from your reality.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:90%
So that's a big thing.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And then other things,
even internally, you

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.410 align:middle line:84%
can say, oh, I create
this, but then you

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.140 align:middle line:84%
have all the subconscious
and unconscious things

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.540 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
basically mess it up.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So you have to do the
internal work also

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.500 align:middle line:84%
to do that and be,
you know, cognizant

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.310 align:middle line:90%
of what's happening out there.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the simple
like, oh, I just

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.760 align:middle line:84%
thought I'm going to get a brand
new Mercedes, and it shows up.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It wasn't
the silver bullet.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yeah.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, the interesting
thing about that, OK,

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:84%
so "The Secret"
comes along, right?

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So everyone thinks, oh, I'll
just do my vision board.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, and that's
interesting, and I've

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.930 align:middle line:84%
talked about this on a
couple of programs before.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Because depending on the way
someone constructed that,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.840 align:middle line:84%
the nature of their
mind and clarity

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and will, attention,
emotion, and desire,

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.740 align:middle line:84%
some people do have that
Mercedes just kind of show

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:90%
up, so to speak.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.840 align:middle line:90%
That's rare.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.770 align:middle line:90%
It does happen.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, they
chose people in that film

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.420 align:middle line:84%
who have a little
easier time with that,

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:84%
who it's a more natural
state of affairs for,

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.770 align:middle line:84%
trying to tell the average
person that's grokking it

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.990 align:middle line:84%
for the first time,
you can do this, too.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.060 align:middle line:90%
No, you can't, necessarily.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.850 align:middle line:84%
What you mentioned was
really critically important

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:31.960 align:middle line:90%
a moment ago.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can set
your intention.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Then you are dealing with your
kids or your mother, father,

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:90%
sister, husband, or whatnot.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.220 align:middle line:84%
That reality
changes pretty fast.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Your intention can
change really fast

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.100 align:middle line:84%
if you're, say, pissed off
or something at someone.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yep, yep, yep.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.430 align:middle line:90%
It's so true.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:90%
And also, you have all your--

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.847 align:middle line:84%
in "What the Bleep?" we talked
about emotional addiction and

00:05:52.847 --> 00:05:54.430 align:middle line:84%
how you have those
things, and they'll

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.850 align:middle line:90%
take you off on another path.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So "The Secret," it was
nice, but, you know,

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.940 align:middle line:90%
there was a whole lot more.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.740 align:middle line:90%
And I think--

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It was too
one-dimensional and not

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:84%
instructive enough into
understanding the minefield

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.500 align:middle line:84%
that it is to go through
the mind, the subconscious,

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.080 align:middle line:84%
the emotions, and
that whole matrix.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:84%
You still have to
contend with it.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: You have to go on
the path of self discovery.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Bingo

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, bingo.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.530 align:middle line:90%
So now, tell us what's going on.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.125 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've partnered
up with Gaia.

00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yeah.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.417 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so
what's going on there?

00:06:27.417 --> 00:06:30.610 align:middle line:84%
This is a brand new
relationship to be revealed,

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.580 align:middle line:84%
to an extent, 'cause I know some
things are kind of under wraps

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.520 align:middle line:84%
for the moment and being talked
about in production circles

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.230 align:middle line:84%
here, but I don't know
what they are yet.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you even
know what they are yet.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.542 align:middle line:84%
But what are you kind of
thinking in this relationship?

00:06:42.542 --> 00:06:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Recently, I just
started feeling like, you know?

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing anything with it.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And if someone could
take this and develop it

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.420 align:middle line:90%
further and really run with it.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that Gaia wants
to do is do a lot of dubs

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.830 align:middle line:84%
in foreign languages and
then get it out to the world.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.020 align:middle line:90%
And I realized, oh, my god.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.830 align:middle line:84%
The big reason I made the movie
was to get this information out

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.353 align:middle line:84%
to the world, and here's this
partner who wants to do that.

00:07:10.353 --> 00:07:11.395 align:middle line:90%
So what am I waiting for?

00:07:11.395 --> 00:07:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And how's the
distribution, that's for sure?

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.490 align:middle line:90%
Gaia is a large company.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: And then also
the future things.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I still think
well, maybe at some point,

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.990 align:middle line:84%
I'll wake up, and the hand
of the Lord will touch me,

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.070 align:middle line:90%
and I'll be all inspired.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:90%
We'll do "Bleep 2?"

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And even if that happens
now, because, I mean,

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.840 align:middle line:90%
here we are in the big studios.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Gaia has all the equipment,
the studios to do it.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.222 align:middle line:84%
And really, half the people
I've interviewed for "Bleep 2"--

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:37.555 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --are on Gaia anyway.

00:07:37.555 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Bingo.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you know,
I think it would be--

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.000 align:middle line:90%
this is just my take now--

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I think it would be really
interesting to go in to

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.980 align:middle line:90%
"What the Bleep Do We Know?"

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.330 align:middle line:90%
into that next layer.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.800 align:middle line:90%
Like, OK, you saw the film.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.970 align:middle line:90%
You gave it a shot.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And some of you, you
gave "The Secret" a shot.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And then you felt
like you were somehow

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.610 align:middle line:84%
a failure at the
other end because you

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.100 align:middle line:84%
couldn't seem to employ it
to get what you wanted out

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.180 align:middle line:90%
of your life.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And talk about all those
dynamics we just mentioned.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Mm-hmm.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the things
that "Bleep" also did

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.875 align:middle line:84%
was the idea of science
and spirituality.

00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: And part
of the reason I

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.487 align:middle line:84%
used the language of
science, part of it

00:08:14.487 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:84%
'cause I was physicist,
so I tend to go there.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.200 align:middle line:84%
But back when the film was
made, if you told people

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:84%
you were meditating
and what not,

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.620 align:middle line:90%
people thought you were crazy.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.830 align:middle line:84%
So but if you say it in
the language of science,

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.830 align:middle line:84%
then suddenly, it's like, well,
I'm going to listen to you now

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.070 align:middle line:90%
and respect it.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.179 align:middle line:84%
So part of that was
bringing the science in

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:38.470 align:middle line:84%
to basically give it some
respectability in the society.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Now that that's
happened, it's really,

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.929 align:middle line:84%
what about the personal
journey that you have to take?

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:46.120 align:middle line:90%
That's really much more--

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.320 align:middle line:90%
that's the next step.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's kind of what
I'm talking about with you,

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And here we are at a time
where the whole COVID

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:57.670 align:middle line:84%
phenomena has swept through
the countries of the world.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.970 align:middle line:84%
People are left
with new questions,

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.760 align:middle line:84%
ideally, left with
questions about,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.870 align:middle line:84%
was this former way of
living really working for me?

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Is that what I had intended
to manifest for a life?

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Or was it simply running
on autopilot and programs?

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like this is a good
time to go back and revisit,

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.450 align:middle line:84%
go deeper this time,
and look at our creation

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and what we're offering
of ourselves in the world.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.790 align:middle line:84%
So it sounds like this
could be pretty good timing

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.390 align:middle line:84%
for a world that should be
more reflective at this moment

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.680 align:middle line:90%
than it was in the past.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Well, and it's
definitely going to happen.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.215 align:middle line:84%
I mean, basically, you
think about a retreat.

00:09:37.215 --> 00:09:38.590 align:middle line:84%
If you go into
spiritual retreat,

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.255 align:middle line:90%
it's that you leave your life.

00:09:40.255 --> 00:09:42.130 align:middle line:84%
You'll leave it all
behind, your normal life,

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.135 align:middle line:90%
and you go off somewhere.

00:09:43.135 --> 00:09:43.935 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:09:43.935 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Well,
everyone-- this is

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.560 align:middle line:84%
the first time in the
history of the planet where

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.090 align:middle line:84%
the whole planet's
been put on retreat.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Think about it.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:51.690 align:middle line:90%
No, it's amazing.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: It's a
completely new phenomena.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And so part of in the
collective unconscious, everyone

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:90%
is experiencing the same thing.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's a planetary
initiation, essentially,

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:90%
is what's going to happen.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:08.215 align:middle line:84%
And the thing with initiations
is it can go one of two ways.

00:10:08.215 --> 00:10:09.938 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, depending on us.

00:10:09.938 --> 00:10:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Depending on us.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's interesting
because it promises to--

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.560 align:middle line:84%
at this point, it's already
happening-- collapse

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.920 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the old structures,
including there's

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.030 align:middle line:84%
going to be a lot
of ramifications

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:29.200 align:middle line:84%
in our economic world
around us, and that's

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.720 align:middle line:84%
going to affect us on
deeply personal levels.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.780 align:middle line:84%
But again, that
world was created

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:40.120 align:middle line:84%
in such an unthoughtful way,
in a way that exploits so many

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and serves so few, that we
fight and think, oh, no.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.420 align:middle line:84%
We don't want the stock
markets of the world to crash.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.470 align:middle line:84%
We don't want our, you know, to
have our GDP drop and all that.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:54.100 align:middle line:84%
But then you stop and look
at it and say, OK, we're

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.270 align:middle line:84%
going to have to rip the
Band-Aid off at some point.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Where do we get down to
an organic way of living,

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.690 align:middle line:90%
an organic connected economy?

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:90%
When do we let it die?

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.883 align:middle line:84%
Just let it do a
freefall to an extent.

00:11:06.883 --> 00:11:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we still have to
eat and live and have jobs.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:14.030 align:middle line:84%
But I think if we even have
that internal intention,

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.820 align:middle line:84%
we can contend with what's
going to be happening

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.530 align:middle line:84%
over the next couple
of years, I think,

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.810 align:middle line:84%
better and create something
more beautiful out of it.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.102 align:middle line:90%
What are your thoughts on that?

00:11:22.102 --> 00:11:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Well, I think
it's going to make people

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.980 align:middle line:90%
reflect on their core values.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.120 align:middle line:84%
What is really important, and
what gives you a good life?

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching
Governor Cuomo talk.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, you
know, everyone, I just

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.170 align:middle line:84%
had a two-hour conversation
with my daughter.

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:84%
I've never had a two-hour
conversation with my daughter.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.150 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you what
that meant to me.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And so you start saying,
well, all this stuff

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:51.040 align:middle line:84%
what we were doing to give
ourselves a great life,

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.190 align:middle line:90%
it didn't really do it.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.100 align:middle line:90%
But what is, what is important?

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.562 align:middle line:84%
It's those moments
that you have.

00:11:55.562 --> 00:11:57.520 align:middle line:84%
It's the moments when
you connect with someone.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the moments where
you get an inspiration

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:84%
or you read something, or you
learn the piece and, you know?

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:08.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily having
the new granite countertops

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.503 align:middle line:90%
for the kitchen.

00:12:09.503 --> 00:12:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: So I think that the
people are going to-- on this

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.400 align:middle line:90%
retreat--

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.600 align:middle line:90%
are going to look at that.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, the trouble with this is,
and this is the suffering part

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.590 align:middle line:84%
of it, is whenever you take
stuff away from people, all

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.710 align:middle line:84%
the stuff that we've created
to make our life what

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:90%
it is, you take it all away.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Think about a four-year-old.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.380 align:middle line:84%
What happens when suddenly,
you take away the thing

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.355 align:middle line:90%
they're playing.

00:12:33.355 --> 00:12:34.570 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:84%
So there's going to be
an emotional reaction.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --freaking out.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.395 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: People are
going to freak out.

00:12:38.395 --> 00:12:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So the important thing
is, I think, to let people

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.480 align:middle line:84%
know, OK, you're going
to be freaking out,

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.800 align:middle line:84%
and your friends are
going to be freaking out,

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and people are
going to be angry.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.835 align:middle line:84%
But you have to realize it's
the process we're going through.

00:12:48.835 --> 00:12:49.635 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:12:49.635 --> 00:12:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And keep those core
values in mind.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:52.810 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
thing in California

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:84%
where I live which was not
terribly affected by all of it.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
living a rural life there.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that
happened from--

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.150 align:middle line:84%
they never closed the
gardening centers.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Those things look like
Black Friday at a mall.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.140 align:middle line:84%
All of the centers
were packed with nearly

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.960 align:middle line:84%
having to go to overflow
parking to get their plants

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and their seeds in the
ground and grow gardens.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm already-- I'm one of
them, had the time, right?

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:90%
We're already sautéing zucchini.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.680 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like I've never
had a garden come

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.130 align:middle line:90%
to fruition that early.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.740 align:middle line:84%
But we jumped on it because
hey, there's some sunshine.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.060 align:middle line:90%
It's California soil.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So gardening, people out
walking with their kids,

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.490 align:middle line:84%
bicycling with their kids,
spending a lot more time

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.990 align:middle line:84%
together as family
even if they're

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.520 align:middle line:90%
driving each other nuts.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.990 align:middle line:84%
They're getting to know one
another in a much deeper way.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say this
is odd because it's in--

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.080 align:middle line:84%
we're still in that phase
where people are being,

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.740 align:middle line:84%
thankfully, subsidized with
government checks and such.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.420 align:middle line:84%
The freak-out
hasn't started yet.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.460 align:middle line:84%
It's still part of the
calm at this moment.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And in this space, I've heard
people say that they like it.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.710 align:middle line:90%
You know, I kind of like this.

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:09.300 align:middle line:84%
My phone's not
ringing all the time.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't have appointments I have
to be at where they'd always

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.675 align:middle line:90%
overpack their calendars.

00:14:13.675 --> 00:14:14.535 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Right.

00:14:14.535 --> 00:14:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So there's something
beautiful trying to birth right

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.030 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Right.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, I think I agree with you.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.860 align:middle line:84%
I think society,
this modern society

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:90%
got way off, way off course.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And the technology that we've
all developed to help us,

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:34.770 align:middle line:84%
to give us a better life, the
guardians become the guards.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, now, it's
the prison keep.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And where people-- you know,
I did a software company

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.380 align:middle line:90%
20 years ago.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.030 align:middle line:90%
I had two of them, actually.

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And back then-- this
was before cell phones

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.190 align:middle line:84%
and really the internet--
you know, I worked very hard.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:49.590 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the day,
I went home and I was done.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.540 align:middle line:84%
I know people now
in the software.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And they, you know, 2
o'clock Sunday morning, they

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:54.900 align:middle line:90%
get a phone call.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.445 align:middle line:84%
Hey, we're going to do a
demo over here in Germany,

00:14:57.445 --> 00:14:58.320 align:middle line:90%
and it's not working.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.130 align:middle line:90%
You got to fix it.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
no way to live.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: It's no way to live.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:01.983 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No way to live.

00:15:01.983 --> 00:15:02.915 align:middle line:90%
So we're in agreement.

00:15:02.915 --> 00:15:05.040 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone watching
is probably in agreement.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:05.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.240 align:middle line:90%
What were you going to say?

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: I was going to say,
you know, even according--

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.675 align:middle line:90%
and you read the Good Book.

00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:12.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Good Lord
needs to take a day off.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, there you go.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.833 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Come on everyone,
you can take a day off.

00:15:14.833 --> 00:15:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.203 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, we're going
to talk about what

00:15:18.203 --> 00:15:19.620 align:middle line:84%
happens down the
road a little bit

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.412 align:middle line:84%
when all these four-year-olds,
all of us four-year-olds

00:15:22.412 --> 00:15:24.870 align:middle line:84%
have the Band-Aid ripped off,
and all of our little comfort

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:27.540 align:middle line:84%
creatures may not be
available, and we may not

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.550 align:middle line:84%
be able to afford a lot of them
depending on our situation,

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.350 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.420 align:middle line:90%
And so now comes the suffering.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.321 align:middle line:84%
I think your book's
right on time.

00:15:36.321 --> 00:15:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: "How to Suffer
in 10 Easy Steps."

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.170 align:middle line:90%
So let's get into that.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.517 align:middle line:84%
So the first
question I was going

00:15:44.517 --> 00:15:45.600 align:middle line:90%
to ask you about all that.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there is
sufficient enough suffering

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.595 align:middle line:84%
about to mount in the world to
start addressing the subject?

00:15:51.595 --> 00:15:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: I think so.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, I've
recently been getting calls

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.840 align:middle line:84%
from radio stations
saying, hey, yeah.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.360 align:middle line:84%
We weren't interested three
months ago in interviewing you

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.500 align:middle line:84%
about this book, but what
are you doing tomorrow?

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.637 align:middle line:84%
So it's because people
are really suffering.

00:16:08.637 --> 00:16:10.595 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, they're
start-- it's starting.

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: It's really happening.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Alcoholism.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:17.150 align:middle line:84%
The alcohol aisles in the
store, I notice, to cope.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:21.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the only area that has
one-way traffic, protected

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.210 align:middle line:84%
because of theft in
the alcohol aisles.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Trader Joe's-- within the first
week, I saw people crating out,

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:33.740 align:middle line:84%
you know, whole cases of wine
when panicking first started.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.650 align:middle line:90%
So this is one coping mechanism.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:39.200 align:middle line:84%
That's going to cause a lot
of backlash and problems.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Just addictions of every kind,
whether it's food or alcohol

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.450 align:middle line:90%
or drugs, people are in it.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: People are in it, and
it's going to get worse, so.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm, and
it is going to get worse.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.990 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there is
sufficient suffering

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.880 align:middle line:90%
that your book is now timely.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
suffering and embracing it,

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.840 align:middle line:84%
because personally, I'm really
big on avoidance of suffering.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Everyone is.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.069 align:middle line:84%
It's the one thing--
no one wants to suffer,

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:05.250 align:middle line:90%
and yet, everyone does.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:07.140 align:middle line:90%
That's why there's easy steps.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.880 align:middle line:10%
Because everyone's doing it.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.680 align:middle line:10%
It's easy.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.630 align:middle line:10%
That's kind of the joke.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:10%
And the book started off as
a satire of self-help books.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:10%
Sort of like you
can have it all.

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:10%
You can be infinitely wealthy
in these six easy steps.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.730 align:middle line:84%
You can find your true
love and all that.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.730 align:middle line:84%
But really, all of those
things underneath the cover

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.790 align:middle line:84%
is an avoidance thing
like you were saying.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So oh, five easy steps
to be infinitely wealthy

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.830 align:middle line:90%
so you won't suffer lack.

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.490 align:middle line:90%
Suffering is at the base, yeah.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:36.907 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Suffering's
at the base--

00:17:36.907 --> 00:17:39.710 align:middle line:84%
finding true love so you
won't suffer loneliness.

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.232 align:middle line:84%
So there's all those sort of
subtle connections going on.

00:17:42.232 --> 00:17:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's
get to the suffering,

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.867 align:middle line:84%
get clear with it first
because there's a lot to it.

00:17:46.867 --> 00:17:48.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of
people say, oh, well,

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.090 align:middle line:84%
that's just another
illusion, too.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:51.920 align:middle line:84%
When I say I'm not
big on suffering,

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm not big on
prolonged suffering.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:84%
On a personal
level, if something

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.770 align:middle line:84%
is bothering me and
going deep, I just

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:04.580 align:middle line:84%
burst out in tears and sob and
sit with it, and there it is.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can't stop it.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.840 align:middle line:90%
It's just there.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And then when it kind
of processes through

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:84%
and you think about it and,
where do I fit in this?

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.250 align:middle line:90%
What have I done?

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:90%
What can I do?

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.970 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of over then
until the next time.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:21.920 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not really big on--

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:84%
you know, in the New
Age days in particular,

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:84%
oh I'm just processing,
dragging things from day to day

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.090 align:middle line:84%
and prolonging the
constant over-- to me--

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:36.030 align:middle line:84%
overanalysis of things
that aren't working.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Well, you know, the
whole New Age spiritual thing,

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, part of that was
like, if you were suffering,

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.640 align:middle line:90%
you failed.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: You're not supposed to.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.100 align:middle line:84%
So there was a guilt
thing associated with it,

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.050 align:middle line:90%
and that's bogus.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:51.240 align:middle line:84%
But what you
describe, what you do,

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.790 align:middle line:84%
that's because you've been
doing self discovery for years.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.220 align:middle line:90%
And so you realize that--

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.658 align:middle line:84%
and I talk about
this in the book.

00:18:56.658 --> 00:18:57.950 align:middle line:90%
I call it the girl in the room.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.630 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't deal with it.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't deal with
it and look directly at it

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and experience it,
whether it's crying,

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:84%
whether it's going, you
know, kicking something

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.250 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you
would do to do that.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Or the self
reflection, say, I am

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.890 align:middle line:84%
suffering because I did
something really bad.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, what do I do to get-- you
know, and that sort of thing.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.250 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, like you say,

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:90%
you just keep kicking it on.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.233 align:middle line:90%
Suffering is often a habit.

00:19:26.233 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I'm saying,

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.680 align:middle line:90%
and that was called processing.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
called it that, and I

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.500 align:middle line:90%
get really bored with that.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to hear about it.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: People loop.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.590 align:middle line:90%
They process.

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And then talk about
emotional addiction,

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.010 align:middle line:84%
they get addicted
to that whole loop.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Boom, boom, boom.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And when you think
about it again,

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:48.740 align:middle line:84%
when we were little
kids, we would--

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.230 align:middle line:84%
we suffered a lot because we
didn't get what we wanted.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You cry, and
then you're off playing with

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.210 align:middle line:90%
your friend.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Right.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.030 align:middle line:84%
But we have those
neural nets in there.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And so people, you
fall back into--

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.860 align:middle line:84%
I have a chapter on Buddha
since he's one of the big guys

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.120 align:middle line:90%
to talk about this.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was coming up
with the title for it.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And the title came out,
Buddha Breaks the Habit.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: And it is
in not all cases,

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:15.360 align:middle line:84%
but it is in certain cases, it's
a habit that we just go into.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is
if you can realize,

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:19.820 align:middle line:84%
this is where the
awareness comes in.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not looking
at suffering directly, then

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.490 align:middle line:84%
you just repeat, and
you go on autopilot.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.730 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at it, and
you go, oh, in this case,

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:29.870 align:middle line:90%
this is just a habit.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:33.350 align:middle line:84%
This is just where I go
to when this happens.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:34.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a habit.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
now you have a chance

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.610 align:middle line:90%
to do something about it.

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:84%
But otherwise, you're just
autopilot which is so much

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:90%
what people experience.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And it also is completely,
and I don't mean this-- again,

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to remove all
New Age language just

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.330 align:middle line:90%
is a practical discussion.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.970 align:middle line:84%
But it also takes you
out of the moment.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.950 align:middle line:84%
When you have this
habit of suffering,

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:84%
you're not in the
present moment.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.695 align:middle line:90%
You're not in now.

00:20:58.695 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Little kids are in the now.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.550 align:middle line:90%
They're suffering right now.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:02.430 align:middle line:90%
They get over it.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:03.270 align:middle line:90%
They move on.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And then when the
next now comes,

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.380 align:middle line:84%
they go through
their little process.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:84%
But they're not dragging it
forward because children tend

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.060 align:middle line:84%
to live in the moment
where adults don't.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Most adults have lost the
ability to stay in the moment.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Right.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.610 align:middle line:90%
And that goes both ways.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Either you-- I have
one chapter, it's

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:24.120 align:middle line:90%
called The Power of Not Now.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:84%
The power of not
now is in suffering.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:29.520 align:middle line:84%
So the power of not now, if
you can live in the past,

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.550 align:middle line:84%
and you think about the things
someone did in high school

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.490 align:middle line:84%
where you were embarrassed,
and it screwed you all up.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Or In the future, you're worried
about something happening.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.638 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: So that's the power
of not now is it could really--

00:21:44.638 --> 00:21:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --could mess you up.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.278 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: --could mess you up.

00:21:47.278 --> 00:21:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So and you're
talking about, you know,

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.210 align:middle line:90%
suffering is a choice, right?

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:54.095 align:middle line:84%
Well, who chooses
to suffer, right?

00:21:54.095 --> 00:21:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Well, we say suf--

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you say
it's not really a choice.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.035 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: It's not a--

00:21:58.035 --> 00:21:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Like you
say, it's more a habit.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times, people
say so suffering's a choice.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.360 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.485 align:middle line:84%
You can be really smug
about it that way, you know?

00:22:05.485 --> 00:22:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yeah, people say that.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.670 align:middle line:90%
It's just a, you know.

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Or people quote the old Buddha
saying, Pain is unavoidable.

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:15.120 align:middle line:90%
Suffering is optional.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.007 align:middle line:90%
That's another quote.

00:22:16.007 --> 00:22:17.340 align:middle line:90%
So you're not supposed to do it.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.465 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And that's true.

00:22:18.465 --> 00:22:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: But, you know, come on.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:25.270 align:middle line:84%
A loved one is in a
car accident and dies.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:29.308 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you're going to say, oh, I
choose not to suffer over that.

00:22:29.308 --> 00:22:30.350 align:middle line:90%
That's called repression.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.618 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: I mean,
there's a certain thing.

00:22:32.618 --> 00:22:36.520 align:middle line:84%
The suffering happens where
it takes you internally.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.000 align:middle line:90%
And so we sort of--

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.210 align:middle line:84%
if you sort of get
back to the beginning,

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.670 align:middle line:84%
one's attitude about
suffering is so important.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you think,
oh, just, you know,

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.100 align:middle line:84%
lousy stuff happens to
me, that's one thing.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Or we think, oh, I
create all my suffering.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.120 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, you don't create it.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Just like this COVID thing.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's life.

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:54.890 align:middle line:90%
There are cycles.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: It just happens to you.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.840 align:middle line:84%
So then the question is, how
are you going to relate to it?

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.630 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to go
into the victim thing

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.922 align:middle line:84%
and just blame other
people and do that,

00:23:03.922 --> 00:23:05.380 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to get the lesson.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Fundamentally, my sense
is all the suffering

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:12.200 align:middle line:84%
has a lesson for us,
and it's often painful.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.770 align:middle line:84%
But for myself, when
I've changed the most,

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:17.600 align:middle line:84%
transformed the most, it's
due to some pretty intense

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.400 align:middle line:90%
suffering.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And humanity is
kind of that way.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.790 align:middle line:90%
Why we're that way?

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, we could talk
for many hours on that,

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.150 align:middle line:90%
but that's where we're at.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Now, all right.

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that
suffering is something

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.240 align:middle line:84%
that we need to do
more gracefully.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.300 align:middle line:84%
We need to do it in a
way that is, let's even

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:37.210 align:middle line:84%
say, works toward our
growth but is also

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:40.210 align:middle line:84%
maybe more efficient than
making a habit of it, right?

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Right.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you say
more gracefully,

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.290 align:middle line:84%
if you step back
from that, you say

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.620 align:middle line:84%
there's different strategies
you can take to deal with it.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:53.200 align:middle line:90%
And gracefulness is one thing.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.980 align:middle line:90%
One is stoicism.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.130 align:middle line:90%
One is surrender.

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's different
ways that you can actually

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:03.820 align:middle line:90%
relate to it.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is part of what
I talked about in the book.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like you get to choose how
you're going to relate to it.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.080 align:middle line:90%
That's the choice you have.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.688 align:middle line:84%
You may not choose whether
the event comes to you or not.

00:24:13.688 --> 00:24:15.105 align:middle line:84%
You get to choose
how you respond.

00:24:15.105 --> 00:24:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How do you
respond to suffering?

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Well, it
depends on what it is.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.710 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you know--

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --which
area of life or--

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: If I was
doing a self-help book,

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.537 align:middle line:84%
I would have formulas
for all this, right?

00:24:25.537 --> 00:24:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you suffer,
you blah, blah, blah.

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:29.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's different
for every individual,

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's different for
the what's happening.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, if I do
something that hurts someone,

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:42.140 align:middle line:90%
my response is to make amends.

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: You know, it's
something very active.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You approach it
very actively and directly.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: You do that.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.460 align:middle line:90%
And you make amends.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.480 align:middle line:84%
You do whatever you can
to set things right.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.740 align:middle line:90%
Of course, you apologize.

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.600 align:middle line:84%
But then you don't
just apologize,

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.640 align:middle line:84%
you do something
even beyond that.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.050 align:middle line:90%
So that's one thing.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.880 align:middle line:84%
But there's other
times when you're

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.950 align:middle line:84%
suffering of, let's say, a great
injustice, a great injustice.

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:08.830 align:middle line:84%
You and your friends are
suffering a great injustice.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:10.900 align:middle line:84%
So what you're going
to do is you're

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.700 align:middle line:84%
going to start maybe walking
up and down the street

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:14.500 align:middle line:90%
with a sign.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who knows what
you're going to do,

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.657 align:middle line:84%
but you'll do
something like that.

00:25:17.657 --> 00:25:21.730 align:middle line:84%
So really, it depends
on what it is.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:25.120 align:middle line:84%
But, again, stepping back
a thing, you look at it.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.240 align:middle line:84%
You say, what's my
strategy going to be?

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.280 align:middle line:90%
How am I going to react?

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is a time, like
you said, to just be graceful

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:35.590 align:middle line:90%
about it, just to be graceful.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:36.565 align:middle line:90%
Just say--

00:25:36.565 --> 00:25:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's here.

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, how much
reflection can I do?

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.868 align:middle line:84%
How much can I have
an effect to change?

00:25:42.868 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned
something a moment ago.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.610 align:middle line:84%
If you've hurt
someone, for example,

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:52.000 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times, what people
do is let a little time pass,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.250 align:middle line:84%
hope no one really
actually noticed--

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.240 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean--

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.130 align:middle line:90%
and try to gloss it over.

00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk
about what happens

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.220 align:middle line:90%
when we try to gloss it over.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Well, when you
try to gloss it over,

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.830 align:middle line:84%
then it goes into
the unconscious.

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, it's
down there wreaking havoc.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And who knows what
is going to do.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And then you're something that
you're avoiding, so you just--

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.530 align:middle line:90%
you can't go there.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:21.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a concept I
talk about in the book.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a concept from the Kabbalah
and the Jewish tradition

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.180 align:middle line:90%
of tikkun olam.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is, OK, if you
harm someone, of course,

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.210 align:middle line:84%
you apologize, but
you must make repair.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:38.070 align:middle line:84%
That you don't actually get
out of it until you make repair

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:39.730 align:middle line:90%
and you do whatever you can.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's also interesting--
that's part of the 12-step

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.970 align:middle line:90%
program--

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:46.930 align:middle line:84%
is that if you do that, you
have to go find everyone

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:50.710 align:middle line:84%
that your addiction has
hurt and attempt repair.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
energetically about that.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:58.490 align:middle line:90%
By doing the repair you--

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:01.840 align:middle line:84%
as my wife Deirdre says-- when
you do that, you're actually

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.280 align:middle line:90%
repairing God.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.080 align:middle line:90%
You're repairing the universe.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.200 align:middle line:84%
By doing that repair, not
only are you repairing that,

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.440 align:middle line:84%
but it's something that's
even broader, because we all

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:90%
make mistakes.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.930 align:middle line:90%
We all hurt people.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:15.340 align:middle line:90%
We all screw up.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.310 align:middle line:84%
But by doing that, you're
acknowledging that and saying,

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.810 align:middle line:90%
but there's a way forward.

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.250 align:middle line:90%
So it takes it--

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:24.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so when you have
a lemon, make lemonade.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So even though you did
screw something up,

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:28.660 align:middle line:84%
by doing the repair,
you're actually

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.810 align:middle line:84%
doing something overall
that's positive.

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And so there, you
get to the thing

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:84%
that the suffering can
trigger something that's

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.930 align:middle line:90%
really transformative and good.

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:39.357 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I totally agree.

00:27:39.357 --> 00:27:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's when people
feel their most vulnerable.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.700 align:middle line:90%
They know they've screwed up.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.410 align:middle line:84%
They're hoping not
to get really busted

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:46.840 align:middle line:90%
on it because they feel bad.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.180 align:middle line:84%
But, in fact, I have
always found people

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.420 align:middle line:84%
to be at their most beautiful
and most lovable when

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.370 align:middle line:84%
those vulnerabilities
come to the surface.

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And you say, god, I
can't believe I did that.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Right.

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I'm sorry, you know.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.333 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Well, think about that.

00:27:59.333 --> 00:28:01.330 align:middle line:84%
The guilt is generally
a shock to the ego.

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's ego, yeah.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: So the
ego takes a, boom,

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and then it drops, and then
you get the vulnerability.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.780 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is where you get
a thing when you're suffering

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.970 align:middle line:90%
that it is an opportunity.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:16.840 align:middle line:90%
A doorway opens.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.098 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:28:18.098 --> 00:28:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things you
wrote about in the book

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.888 align:middle line:84%
is, you know, everybody
likes to believe

00:28:22.888 --> 00:28:24.430 align:middle line:84%
that if they could
just kind of order

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:27.430 align:middle line:84%
their life around their
wishes and their dreams,

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:30.670 align:middle line:84%
everything would be perfect
if at all just supported them

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and life just
supported their dreams.

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:35.980 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that is not
true, so let's talk about that.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.273 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yeah, I mean it's--

00:28:37.273 --> 00:28:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: 'Cause this goes into
conflict a little bit with just

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:41.590 align:middle line:90%
believe it, and it will happen.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And just because you
wish it and dream

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:47.530 align:middle line:84%
it does not mean that that
is going to be your life

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and it's even the best
path for your life.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: The thing is, even
if you did get everything you

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:56.740 align:middle line:84%
wanted just like that, your
suffering would not end.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.890 align:middle line:10%
'Cause you look at all the
people who have it all--

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:02.960 align:middle line:10%
lots of money, fame, the whole
bit-- and they commit suicide.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.060 align:middle line:10%
Or for myself, you know, I
thought I had a couple dreams.

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.552 align:middle line:90%
One was to make a lot of money.

00:29:08.552 --> 00:29:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, I did that with
software companies.

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And really to make a film,
a spiritual thing that would

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:16.160 align:middle line:90%
transform, and I did that.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And so those were really
my two big things.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I figured, OK,
now I'm, you know, no.

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I've done it.

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Well, then someone
cuts you off on the freeway.

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:28.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, you see
something in the news.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.740 align:middle line:90%
Something bad happens.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean, then it doesn't end.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:36.370 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that by
getting everything I want,

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:39.550 align:middle line:84%
my life will be perfect
is just an illusion.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And that illusion drives
people to work like crazy to,

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.460 align:middle line:84%
you know, all the stuff
that people do in order

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:55.490 align:middle line:84%
to get everything thinking that
that's going to be nirvana.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:56.392 align:middle line:90%
And it ain't.

00:29:56.392 --> 00:29:57.600 align:middle line:90%
That's not how you get there.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because our being
is actually seeking growth.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Our being is growth.

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's really--
and all the stuff

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.220 align:middle line:84%
that you want, again,
that's external.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.200 align:middle line:90%
That's in the world of the ego.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:16.580 align:middle line:84%
But really, the joy that you
get is on the soul level.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.440 align:middle line:90%
It's that inner part of you.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And I've been thinking
a lot about what--

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.080 align:middle line:84%
since I wrote this book--
what part of you suffers?

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.970 align:middle line:90%
What part of you suffers?

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you start
doing that, there

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:37.730 align:middle line:84%
was the guy, Mohana
Maharshi, Ramana Maharshi.

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yeah.

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.022 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, I love him, yes.

00:30:40.022 --> 00:30:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Yeah, and his thing
was say just, who am I?

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.120 align:middle line:90%
You just meditate.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.030 align:middle line:90%
You go, who am I?

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:45.350 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:46.730 align:middle line:90%
And that'll take you there.

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, I started realizing if
you just say, who is suffering?

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.460 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little easier
to get there because--

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:55.775 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --than who am I.

00:30:55.775 --> 00:30:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Yeah, because
that's a little nebulous.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.970 align:middle line:84%
But what is it, the part
of you that is suffering?

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:03.230 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's kind of--

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:06.310 align:middle line:90%
well, it's the-- uh, well, uh--

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:10.030 align:middle line:90%


00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:11.560 align:middle line:90%
It's an interesting question.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It has to be an
incongruency between what

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:16.080 align:middle line:90%
the soul desires.

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.580 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into desire,
common desire in the moment.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:22.800 align:middle line:84%
But what the soul is desiring
to have as this experience

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and growth and learning
in a lifetime as opposed

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:29.590 align:middle line:84%
to what the lower mind or
personality or conscious mind

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:31.540 align:middle line:90%
is up to in these parts.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And with, certainly, I
think, the vast majority

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:37.240 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, unless
you're really

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.120 align:middle line:84%
effective at deep
meditation are not

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.453 align:middle line:84%
in communication
consciously with each other.

00:31:42.453 --> 00:31:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So we just kind of throw
spaghetti against the wall.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Say, hmm, bring in some
stuff from other lifetimes.

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Like, hey, I'm
good at the piano.

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:49.993 align:middle line:90%
I think I'll be a pianist.

00:31:49.993 --> 00:31:51.010 align:middle line:90%
And you don't know it.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:52.343 align:middle line:90%
You just want to play the piano.

00:31:52.343 --> 00:31:54.880 align:middle line:84%
But maybe that's not the
road that you're supposed

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.140 align:middle line:90%
to travel in this lifetime.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.390 align:middle line:84%
You just kind of can't help
yourself 'cause it's easy.

00:31:58.390 --> 00:31:59.680 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's praising you.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.940 align:middle line:90%
So you get down that path.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:03.720 align:middle line:90%
And somehow, you're sinking.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not feeding you.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.023 align:middle line:90%
You're not growing.

00:32:06.023 --> 00:32:07.690 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, I think
people are following

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:11.110 align:middle line:84%
these kind of
subconscious desires

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.820 align:middle line:84%
all the time without
understanding

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:17.150 align:middle line:84%
that's not the soul's desire
for expression in that lifetime.

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
complex and deep subject.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And talk about
that a bit 'cause I

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.750 align:middle line:84%
think that is where
suffering happens.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Well, what I
came to is that suffering

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.655 align:middle line:90%
is related to the soul.

00:32:28.655 --> 00:32:29.455 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:32:29.455 --> 00:32:31.138 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: So it's like when you--

00:32:31.138 --> 00:32:33.430 align:middle line:84%
'cause often, you know, I
think, well, where's my soul?

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:34.120 align:middle line:90%
I want to touch my soul.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.010 align:middle line:90%
It's like my personality.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:35.810 align:middle line:90%
It's my ego.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And [MUMBLES],, you go
through all that stuff.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting when you're
suffering about something,

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.170 align:middle line:90%
it really takes you internal.

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:45.435 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: And that's
why, you know,

00:32:45.435 --> 00:32:46.810 align:middle line:84%
when I started
writing this book,

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:48.920 align:middle line:84%
I kind of wrote it as a satire
of self-help books, really.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: But once I got into
it, I realized, oh, my god, it's

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:55.300 align:middle line:90%
the one thing we all experience.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And all this other stuff
out there, it kind of

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:03.160 align:middle line:84%
ends up relating to, in a
very internal state, how

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.170 align:middle line:90%
you're suffering.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And no one is really talking
about it as such, so.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.750 align:middle line:84%
People are not talking
about it as such,

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.500 align:middle line:90%
and that's something I notice.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Even what we talked about at the
beginning of the show, people

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.680 align:middle line:84%
kind of guiltily saying, I
know I shouldn't say this,

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.560 align:middle line:84%
but I'm kind of
liking this, where

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:27.220 align:middle line:84%
this quiet of the COVID
period of history, right?

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:30.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I'm
just slowing down.

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:31.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm walking.

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:32.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:33.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm drawing again.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing the things I love.

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually
living in closer harmony

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.000 align:middle line:84%
because everything
ground to a stop.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Consumption ground to a stop,
except for food and such,

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.400 align:middle line:90%
you know, habitual things.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:49.210 align:middle line:84%
That they're actually having
a moment to listen to the wh--

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:53.205 align:middle line:84%
I call it just the whisperings
from our soul into our being,

00:33:53.205 --> 00:33:54.005 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:33:54.005 --> 00:33:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Yep, that's
what a retreat does.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why you go on a
retreat is so you can--

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:02.260 align:middle line:84%
you get rid of all
that stuff out there,

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.800 align:middle line:90%
and you go internally.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we're all doing.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So if suffering's
happening from a soul level,

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, which it has to
be because it is deep.

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:16.239 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you know, it'd
be something that can pass.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:18.873 align:middle line:84%
You could put some bubble gum
on it, and it would be OK.

00:34:18.873 --> 00:34:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the
other end of it,

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:22.449 align:middle line:84%
the repository of
everything that's been,

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:24.909 align:middle line:84%
everything that's ever
been and ever hurt us

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:28.310 align:middle line:84%
and made us happy in
the subconscious mind.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Because I personally
find it fascinating

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:35.320 align:middle line:84%
how the soul, the conscious
mind, and the subconscious

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.210 align:middle line:84%
work together or don't work
together in a lot of cases.

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:42.969 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Well, I mean,
that's part of the--

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:45.159 align:middle line:84%
again, back to self
discovery, that's

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:47.449 align:middle line:84%
part of the cleaning
process to align those

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:50.230 align:middle line:84%
and once those are
better aligned.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:53.380 align:middle line:84%
There's one thing I want to
bring up that relates to this.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And I know that a
lot of the interviews

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and stuff you talk about here
is scientifically oriented.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And people say, OK, what's
the cause of suffering?

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:06.970 align:middle line:84%
In all this stuff I've done, the
thing that I found was the five

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:08.550 align:middle line:84%
clichés Have you
heard about these?

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: The five
clichés are from Vedanta.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: And it
says the first one

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.160 align:middle line:84%
is that all suffering is
caused by the misapprehension

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.705 align:middle line:90%
of the nature of reality.

00:35:19.705 --> 00:35:20.665 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:35:20.665 --> 00:35:21.790 align:middle line:90%
That's very mental, though.

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: I know.

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:24.777 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: The second
one is all suffering

00:35:24.777 --> 00:35:28.960 align:middle line:84%
is caused by attachment
to the transitory.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Next one is-- it goes on.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.047 align:middle line:84%
The last one is all
suffering is caused by the--

00:35:35.047 --> 00:35:36.755 align:middle line:84%
suffering is caused
by the fear of death.

00:35:36.755 --> 00:35:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: But all the other
ones, two through five,

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:42.920 align:middle line:90%
are contained in the first one.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:43.720 align:middle line:90%
Even the--

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.053 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The misapprehension
of the nature of reality.

00:35:46.053 --> 00:35:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: So if in reality, one
never dies, you only transform,

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:54.190 align:middle line:84%
then your fear of
death is because you're

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:57.130 align:middle line:90%
misapprehending reality, right?

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:59.350 align:middle line:90%
So that one thing--

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and so the suffering, if you
given that, suffering, then,

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:06.270 align:middle line:84%
is just a correction to get us
perceiving reality properly.

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I'm with you.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:08.562 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I hear what you're saying.

00:36:08.562 --> 00:36:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: So that's really--
it's like the part you align to.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly
enough, when you

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:18.130 align:middle line:84%
talk to people about
near-death experiences,

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:22.070 align:middle line:84%
where they've seen the greater
reality, when they come back,

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.760 align:middle line:84%
they pretty much don't
have a fear of death.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.660 align:middle line:84%
They completely change,
and their suffering

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.310 align:middle line:90%
goes, zrrr, way down.

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just
eliminating that one.

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.600 align:middle line:84%
The nature of reality
is that we're, you

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.480 align:middle line:90%
know, particles of light.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.570 align:middle line:90%
We're a never-ending being.

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that sounds great.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.582 align:middle line:84%
But if you haven't
experienced it, you know,

00:36:45.582 --> 00:36:47.290 align:middle line:84%
people have a hard
time handling that one

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:49.810 align:middle line:84%
because they see someone's
dead body and all the suffering

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:53.290 align:middle line:84%
of the process of dying and,
you know, sudden traumatic death

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:57.070 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, which it lays
down such a traumatic imprint

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:58.300 align:middle line:90%
in the subconscious.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.780 align:middle line:84%
To say nothing of the fact that
if one buys into the notion

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.810 align:middle line:84%
that life is cyclical,
cycles of incarnations,

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.610 align:middle line:84%
that we have within
our subconscious

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:11.500 align:middle line:84%
all the myriad of ways one
can die imprinted right on us,

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.780 align:middle line:84%
so we know that part of
the pain and suffering.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what holds people
down into that fear of death.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Well, it is.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And also, I mean, just
within this one lifetime,

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:23.230 align:middle line:84%
you're like, well,
what happens when

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:24.525 align:middle line:90%
I don't have my hands anymore?

00:37:24.525 --> 00:37:25.325 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:37:25.325 --> 00:37:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: So, you know,
it's a big thing.

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:31.000 align:middle line:84%
But again, when the people
of the NDEs, all of that

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.585 align:middle line:84%
goes away because they have a
deeper perception of reality.

00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:35.733 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:35.733 --> 00:37:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have any--
what, number two attachment

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:38.700 align:middle line:90%
to the transitory.

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Right, 'cause you
know it's all transitory,

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and you're not, that the
you, the soul, the spirit,

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:48.573 align:middle line:84%
whatever, that's the only
thing that's not transitory.

00:37:48.573 --> 00:37:49.490 align:middle line:90%
So hang out with that.

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:54.686 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
virtue in suffering then.

00:37:54.686 --> 00:37:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: The virtue in it?

00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Some people say,
oh, there's great virtue

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:58.440 align:middle line:90%
in suffering.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.990 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at it
from this perspective,

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:06.500 align:middle line:84%
the virtue can be in ultimately
discovering that highest

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.770 align:middle line:84%
essence of the nature of reality
and connect with the highest

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:12.680 align:middle line:84%
essence of self, try to
live in companionship

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.070 align:middle line:84%
with its desires of expression
for this incarnation.

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Then any suffering can almost
be a virtue, not something

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:21.215 align:middle line:90%
to cling to but--

00:38:21.215 --> 00:38:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: It's something that--

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and again, this is coming up
with a way, a strategy or a way

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:30.910 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
look at what befalls you.

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: So but it gets
back to that thing.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:38.450 align:middle line:90%
It's like a correction.

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Like if you feel--

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.070 align:middle line:84%
a good example is guilt. You did
something horrible to someone.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:45.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, and then
you're saying, OK,

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I feel bad because
that was not reality.

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go
knit it back together.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:57.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, we talk
about the big one, OK,

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.880 align:middle line:90%
the Eastern traditions, right?

00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yep.

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Desire is at
the root of all suffering--

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:03.460 align:middle line:90%
that statement.

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:04.668 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yeah, they say that.

00:39:04.668 --> 00:39:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I totally disagree
with that, by the way,

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.530 align:middle line:90%
completely disagree.

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:11.930 align:middle line:84%
But it depends on the
quality of the desire.

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:13.820 align:middle line:84%
If you're desiring
to have another drink

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:15.620 align:middle line:84%
'cause you're also
schized out, you know,

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.830 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to cope with
life and cover your suffering,

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:20.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
that kind of desire.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:24.440 align:middle line:84%
But that subtle kind of desire
that's whispering through from

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:28.340 align:middle line:84%
the soul and beckoning you
forward into something--

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:33.680 align:middle line:84%
that kind of desire, I don't
think you can really live--

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you can live
an effective life and a life

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:39.770 align:middle line:84%
that's not just full of
suffering without that desire,

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:43.050 align:middle line:84%
that thing you came to do
to express in the world.

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yeah.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:46.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a lot of
ways that some of the stuff--

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.837 align:middle line:84%
you know, another one's
the non-attachment.

00:39:48.837 --> 00:39:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, non-attachment.

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: You have people who
say, oh, non-attachment's

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:53.220 align:middle line:90%
a thing.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And I've met people who
are so non-attached,

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.630 align:middle line:84%
they don't care about
anything or anybody.

00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:00.543 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind of
miserable people, really.

00:40:00.543 --> 00:40:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that can kind
of lead to narcissism, too.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Oh, yeah.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so all these things, you
sort of have to look at it.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:11.802 align:middle line:84%
The desire, I mean, if
you really have no desire,

00:40:11.802 --> 00:40:13.510 align:middle line:84%
I would have never
made "What the Bleep?"

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:16.570 align:middle line:84%
That was part of
your life purpose.

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:18.540 align:middle line:90%
Your soul was speaking to you.

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.283 align:middle line:90%
And you made a beautiful film.

00:40:20.283 --> 00:40:21.700 align:middle line:84%
The people you
needed came to you.

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:22.790 align:middle line:90%
The messages came.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yeah.

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:25.780 align:middle line:90%
The ego was lucky, too.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
the ego, of course.

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:29.560 align:middle line:84%
A good ego can keep the
project moving forward.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.430 align:middle line:84%
A strong sense of self can keep
things moving forward also.

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:34.697 align:middle line:90%
There's a place for it.

00:40:34.697 --> 00:40:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: You just
can't-- just gotta--

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Will.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.957 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: You gotta
keep a little, yeah.

00:40:38.957 --> 00:40:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, you
can call it will, also.

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:43.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ego's even a
misunderstood word.

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:44.800 align:middle line:84%
But one thing I
never asked you here

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.750 align:middle line:84%
is what was the
impetus speaking to you

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:54.510 align:middle line:84%
that created the desire to
create that film to begin with?

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: There was a couple.

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:58.550 align:middle line:84%
One, and when I was
growing up, I had always

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:00.170 align:middle line:90%
wanted to make movies.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:03.380 align:middle line:84%
But then I went off into
science, so that was it.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Number two, I had a
chip on my shoulder.

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:10.430 align:middle line:84%
I had been in the spiritual
practice for 20 years

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:12.410 align:middle line:90%
and had spiritual teachers.

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And all during that
time, it was if people

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.740 align:middle line:84%
knew you were meditating and
the spiritual thing, it was very

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.120 align:middle line:90%
looked down upon.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Jim Jones, you going
to drink the Kool-Aid?

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.173 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was people--

00:41:24.173 --> 00:41:26.840 align:middle line:84%
and I had a chip on my shoulder,
because after 20 years of doing

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.690 align:middle line:84%
this and the people I
knew that I did this with,

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:31.900 align:middle line:84%
these were not a
bunch of flake balls.

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.100 align:middle line:84%
They were people who
were reading and studying

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and examining and
looking into what--

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:37.550 align:middle line:90%
asking questions.

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean physicists as
a lot tend to do more of that

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:42.075 align:middle line:90%
than other scientists as well.

00:41:42.075 --> 00:41:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: They tend to do that.

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.530 align:middle line:84%
But anyone in the
spiritual field--

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:48.680 align:middle line:84%
whether, you know, the Buddha
or whatever, they're all--

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:51.020 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't this flaky thing.

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I had chip
on my shoulder.

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, you know, I'm tired
of being a second-class citizen.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put this movie out,
and I'm going to use science.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:41:59.105 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm
going to prove it.

00:41:59.105 --> 00:42:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: And I'm going to
show you guys that this is

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:03.080 align:middle line:90%
a legitimate--

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.340 align:middle line:90%
whether you agree or not--

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:07.100 align:middle line:84%
this is a legitimate
area of study

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.470 align:middle line:90%
as much as anything else is.

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:10.370 align:middle line:90%
So I don't want to hear it.

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So that was another
reason to do it.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you may say
chip on your shoulder or ego.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.470 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it was just
a very strong expression,

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:21.170 align:middle line:84%
in my-- this is just my
big fat opinion here--

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:23.630 align:middle line:84%
that your soul was speaking
through to you, do this thing.

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Make it so other people can
also feel safe and validated

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:29.780 align:middle line:84%
in their own practice, and
spread the word, so to speak.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Well, that was
the third reason, actually.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.210 align:middle line:84%
That I started-- and when
I started doing this,

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:37.640 align:middle line:84%
I started getting
this inner sense

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.110 align:middle line:84%
that there were
millions of people

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:41.450 align:middle line:90%
out there who were pulling it.

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:43.275 align:middle line:90%
They wanted the information.

00:42:43.275 --> 00:42:44.650 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
what they want--

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:48.680 align:middle line:84%
they were pulling it, and it
was a very strong psychic pull.

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And I usually don't
get stuff like that.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:53.820 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that it was
such a strong thing,

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.895 align:middle line:90%
and I'm like, OK, here we go.

00:42:55.895 --> 00:42:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm being spoken
to by me, me, the big me.

00:42:58.700 --> 00:42:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yeah.

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:04.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, going back from
that we're going to tail

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.800 align:middle line:84%
back a bit into some of the
elements of hopelessness.

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Right now, there will be people
over the next year or two

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.380 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
start experiencing

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.970 align:middle line:84%
a sense of hopelessness because
maybe their career path has

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:15.770 align:middle line:90%
gone away.

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:17.330 align:middle line:90%
Their jobs have been eliminated.

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:18.997 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're going
to lose their house,

00:43:18.997 --> 00:43:21.230 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's going to be
foreclosed on by the bank,

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and hopelessness
start setting in.

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:26.051 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
hopelessness for a moment.

00:43:26.051 --> 00:43:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Well, that's--
boy, that's suffering.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.560 align:middle line:84%
What do you do when you're
faced with those situations?

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.246 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:43:35.246 --> 00:43:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You really need
to listen to the soul then.

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:40.425 align:middle line:90%
We all chose to incarnate now.

00:43:40.425 --> 00:43:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: I mean, this is where
you just really have to go in--

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.135 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the thing is I go
back to the core values.

00:43:47.135 --> 00:43:47.935 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:43:47.935 --> 00:43:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: You go back to
what is important to you.

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, in
our modern society,

00:43:54.760 --> 00:44:00.160 align:middle line:84%
certain core values are not
necessarily well thought of.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.650 align:middle line:90%
Example would be honesty.

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:06.972 align:middle line:84%
Example would be living one's
word, a certain sense of--

00:44:06.972 --> 00:44:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The great virtues.

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: --ethics.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, the virtues really
aren't talked about ever

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:13.030 align:middle line:90%
in our society.

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:14.072 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Never anymore.

00:44:14.072 --> 00:44:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: It's not like these
ideals that you live up to,

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:20.200 align:middle line:84%
and it's what makes
you humanity noble

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:23.290 align:middle line:84%
or a person noble
and great, that those

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:24.310 align:middle line:90%
are important things.

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:25.970 align:middle line:90%
They're never mentioned anymore.

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Generosity, courage,
as you say, truthfulness.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: All that stuff.

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:35.440 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend who put
together an ethics program

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.770 align:middle line:90%
at University of Santa Barbara.

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:37.570 align:middle line:90%
And he did it.

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:40.570 align:middle line:90%
He was a Ex-CEO of Coca-Cola.

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said when he
went to business school,

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:44.680 align:middle line:90%
they took an ethics class.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:47.237 align:middle line:84%
And ethics was basically how
to keep from getting a lawsuit.

00:44:47.237 --> 00:44:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, jeez.

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: That was all
they talked about.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.833 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that's
a narrow definition.

00:44:50.833 --> 00:44:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Whoa!

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:54.130 align:middle line:90%
But that was considered ethics.

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea that
ethics, and it's something

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.890 align:middle line:90%
that is admired in our society.

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:02.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we admire the
wealthy, the billionaires.

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:04.720 align:middle line:90%
We admire the athletes.

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:09.370 align:middle line:84%
We admire, whichever
political side you're on,

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:11.230 align:middle line:90%
we admire those folks.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:19.410 align:middle line:84%
But do we actually admire
the qualities, these ideals?

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is just
not talked about.

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I couldn't
agree with you more.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:24.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And to start really
stepping back and looking

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:29.670 align:middle line:84%
at where we fall when
it comes to these very

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:33.600 align:middle line:84%
essential elements of life,
ways of engaging with life.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.738 align:middle line:84%
Are we being truthful to
ourselves and others, you know?

00:45:36.738 --> 00:45:38.280 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
simple one right now,

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:42.180 align:middle line:84%
because we seem to have become
untethered, generally speaking,

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.440 align:middle line:90%
from the truth.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And I did the--
for a good reason.

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the only
place to go, which

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be doing
in another interview,

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:55.320 align:middle line:84%
to ascertain how we can connect
with that truth in ourselves,

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.810 align:middle line:84%
the only place to go is to
that higher place in self,

00:45:57.810 --> 00:46:02.320 align:middle line:84%
because externally, it's all
opinion, it's all conjecture,

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.950 align:middle line:84%
it's all belief
around us right now.

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yes.

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I interviewed
a man named Carl Calleman

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:11.070 align:middle line:84%
recently talking
about the Mayan--

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:13.950 align:middle line:84%
the plumed serpent, which is
the waves of consciousness,

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:16.440 align:middle line:84%
up and down, up and down,
and talking about what

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.900 align:middle line:84%
happens when you're
in a mini decline

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:20.310 align:middle line:90%
in a state of consciousness.

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:22.860 align:middle line:84%
It still allows you
access to the higher

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:25.830 align:middle line:84%
states of conscious if
you choose to go there

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:29.160 align:middle line:84%
through the lens of the virtues
and connecting with the soul.

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.260 align:middle line:84%
But in mass, what that
consciousness looks

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.750 align:middle line:84%
like at the moment
is a descending path

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:36.220 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness in
the mind of cosmology.

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:38.415 align:middle line:84%
And it when it
reaches this point,

00:46:38.415 --> 00:46:40.860 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that
happens, he was saying,

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:46.380 align:middle line:84%
is that we have
suspicion, mistrust, fear.

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And that starts giving way
to the notion of conspiracy--

00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:51.510 align:middle line:90%
who's against who?

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:52.650 align:middle line:90%
Who's against all of us?

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:54.060 align:middle line:90%
You know, what's going on?

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Because you can sense
something's not right

00:46:56.370 --> 00:47:00.720 align:middle line:84%
or since you're not ascertaining
the whole truth, and so

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.400 align:middle line:84%
conspiratorial
thinking takes hold,

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.210 align:middle line:90%
which we have on all sides.

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:05.940 align:middle line:90%
It's rampant right now.

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And what happens,
he said, is when

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.260 align:middle line:84%
it becomes collective
in nature is

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:13.852 align:middle line:84%
when cultures and
civilizations ultimately fall.

00:47:13.852 --> 00:47:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Hear that?

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Hear that everyone?

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When we have given
way to conspiratorial thinking

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:22.950 align:middle line:84%
rather than consolidating,
going inside,

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and perpetually trying to
stay ordered toward essential

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:30.310 align:middle line:84%
truths, which we're not doing
at the moment very well at all.

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: I know.

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:31.910 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And all these
conspir-- you can't--

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:38.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're crazy,
these conspiracies

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:39.280 align:middle line:90%
that they come up with.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.483 align:middle line:84%
And so the problem is
that because people--

00:47:42.483 --> 00:47:44.400 align:middle line:84%
we talked about this
earlier-- a lot of people

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:47.850 align:middle line:84%
aren't taking the time to read
books or read long articles

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:49.190 align:middle line:90%
or research anymore.

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:51.280 align:middle line:84%
You go to your
favorite, you know,

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:55.140 align:middle line:84%
blog source or your favorite
TV show host or whatever.

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:56.520 align:middle line:90%
They'll throw out something.

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.373 align:middle line:84%
That's all entertainment,
infotainment.

00:47:59.373 --> 00:48:00.540 align:middle line:90%
They'll throw out something.

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:03.370 align:middle line:84%
You're hearing this tiny sliver
of it and not understanding,

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:06.300 align:middle line:84%
yeah, there may be some deeper
truth to that little part,

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.460 align:middle line:84%
but you have been
given no background.

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've kind of
taken it up as your cause

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:12.360 align:middle line:90%
with no information behind it.

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And now, you and your family
are hating on each other

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:17.516 align:middle line:84%
because they heard something
else from their talk show host.

00:48:17.516 --> 00:48:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just like, it's
absolutely insane right now.

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Oh, yeah.

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:23.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, hey, look at this table.

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:24.750 align:middle line:90%
This is the Earth.

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:26.200 align:middle line:90%
It's flat.

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:27.450 align:middle line:90%
Have you read that?

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
oh, yeah, I have.

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yeah, it's on YouTube.

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:30.293 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:48:30.293 --> 00:48:31.880 align:middle line:90%
I heard it, too.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just-- so
I think what I'm

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:38.040 align:middle line:84%
trying to say here is
that in this descending

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.860 align:middle line:84%
phase of this little mini
cycle of consciousness,

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.620 align:middle line:84%
that it's a natural extension
of losing your bearings as you

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:47.572 align:middle line:84%
become confused and
mistrustful and conspiratorial.

00:48:47.572 --> 00:48:49.280 align:middle line:84%
But now, that's not
a good place to stay.

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.905 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: It's not a
good place to stay,

00:48:50.905 --> 00:48:52.590 align:middle line:90%
but then you hit the bottom.

00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And then it gets so
bad, you suffer so much,

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:58.260 align:middle line:84%
that then you're driven
back to the internal

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:00.813 align:middle line:84%
and what's really important,
what's really noble.

00:49:00.813 --> 00:49:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you start-- and
you see these cycles.

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:04.530 align:middle line:90%
It's always the pendulum.

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And so right now, I
mean, really, there

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:11.730 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of people, when
Obama was elected president,

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:13.050 align:middle line:90%
everyone was very hopeful.

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.460 align:middle line:90%
They were very, very hopeful.

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like,
oh, this is great.

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's swung
the other way.

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:20.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, now we have this division.

00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:24.180 align:middle line:84%
You know they start calling this
instead of the USA, the DSA--

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.600 align:middle line:90%
the Divided States of America.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah, truly is.

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: And that,
again, is when

00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:31.078 align:middle line:84%
you talk about these cycles,
that's something that happens.

00:49:31.078 --> 00:49:33.480 align:middle line:84%
It just gets-- you get
all this separation.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.745 align:middle line:90%
It gets to the max.

00:49:34.745 --> 00:49:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
people start

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:38.610 align:middle line:84%
going, like, oh, my
god, this separation.

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:39.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's crazy.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:43.223 align:middle line:90%
We're 98% the same.

00:49:43.223 --> 00:49:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Why are we so divided?

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We want
the same things.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: We want
the same things.

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Almost all
humans want the same things.

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:52.810 align:middle line:84%
It's just choosing to latch on
to different paths of getting

00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:55.480 align:middle line:84%
there which is creating
the separation.

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, I interviewed someone
who was a former KGB spy,

00:49:58.630 --> 00:50:01.000 align:middle line:84%
so his mind was
trained early on,

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.040 align:middle line:84%
and he had a natural
facility for kind

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.350 align:middle line:84%
of looking behind things,
looking at dynamics

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:07.210 align:middle line:90%
that aren't obvious to people.

00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:09.790 align:middle line:84%
I've asked him to do an analysis
of where we are right now,

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:12.040 align:middle line:84%
which he's going to share
with me in a couple of days.

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:15.670 align:middle line:84%
He said that's a big one, but
I will do it 'cause he said,

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I was not wired to
do social commentary.

00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:20.350 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
he did write back to me

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:23.410 align:middle line:84%
in a recent email
exchange, he said

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:28.180 align:middle line:84%
with the advent of the internet,
where everyone's anonymous,

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:30.130 align:middle line:84%
anything can be
anonymous, people even

00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:35.380 align:middle line:84%
call themselves anonymous,
we've lost the battle for truth.

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:37.240 align:middle line:90%
And now, it's out of the barn.

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:38.710 align:middle line:90%
There's no getting it back.

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:41.830 align:middle line:84%
There's nowhere to go but this
place you're talking about,

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:45.290 align:middle line:84%
this consolidation
inside ourselves

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:47.680 align:middle line:84%
to listening to that, what
is our higher purpose?

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.360 align:middle line:90%
And I want to get to that, too.

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
your Sufferometer--

00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:52.245 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Ah!

00:50:52.245 --> 00:50:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --'cause
that's in the book.

00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Talk about your
Sufferometer for a moment.

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And then go into
trying to engage

00:50:58.030 --> 00:51:00.070 align:middle line:84%
with how you really
know what you're here

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:01.630 align:middle line:90%
to do and learn right now.

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Because we all chose to be here
in this game together right now

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:04.490 align:middle line:90%
embodied.

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Mm-hmm, OK.

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so there's
something we're all trying

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:09.710 align:middle line:90%
to learn collectively as well.

00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about your
Sufferometer for a moment.

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Sufferometer--
I brought one.

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:14.540 align:middle line:84%
I should have brought
it to the thing.

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:15.457 align:middle line:90%
I brought my very own.

00:51:15.457 --> 00:51:17.210 align:middle line:90%
I took it off the refrigerator.

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:18.580 align:middle line:90%
So I wrote this chapter.

00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:21.130 align:middle line:84%
I called it the
Pseudoscience of Suffering.

00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of come up
with graphs and charts

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and these sort of
things and cycles,

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.390 align:middle line:90%
and I nerd out a bit on that.

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the
chapter, I go, well,

00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:31.600 align:middle line:84%
even a pseudoscience
needs a metric.

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.420 align:middle line:90%
So my metric is a Sufferometer.

00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it's a little
home arts and crafts project.

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:39.430 align:middle line:90%
You make these Sufferometers.

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:42.740 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, there's
a dial from 0 to 100

00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:44.920 align:middle line:84%
where you say how much
are you suffering?

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.520 align:middle line:90%
So I come up with this thing.

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.010 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's kind of funny.

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:49.150 align:middle line:90%
You laugh.

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:51.260 align:middle line:90%
It keeps it light and whatnot.

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:54.526 align:middle line:90%
And then at one point, I--

00:51:54.526 --> 00:51:57.400 align:middle line:84%
it's actually kind of funny,
talk about a small circle--

00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:02.320 align:middle line:84%
one day, I was
negotiating here with Gaia

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.962 align:middle line:90%
about selling "Bleep."

00:52:03.962 --> 00:52:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And there was some of
this and there was some--

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and it just didn't look
like it was going to happen,

00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:08.800 align:middle line:90%
or maybe it was.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was just
whenever you do a deal,

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.550 align:middle line:84%
that's the way it
goes, you know.

00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:15.512 align:middle line:84%
So we're going this,
and I'm like, uh,

00:52:15.512 --> 00:52:18.520 align:middle line:90%
and it was really bugging me.

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, I'm just going to
go to the Sufferometer on this.

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:25.180 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm suffering at about--

00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:28.090 align:middle line:84%
I put it up at about a
70, you know, like this.

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And there's other parts
of the Sufferometer

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.300 align:middle line:90%
that you sort of do.

00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:34.600 align:middle line:84%
But I did these things, and
I started looking at it.

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And I started
thinking, well, I'm

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.810 align:middle line:84%
suffering because
I'm in the future.

00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's a time
slider at the bottom.

00:52:40.570 --> 00:52:43.690 align:middle line:84%
You say, is your suffering in
the past, present, or future.

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:45.310 align:middle line:84%
So my suffering
was in the future

00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:47.060 align:middle line:90%
'cause I was in the future.

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So there's a wisdom
wheel where you

00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:52.600 align:middle line:84%
move it to say how you're going
to get out of the suffering.

00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.680 align:middle line:90%
I moved it to time.

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.630 align:middle line:90%
I was going to get in the now.

00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So I, mm, OK, I'm going
to not think about that.

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:01.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go out
and deadhead flowers.

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So I went out and
deadheaded flowers.

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And after about 20
minutes, my Sufferometer,

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:08.370 align:middle line:90%
it was down to 10.

00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:09.600 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh, my god.

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.630 align:middle line:90%
It actually works.

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:14.070 align:middle line:84%
So the idea with this thing,
even though it's a crazy idea,

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:17.040 align:middle line:84%
if every day you have to say
how much you're suffering,

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.080 align:middle line:84%
you have to put a
number on it, it

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:22.860 align:middle line:84%
does the thing of taking it out
of this gorilla in the room,

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:24.840 align:middle line:90%
kind of hidden, not dealt with.

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying this is
how much I'm suffering?

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, when I would do
it, I'd say oh, I'm about 60.

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm, like, 60.

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Really?

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: You're suffering
this much on that?

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I would just go,
like, that's ridiculous.

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Bzzz.

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Then I would just stop
because, again, it was a habit.

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And once I realized
that-- so the crazy idea

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:50.760 align:middle line:84%
of a Sufferometer actually
works, because, again, you're

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.730 align:middle line:84%
externalizing an internal
state so you can look at it

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:58.652 align:middle line:84%
and go, oh, with the
conscious mind, oh.

00:53:58.652 --> 00:54:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
your choice on how

00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:01.060 align:middle line:90%
you're going to deal with it.

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:01.760 align:middle line:90%
That's the Sufferometer.

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I love it.

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:03.140 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:03.580 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And you know I was
thinking, wouldn't it

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.940 align:middle line:84%
be great if parents
gave each of their kids

00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:12.530 align:middle line:84%
a little Sufferometer, like,
how mad or how sad are you?

00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:14.450 align:middle line:84%
So that people
started connecting

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:17.780 align:middle line:84%
with their authentic feelings
and the ability and freedom

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:20.600 align:middle line:84%
to express them from
a very early age.

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:23.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, you by
three, how sad are you?

00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:25.820 align:middle line:84%
This many or this
many, you know?

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think it would
be a beautiful thing

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.030 align:middle line:90%
to introduce into a family.

00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Have your family's
Sufferometer or sad chart.

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Well, what you do
you, what my wife and I do,

00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:37.310 align:middle line:84%
put them on the
refrigerator, right?

00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:39.102 align:middle line:84%
So you come down in
the morning, and if you

00:54:39.102 --> 00:54:41.240 align:middle line:84%
look at your spouses,
and it's up at around 95,

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.850 align:middle line:84%
it's like, I don't think
I'm going to bring up

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:46.320 align:middle line:90%
this new car I want to buy.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.740 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm just going to
like-- but if it's down to 3.

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:50.823 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Especially since
she just lost her job.

00:54:50.823 --> 00:54:53.160 align:middle line:90%


00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: So anyway, it's--

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:56.990 align:middle line:84%
so yeah, if you had
a family, everyone

00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:58.838 align:middle line:84%
would have their own
little Sufferometer.

00:54:58.838 --> 00:54:59.880 align:middle line:90%
You just kind of look it.

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.047 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, it would
be a way to start becoming

00:55:02.047 --> 00:55:04.715 align:middle line:84%
emotionally honest with each
other from a very early age.

00:55:04.715 --> 00:55:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And that could actually
be a beautiful thing,

00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:08.990 align:middle line:84%
because then that garbage
doesn't have to all build up

00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:12.857 align:middle line:84%
in the subconscious to be dealt
with at a later time, you know?

00:55:12.857 --> 00:55:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: Of course, you're going
to give it to some clever kid

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:18.643 align:middle line:84%
at age 9 who's going
to say, it's up at 95

00:55:18.643 --> 00:55:20.560 align:middle line:84%
because I have to do
this stupid Sufferometer.

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:21.360 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm suffering about.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Of course, too
clever for your own britches.

00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:25.817 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yeah, too clever.

00:55:25.817 --> 00:55:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I wanted to
talk about your wife.

00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:28.450 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned this.

00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Your wife's name means
"of the sorrows."

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Deirdre.

00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Deirdre.

00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Deirdre.

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:35.750 align:middle line:90%
Deidre of the Sorrows.

00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So she has a name
that is kind of weighted with

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:39.380 align:middle line:90%
suffering.

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Well, her--

00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:46.430 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you, the
book really came about--

00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:49.760 align:middle line:84%
one day, I was walking
through the living room,

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.070 align:middle line:90%
and she's laying on the couch.

00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Her back is out and
in little lot of pain.

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.838 align:middle line:84%
I said, honey, what
do you want to do?

00:55:55.838 --> 00:55:57.005 align:middle line:90%
And she didn't say anything.

00:55:57.005 --> 00:55:57.805 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:55:57.805 --> 00:56:01.700 align:middle line:84%
She goes, I just want
to lay here and suffer.

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:02.570 align:middle line:90%
And I just stop.

00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:04.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm like what?

00:56:04.090 --> 00:56:05.030 align:middle line:90%
No one says, I said--

00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.210 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Not
your go-to emotion.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: She goes, yes, I'm
perfecting my suffering.

00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And I started to laugh,
just the way she said it.

00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I said
the infamous line,

00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:16.310 align:middle line:84%
someone should write
a self-help book,

00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:19.670 align:middle line:84%
"How to Suffer in 10 Easy
Steps," and then off we go.

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:24.320 align:middle line:84%
So apparently with her family
that that was something her--

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:25.970 align:middle line:90%
you say, where's mom?

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And her dad would say, oh,
she's upstairs suffering.

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:31.130 align:middle line:90%
She does it so well.

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:33.800 align:middle line:84%
So her dad gave her
the name Deirdre,

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:38.210 align:middle line:84%
which in Irish folklore, it
was Deirdre of the Sorrows

00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:41.300 align:middle line:84%
because there's this whole thing
about that she goes through.

00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:43.480 align:middle line:90%
So that was kind of the--

00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and there's
another point in the book where

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:47.990 align:middle line:84%
you say she brought
something through.

00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:49.190 align:middle line:90%
She's quite intuitive.

00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:53.390 align:middle line:84%
When you were in Siena
at the Basilica, right?

00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Oh, god, I love Siena, and
I love the Duomo in Siena.

00:56:57.860 --> 00:56:59.530 align:middle line:84%
We just went there
exactly a year ago.

00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:00.530 align:middle line:90%
It's so beautiful.

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And she brought
something through talking

00:57:02.810 --> 00:57:04.160 align:middle line:90%
with St. Catherine, right?

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:05.420 align:middle line:90%
And I wrote it down here.

00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:08.750 align:middle line:84%
"Catherine wants you to know
suffering was a pathway to God,

00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:11.400 align:middle line:90%
but this is no longer the way.

00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:14.220 align:middle line:84%
It is not the end of
suffering, however."

00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:16.276 align:middle line:90%
What did that mean?

00:57:16.276 --> 00:57:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: It means that
the idea that you would--

00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:21.510 align:middle line:84%
back then when
Catherine did this,

00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:23.285 align:middle line:84%
you would consciously
take on suffering.

00:57:23.285 --> 00:57:24.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, there
were other people

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:27.077 align:middle line:84%
like if you did something bad,
you'd put on the hair shirt

00:57:27.077 --> 00:57:28.000 align:middle line:90%
and whip yourself.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:28.720 align:middle line:90%
So you would suffer--

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:29.887 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Self-flagellation

00:57:29.887 --> 00:57:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: --and all that stuff.

00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:36.660 align:middle line:84%
That was looked as a pathway
in order to holiness.

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:40.810 align:middle line:84%
But that's like, OK, that
was a phase we went through,

00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:43.170 align:middle line:84%
but it's time to
move beyond that.

00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:45.900 align:middle line:84%
It's time to move
beyond that and to have

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:48.780 align:middle line:84%
a different relationship
with suffering.

00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A more conscious one.

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: A more conscious one.

00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- we were
in the cathedral there.

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's where, you know,
her skull is in that cathedral

00:57:59.050 --> 00:57:59.850 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And she's telling me this stuff,
and we had our tour guide.

00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And the tour guide's
eyes were like saucers,

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:08.430 align:middle line:84%
and all her hair is
standing up on end saying,

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:11.000 align:middle line:90%
what is going on?

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.670 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is what Deirdre does.

00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:15.570 align:middle line:10%
She's talking to Catherine,
believe it or not.

00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:18.045 align:middle line:90%
And it was electric.

00:58:18.045 --> 00:58:20.550 align:middle line:90%


00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:23.490 align:middle line:10%
And that was actually before
I was writing the book.

00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:25.410 align:middle line:90%
And so it just came back to me.

00:58:25.410 --> 00:58:27.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, my
god, that's something

00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:31.230 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to redefine--
how we look at suffering.

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Because back then, it was
just, again, hurt myself.

00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And part of that was because
of the whole church's focus

00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:40.450 align:middle line:84%
on Jesus and suffering
on the cross.

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: That suffering
became really a part of it.

00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:46.995 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, it's time
to move beyond that.

00:58:46.995 --> 00:58:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: To do it consciously.

00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:51.360 align:middle line:84%
So just as you
brought it forward,

00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:54.090 align:middle line:84%
everything you did in "What
the Bleep Do We Know?"

00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:57.505 align:middle line:84%
in terms of understanding
this whole matrix of belief

00:58:57.505 --> 00:58:59.880 align:middle line:84%
and the effect on our lives
and what we can bring through

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:00.750 align:middle line:90%
in ourselves.

00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're bringing
to us the notion

00:59:02.730 --> 00:59:05.010 align:middle line:84%
that we need to address the
suffering underneath all

00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:08.370 align:middle line:84%
of these desires and so
forth so that we can do

00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:09.960 align:middle line:90%
that in a more conscious way.

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:11.250 align:middle line:90%
So you're still at it.

00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: I am still at it.

00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:14.280 align:middle line:10%
And I got to tell
you, I am still

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:18.120 align:middle line:10%
so surprised I wrote a book on
suffering because it's not my--

00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:19.620 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you know,
I'm kind of nerdy.

00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:20.537 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:59:20.537 --> 00:59:23.010 align:middle line:10%
>>ARNTZ: You know, da-da-da-da
da-da-da and to do that.

00:59:23.010 --> 00:59:25.170 align:middle line:10%
But I got tricked into it.

00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:26.820 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the only way
that I got started

00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:29.440 align:middle line:10%
was that-- 'cause I have
a funny sense of humor.

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.940 align:middle line:10%
At least, I hope it's funny.

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:31.340 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:32.280 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it's cute.

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.822 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of
cute stuff in there.

00:59:33.822 --> 00:59:34.623 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yeah.

00:59:34.623 --> 00:59:36.540 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I had the sense
of humor and the fact

00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:38.700 align:middle line:90%
that I could do the satire.

00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:43.312 align:middle line:84%
And I started writing it just
to write a couple of chapters

00:59:43.312 --> 00:59:45.270 align:middle line:84%
as a satire that I would
send to my friends who

00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:49.025 align:middle line:84%
write self-help books, and
we'll all have a laugh.

00:59:49.025 --> 00:59:51.400 align:middle line:84%
I kept writing, and a year
and a half later, it was done.

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was like oh,
my god, who knew?

00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.100 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:56.693 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, maybe its
moment has arrived, too.

00:59:56.693 --> 00:59:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: It's looking
that way because--

00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's looking that way
'cause there's less suffering

01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:00.660 align:middle line:90%
beginning.

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNTZ: A lot of
suffering, here we go.

01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:03.860 align:middle line:90%
William, thank you so much.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:06.130 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate you
taking the time to do this

01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and having this conversation
about something that's

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:09.922 align:middle line:84%
not my favorite
go-to subject either.

01:00:09.922 --> 01:00:10.722 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: Yeah.

01:00:10.722 --> 01:00:11.600 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:12.400 align:middle line:90%
But see--

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But it has a lot of
depth and beauty in it, too,

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.540 align:middle line:84%
when you look at it
at it's highest level.

01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNTZ: You do.

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.
