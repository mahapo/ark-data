[ Music ]

00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:21.555 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: I would
guess that many of you

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:24.592 align:middle line:84%
who have been to one of more
of the planet sacred sites.

00:00:24.592 --> 00:00:27.094 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't, you would not
want to miss this interview.

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:29.864 align:middle line:84%
It's a primer for understanding
why these thoughts affect us

00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:31.198 align:middle line:90%
as they do.

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:34.368 align:middle line:84%
This is a story of great beings,
a living earth with water

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:37.471 align:middle line:84%
and energy flowing through
like the blood in our own veins

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:39.707 align:middle line:84%
and phenomenal structures
that allow us

00:00:39.707 --> 00:00:42.910 align:middle line:84%
to access the higher parts
of our own consciousness.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.912 align:middle line:84%
No one knows this
better than Freddy Silva

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:46.914 align:middle line:84%
who I'm honored to
have back with us.

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:48.282 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to see you again.

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:49.717 align:middle line:84%
>> Freddy Silva: Regina,
good to be here again.

00:00:49.717 --> 00:00:51.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: You
know, I'd say on this one,

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.187 align:middle line:84%
you have totally
outdone yourself.

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:55.856 align:middle line:84%
I've been a fan of your work
since the Crop Circle work,

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:58.025 align:middle line:84%
you know that's where I kind
of came into the picture.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.860 align:middle line:84%
You have completely
outdone yourself.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this book has pretty
much all of the-the basis

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.203 align:middle line:84%
for the phenomenon behind
it written in a way that's

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:12.406 align:middle line:84%
so accessible and it's laid with
personal stories as well to kind

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:15.976 align:middle line:84%
of augment, you know, our
voyeurism along the away.

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:17.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Freddy Silva:
[laughter] Yeah,

00:01:17.378 --> 00:01:19.879 align:middle line:84%
the kitchen sink is somewhere
on page three hundred eighteen.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:21.282 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Something like that.

00:01:21.282 --> 00:01:24.185 align:middle line:84%
Let's see, Barbara Hand Clow,
and I totally agree with ther,

00:01:24.185 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:84%
says, "This is a must read for
all who read Sacred Sites."

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:84%
It is, so this is-this is your
partner if you're going anywhere

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.695 align:middle line:84%
in the world and
really experience,

00:01:34.695 --> 00:01:37.097 align:middle line:84%
so you say in this book, one
of the things in the world,

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:40.968 align:middle line:84%
and I already alluded to in the
open, that when it's all said

00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:43.804 align:middle line:84%
and when we're back engineering,
we're back into the story,

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:46.507 align:middle line:84%
this is really about
human awakening.

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:50.144 align:middle line:84%
All of these sites are about
awakening our own consciousness

00:01:50.144 --> 00:01:51.478 align:middle line:90%
and coming to know ourselves.

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:52.313 align:middle line:90%
Is that-

00:01:52.313 --> 00:01:53.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Freddy Silva: Oh, absolutely.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:55.349 align:middle line:84%
I do go any the temples
around the world,

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:58.586 align:middle line:84%
in particular the ones in Egypt,
the ones in Southern India,

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:01.155 align:middle line:84%
who are still very much
intact; they still have a lot

00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:04.124 align:middle line:84%
of the text written on
the walls, and ones we sat

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.627 align:middle line:84%
down to decipher what the text
was saying, it's quite clear

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:08.262 align:middle line:84%
that all of them were
written in agreement.

00:02:08.262 --> 00:02:10.497 align:middle line:84%
There is one in Temple of
[inaudible] for example,

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:13.701 align:middle line:84%
that talks about how the temple
is built to transform a person

00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:17.338 align:middle line:84%
into a god, into a bright
star, which is not a bad reason

00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:19.373 align:middle line:90%
to go there in the first place.

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And other temples talk about how
these are transmutations points

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.845 align:middle line:84%
of the soul where heaven
connects with earth,

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:28.315 align:middle line:84%
where the temple is kind
of living intermediate

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:30.251 align:middle line:90%
between the physical human

00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:31.919 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
that's in the cosmos.

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.388 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, it almost
reminded you

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:90%
that whenever you lose the plot,

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.293 align:middle line:84%
and we do this regularly
all the time these days,

00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:42.296 align:middle line:84%
you-the ancestors who built
these temples left us the

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:44.965 align:middle line:84%
instructions of where
to go, certain hotspots

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:46.233 align:middle line:90%
on the phase of the earth.

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:47.968 align:middle line:84%
We can go and basically
[inaudible] to the rest

00:02:47.968 --> 00:02:50.537 align:middle line:84%
of the universe and find
how things really are,

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:54.308 align:middle line:84%
get to know ourselves, get to
know the purpose of our soul,

00:02:54.308 --> 00:02:58.012 align:middle line:84%
and by doing that in a kind
of shamanic environment,

00:02:58.012 --> 00:03:00.314 align:middle line:84%
then you are able
to mold your life

00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:02.316 align:middle line:84%
with a certain degree
of self impalement.

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:06.186 align:middle line:84%
When you have that degree of
self awareness in your life,

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.055 align:middle line:84%
no one can really
tell you what to do,

00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:90%
not a bad way in your life.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.496 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: No, it's not, and that
has been [inaudible] some can

00:03:15.496 --> 00:03:17.364 align:middle line:90%
say, by intent.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:21.702 align:middle line:84%
It's not an accident that these
edifices have been destroyed

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:24.505 align:middle line:84%
over the last few thousand
years in particular,

00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:28.709 align:middle line:84%
and there has been a great
detriment, but the reality is,

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.111 align:middle line:84%
as we are going to get
into, these places are built

00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:35.082 align:middle line:84%
in sacred spots, and even if
the dwelling should fall down,

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:36.216 align:middle line:90%
if you knew where to go,

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.085 align:middle line:84%
they have the same
effect on us, right?

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:39.286 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Absolutely.

00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:42.156 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're all
harnessed with natural laws

00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:44.391 align:middle line:90%
and today we have the mechanism

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:47.728 align:middle line:84%
to understand what the natural
laws they were harnessing

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:49.930 align:middle line:84%
because thousands of
them have the same things

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.298 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:53.033 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the oldest
professions,

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:55.803 align:middle line:84%
that people would [inaudible],
couple of guys walking around,

00:03:55.803 --> 00:03:57.004 align:middle line:90%
a couple of [inaudible] hanging-

00:03:57.004 --> 00:03:57.871 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Totally valid.

00:03:57.871 --> 00:03:58.806 align:middle line:90%
I mean [inaudible]

00:03:58.806 --> 00:03:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: And for a
couple of dollars.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.674 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:01.875 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: You could actually
get the same result

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:04.011 align:middle line:84%
as a forty thousand dollar
megaton can do today.

00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:05.212 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:07.014 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: And there was one
particular case in England

00:04:07.014 --> 00:04:08.916 align:middle line:84%
in nineteen seventy
three where a group

00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:10.651 align:middle line:84%
of scientists actually
did an experiment

00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:15.022 align:middle line:84%
to locate magnetic energy in
these hotspots to try basically

00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:18.358 align:middle line:84%
to find out if these guru people
where up to no good in mystery,

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:20.793 align:middle line:84%
and they found- actually,
they were telling the truth

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:23.731 align:middle line:84%
because we actually have
found an actual mapping

00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:25.099 align:middle line:90%
of the stone circle in Britain

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.534 align:middle line:84%
that shows the lines
of the magnetic grid.

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:28.535 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:29.903 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: [inaudible]
into the entrance

00:04:29.903 --> 00:04:32.740 align:middle line:84%
of the stone circle co rounding
inside it like a great loop,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.942 align:middle line:84%
like a whirlpool, and
suddenly, like Alice going

00:04:34.942 --> 00:04:38.545 align:middle line:84%
down the rabbit hole that the
image [inaudible] the screen.

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:90%
So-

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.215 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And that's really the
job of the shaman, isn't it?

00:04:41.215 --> 00:04:44.551 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient priests, the
ones that were true priests.

00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:46.587 align:middle line:84%
I don't-I'm not talking
about the priesthood

00:04:46.587 --> 00:04:48.355 align:middle line:84%
that we know today,
which is more political

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:49.656 align:middle line:90%
in nature often times.

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:52.459 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the ones that were
the shamans and the priests.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.896 align:middle line:84%
They didn't need the dowsing
routes; they were just attuned

00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:59.666 align:middle line:84%
and aligned with the
energies that flexes and flows

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:00.667 align:middle line:90%
of those energies as well.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:03.337 align:middle line:84%
That was part of
their job, wasn't it?

00:05:03.337 --> 00:05:04.171 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Totally.

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:05.706 align:middle line:90%
These were higher entity people.

00:05:05.706 --> 00:05:09.276 align:middle line:84%
They basically were so
connected to the ways of means

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:12.546 align:middle line:84%
of what we would describe in
the modern world as the force.

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:15.349 align:middle line:84%
There's no accident
that George Lucas wrote

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.484 align:middle line:90%
that into the script.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:20.754 align:middle line:84%
This force is everywhere; it's
basically electromagnetic;

00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:23.590 align:middle line:84%
it's also to do with the
force of water, solar energy,

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.660 align:middle line:84%
lunar energy, and these
people were so in contact

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.929 align:middle line:84%
with the environment around
them, they could see it.

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:32.699 align:middle line:84%
They knew its ways and means,
its flows, its whirlpools.

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.035 align:middle line:84%
If you talk to a
North American shaman,

00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:36.136 align:middle line:84%
they'd be able to-they'd
still be able

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:38.806 align:middle line:84%
to find these hot spots
today, which is why

00:05:38.806 --> 00:05:42.476 align:middle line:84%
in North America we don't have
that many visible sacred sites.

00:05:42.476 --> 00:05:44.611 align:middle line:84%
They are on the land;
they know where to go

00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:46.847 align:middle line:84%
to source this information,
which brings

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:48.382 align:middle line:90%
up the other word, a sorcerer.

00:05:48.382 --> 00:05:51.652 align:middle line:84%
It never was anything
with magical

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that matter.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.523 align:middle line:84%
It was more to do with sourcing
the original point of energy.

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:57.991 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
word comes from,

00:05:57.991 --> 00:06:01.295 align:middle line:84%
someone who sources the
original energy of the land.

00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:04.731 align:middle line:84%
And these people in Australia
today, the aboriginal culture,

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.901 align:middle line:84%
they still source the original
hot spots; they thought

00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:10.304 align:middle line:84%
of these [inaudible]
lines to the desert.

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:13.974 align:middle line:84%
So you met in Australia, it
is full sand, in the Santa,

00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:17.611 align:middle line:84%
and this person goes to a
specific hotspot and goes,

00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:20.547 align:middle line:84%
"I can hear the song
of the ancestors,"

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:22.149 align:middle line:90%
and they'll suddenly turn right.

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:23.951 align:middle line:84%
They'll follow this
invisible pathway

00:06:23.951 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:84%
for god know how many
lines, and suddenly they are

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.391 align:middle line:84%
on a natural North American-I'm
sorry, aboriginal sacred site

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:90%
without any sign posts.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.429 align:middle line:84%
They can hear and they
can see this energy.

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:36.597 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And there
are other tribes

00:06:36.597 --> 00:06:38.031 align:middle line:84%
like the Cobian [phonetic]
in Bolivia that hid

00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:39.700 align:middle line:90%
and follow the same lines

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.437 align:middle line:84%
and find their brother
Hopi, for example, walking.

00:06:43.437 --> 00:06:45.272 align:middle line:84%
Well, once you get
off the boat, right?

00:06:45.272 --> 00:06:49.076 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] But no, the
interesting thing is,

00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:52.946 align:middle line:84%
all of these places
you're talking about,

00:06:52.946 --> 00:06:54.848 align:middle line:84%
these hotspots-well, first
I want to bring up one

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:56.550 align:middle line:84%
of the-you just brought
up sorcerer.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.853 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring up another
symbol that is deeply encoded

00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:02.723 align:middle line:84%
into almost every ancient
and prehistoric culture,

00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:05.158 align:middle line:84%
which is the serpent, and
you were just bringing

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:07.728 align:middle line:84%
up this fluoric [inaudible]
energy.

00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:10.931 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what the
serpent originally-originally

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:12.799 align:middle line:84%
before religion became
involved represented.

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:16.904 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Ah, yes, religion,
a very interesting concept.

00:07:16.904 --> 00:07:19.306 align:middle line:84%
In the original story of Adam
and Eve, which is where one

00:07:19.306 --> 00:07:22.209 align:middle line:84%
of our western traditions
really begins in terms

00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:25.412 align:middle line:84%
of our relationship with
the serpent comes from.

00:07:25.412 --> 00:07:27.014 align:middle line:84%
It's funny how the
original story,

00:07:27.014 --> 00:07:30.450 align:middle line:84%
the serpent is actually the
Bethlehem hero of the story,

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.853 align:middle line:84%
and you have to go and read the
original [inaudible] gospels

00:07:32.853 --> 00:07:35.489 align:middle line:84%
to get that that understanding
because then it was then turned

00:07:35.489 --> 00:07:38.058 align:middle line:84%
around and officially became
the symbol of the devil,

00:07:38.058 --> 00:07:40.027 align:middle line:84%
but back in the old
days, if you wanted

00:07:40.027 --> 00:07:44.031 align:middle line:84%
to exemplify the natural
flow of the earth's energy,

00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:45.499 align:middle line:84%
you'd use the serpent
as a symbol.

00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:48.135 align:middle line:84%
So, if you go to China,
they would have the dragon;

00:07:48.135 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:84%
they call these lions
the long mane.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.639 align:middle line:84%
In Ireland they still
call them the fairy lions.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.541 align:middle line:84%
So, depending on where
you are in the world,

00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:57.511 align:middle line:84%
the serpent takes a different
mysticism, a different look,

00:07:57.511 --> 00:07:59.346 align:middle line:84%
but it's always the
same serpent that flows

00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:00.781 align:middle line:90%
through the landscape.

00:08:00.781 --> 00:08:03.984 align:middle line:84%
So, when you go to a place like
Whales Cathedral in England,

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:06.753 align:middle line:84%
for example, or some of these
sacred sites throughout Europe,

00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:08.288 align:middle line:90%
you'd see a serpent carved.

00:08:08.288 --> 00:08:12.659 align:middle line:84%
It's a very unusual part of the
building, and that's exactly

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.695 align:middle line:84%
where the path of
the energy flows

00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:16.029 align:middle line:90%
through the actual structure.

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:17.531 align:middle line:90%
So, once you're looking for this

00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:20.767 align:middle line:84%
and you understand the
symbolism behind the serpent,

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:22.202 align:middle line:84%
and you're going through
these places and you see

00:08:22.202 --> 00:08:25.339 align:middle line:84%
that symbol tucked
away in strange places,

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:26.873 align:middle line:84%
you know you're standing
in a margin line

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:29.409 align:middle line:84%
because the architects
knew how to guide you

00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:30.444 align:middle line:90%
into a certain direction.

00:08:30.444 --> 00:08:31.811 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That makes perfect sense.

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:34.647 align:middle line:84%
When you think of the shaman
watching the energy on the land,

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:37.484 align:middle line:84%
it would look very
much like a serpent

00:08:37.484 --> 00:08:40.186 align:middle line:84%
as it moves along its
pathway on the land,

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.888 align:middle line:84%
so it's just logical
like you're saying.

00:08:42.888 --> 00:08:44.157 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Oh, absolutely.

00:08:44.157 --> 00:08:45.392 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And then it became
in alignment with the word

00:08:45.392 --> 00:08:47.494 align:middle line:84%
"knowledge" when it started
going in biblical text,

00:08:47.494 --> 00:08:51.531 align:middle line:84%
and then it became aligned
with Satan, and the fall,

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.433 align:middle line:90%
and etcetera, etcetera.

00:08:53.433 --> 00:08:54.701 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Very unfortunate.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.103 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, and you know,
there are a lot of people

00:08:56.103 --> 00:09:00.073 align:middle line:84%
that write esoteric materials
to this day, who-you know,

00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:03.977 align:middle line:84%
you have to wonder what they're
attempting to in part to us

00:09:03.977 --> 00:09:06.446 align:middle line:84%
and what their motivation
is-who still,

00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:08.515 align:middle line:84%
even in these metaphysical
circles,

00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:11.685 align:middle line:84%
demonize the symbolism
of the serpent.

00:09:11.685 --> 00:09:13.086 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: It's bizarre, isn't it?

00:09:13.086 --> 00:09:15.822 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once an idea takes hold
and it gets promoted and again,

00:09:15.822 --> 00:09:18.292 align:middle line:84%
and again, and again, and
repeats in a pattern fashion,

00:09:18.292 --> 00:09:20.727 align:middle line:84%
it seems to take a hold of
the cycling; it takes forever

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.963 align:middle line:90%
for this to be resolved.

00:09:22.963 --> 00:09:25.732 align:middle line:84%
The swastika is the
other plastic symbol.

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:29.636 align:middle line:84%
It started as a symbol of well
being in the Hindu culture;

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:31.738 align:middle line:90%
suddenly becomes turned around.

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:34.908 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, these things take
a while to revert back

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:38.478 align:middle line:84%
to their original meaning,
like the upside down pentagram,

00:09:38.478 --> 00:09:40.847 align:middle line:84%
which is really-the
pentagram is a symbol of life.

00:09:40.847 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a Geometry
of all life.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.751 align:middle line:84%
So the serpent is
the same thing;

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:46.653 align:middle line:84%
it suddenly became
associated with knowledge,

00:09:46.653 --> 00:09:50.924 align:middle line:84%
just in the Sumerian culture, as
it is in the Egyptian culture,

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:53.794 align:middle line:84%
and so many indigenous
cultures around the world,

00:09:53.794 --> 00:09:56.263 align:middle line:84%
but then once organized
religion starts kicking in,

00:09:56.263 --> 00:09:57.831 align:middle line:90%
around thirteen hundred B.C.,

00:09:57.831 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:84%
you start to be seeing
the priesthood taking

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.203 align:middle line:84%
over the original concept of
the temple and the sacred site;

00:10:03.203 --> 00:10:06.873 align:middle line:84%
it starts being a place where
people can go and communicate

00:10:06.873 --> 00:10:08.875 align:middle line:84%
with the other world,
as they call it.

00:10:08.875 --> 00:10:11.611 align:middle line:84%
You get a living intermediate
now having in between saying,

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:15.549 align:middle line:84%
"If you want to reach the other
world, you have to talk to me;

00:10:15.549 --> 00:10:16.983 align:middle line:84%
[inaudible] the money,
I'll say some prayers

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:18.251 align:middle line:90%
for you, you'll be OK."

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:20.454 align:middle line:84%
And that's when organized
religion starts taking

00:10:20.454 --> 00:10:22.255 align:middle line:84%
over this concept of the
serpent and the knowledge,

00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:24.257 align:middle line:84%
and turning it in a
very interesting thing

00:10:24.257 --> 00:10:26.526 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want
you to have direct access

00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:29.596 align:middle line:84%
to this knowledge, but you go
back to the Egyptian temples,

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:32.532 align:middle line:84%
and even some of the
tombs of the Pharaohs,

00:10:32.532 --> 00:10:35.368 align:middle line:84%
some of where not actually
used as tombs of death;

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:39.339 align:middle line:84%
they were used as tombs for
the living, and there is one

00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:42.709 align:middle line:84%
in Sacara particularly,
which there was an scripture

00:10:42.709 --> 00:10:46.246 align:middle line:84%
on the wall that clearly states
that the Pharaoh is going

00:10:46.246 --> 00:10:49.116 align:middle line:84%
to sleep, and is going to the
other world, and has been guided

00:10:49.116 --> 00:10:51.785 align:middle line:84%
into the other world,
when then he arises

00:10:51.785 --> 00:10:54.087 align:middle line:84%
to be greeted by
the morning star.

00:10:54.087 --> 00:10:57.791 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that this
ritual was actually done

00:10:57.791 --> 00:11:00.327 align:middle line:84%
to the Pharaoh who is being
initiated into the mysteries

00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:04.831 align:middle line:84%
of the knowledge to spend an
evening at the end of his years

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:07.134 align:middle line:90%
of doctri-indoctrination.

00:11:07.134 --> 00:11:09.202 align:middle line:84%
He would be awaken up
by a priest first thing

00:11:09.202 --> 00:11:11.972 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, still
half asleep, still dazed,

00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:14.908 align:middle line:84%
and he would be risen
from a figurative grave,

00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:18.145 align:middle line:84%
where at point he'd become
enlightened, he'd become risen,

00:11:18.145 --> 00:11:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly he'd be
taken out of the tomb

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.182 align:middle line:84%
and he'd meet the
morning star series,

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:23.884 align:middle line:90%
star of the divine feminine.

00:11:23.884 --> 00:11:25.786 align:middle line:84%
Betty, this is the
concept of resurrection,

00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:28.855 align:middle line:84%
which has been-again, another
concept that's been completed

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:30.023 align:middle line:90%
turned upside down.

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:33.226 align:middle line:84%
The resurrection is
supposed to be associated

00:11:33.226 --> 00:11:35.328 align:middle line:90%
with living people, dead people.

00:11:35.328 --> 00:11:37.664 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to experience
resurrection while still

00:11:37.664 --> 00:11:38.598 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:11:38.598 --> 00:11:39.966 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: The enlightenment.

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:42.402 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Yes, the gospel of Thomas
tells us that specifically.

00:11:42.402 --> 00:11:44.604 align:middle line:84%
So these things are
all part of the way

00:11:44.604 --> 00:11:47.773 align:middle line:84%
that you learn the knowledge for
many years of indoctrination,

00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:51.411 align:middle line:84%
and then you have this final
moment when you're risen

00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:53.747 align:middle line:84%
from the grave, and
then you came out,

00:11:53.747 --> 00:11:54.815 align:middle line:90%
you're totally enlightened,

00:11:54.815 --> 00:11:57.417 align:middle line:84%
and this is why they
call the risen dead,

00:11:57.417 --> 00:11:59.653 align:middle line:84%
the people who were
totally enlightened, so.

00:11:59.653 --> 00:12:00.954 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:12:00.954 --> 00:12:02.255 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: And again, it brings
us back to the purpose

00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:04.724 align:middle line:84%
of the sacred sites, which
is to basically connect you

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:07.294 align:middle line:84%
to the other world while
you're still in the body,

00:12:07.294 --> 00:12:08.929 align:middle line:84%
so you can bring
back the information

00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:11.598 align:middle line:84%
from the other world, and
apply it in your new life.

00:12:11.598 --> 00:12:14.367 align:middle line:84%
You are now aware of the world
around you, how it works,

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:16.770 align:middle line:84%
how the universe works
around you, and when you have

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.573 align:middle line:84%
that degree of knowledge,
you have a very fine degree

00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:22.275 align:middle line:84%
of control of your
manifestation presence.

00:12:22.275 --> 00:12:23.643 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:12:23.643 --> 00:12:25.345 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: And that's very important
and dangerous paradoxically.

00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:26.446 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, it can be.

00:12:26.446 --> 00:12:29.549 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it can, and so
indefinitely threatening

00:12:29.549 --> 00:12:31.484 align:middle line:84%
to the power structures
that exist right now.

00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:34.621 align:middle line:84%
They would prefer people not
go into this self empowerment.

00:12:34.621 --> 00:12:35.622 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: They'd be out of a job.

00:12:35.622 --> 00:12:36.923 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, they'd
be out of a job.

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:39.426 align:middle line:84%
So, now, I wasn't going to
get into this at this point,

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.695 align:middle line:84%
but since you already
broke the subject.

00:12:41.695 --> 00:12:44.197 align:middle line:84%
Because you've been to all these
wonderful sites throughout your

00:12:44.197 --> 00:12:48.468 align:middle line:84%
life, you had a really profound
experience yourself in line

00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:52.172 align:middle line:84%
in one of the tombs, so to
speak, in the Great Pyramid,

00:12:52.172 --> 00:12:55.642 align:middle line:84%
which Napoleon did as well;
others have done as well.

00:12:55.642 --> 00:12:58.178 align:middle line:84%
I would love it if
you shared that story

00:12:58.178 --> 00:13:01.214 align:middle line:84%
because it gives people a
glimpse of what you can access

00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:02.449 align:middle line:90%
when you put yourself in one

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:04.751 align:middle line:84%
of these really truly
powerful places.

00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:06.419 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: And they really
are very powerful,

00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:10.357 align:middle line:84%
and it was an experience that
shaped who I am as a person,

00:13:10.357 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and the best part is, I wasn't
looking for an experience.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.829 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I've been doing
this journey for a couple

00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:19.366 align:middle line:84%
of decades, learning from
people who've done it properly,

00:13:19.366 --> 00:13:21.735 align:middle line:84%
learning by their example;
so I've been very blessed

00:13:21.735 --> 00:13:23.703 align:middle line:84%
to have good teachers
to go with,

00:13:23.703 --> 00:13:26.573 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things we did was
to go in pilgrimages to Egypt

00:13:26.573 --> 00:13:29.676 align:middle line:84%
to learn about the mysteries
of how the temples were used.

00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ideas was to
go into the Great Pyramid,

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.516 align:middle line:84%
and by this time, several
of us knew the presence

00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:38.985 align:middle line:84%
of un grind sacred sites; we
knew what these places did

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:41.521 align:middle line:84%
for you and to you
and to be very aware

00:13:41.521 --> 00:13:44.457 align:middle line:84%
of your presence before you go
in because these things tend

00:13:44.457 --> 00:13:47.594 align:middle line:84%
to manifest and multiply
what you take in there,

00:13:47.594 --> 00:13:49.095 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of all energy.

00:13:49.095 --> 00:13:52.065 align:middle line:84%
So, there is a whole group
of us to go to around Egypt

00:13:52.065 --> 00:13:54.935 align:middle line:84%
and around the world,
basically restoring life

00:13:54.935 --> 00:13:58.038 align:middle line:90%
to sacred places very quietly.

00:13:58.038 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And we managed to get
about six tickets to go

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.410 align:middle line:84%
into the Great Pyramid at
that time; so the whole

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.278 align:middle line:84%
of the group was being
basically outside the building,

00:14:05.278 --> 00:14:08.114 align:middle line:84%
and six of us went in,
and we got up to the top;

00:14:08.114 --> 00:14:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and if anyone has ever
been to the Great Pyramid,

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.753 align:middle line:84%
you'll know what a cacophony it
is in there, the reverberation

00:14:13.753 --> 00:14:16.089 align:middle line:90%
of any little sound is amplified

00:14:16.089 --> 00:14:17.824 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
it's deafening.

00:14:17.824 --> 00:14:19.225 align:middle line:90%
So we go in up.

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:22.195 align:middle line:84%
This kid is running around de
Grand Gallery and then we get

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.596 align:middle line:84%
to the top of the
King's chamber,

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:26.633 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly the whole building
empties; there isn't a sound.

00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:28.868 align:middle line:84%
And the two men that were with
us, they didn't like the energy

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:30.570 align:middle line:84%
in there and they left,
which is interesting

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.306 align:middle line:84%
because it's actually a
very masculine energy place.

00:14:33.306 --> 00:14:35.542 align:middle line:84%
The building next door is
actually a more feminine

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:37.410 align:middle line:90%
energy pyramid.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.747 align:middle line:84%
So the full guide runs the-and
one of them says, "Well,

00:14:40.747 --> 00:14:43.216 align:middle line:84%
while we're here and we're all
alone in this place so nice

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:46.519 align:middle line:84%
and quiet," and at that moment
the lights went off as well.

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:48.788 align:middle line:84%
We were in total pitch
darkness; you can't see a thing.

00:14:48.788 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: An experience was
being arranged for you.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Something was going
on and we thought, "Well,

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.594 align:middle line:90%
we got the place to ourselves.

00:14:54.594 --> 00:14:56.596 align:middle line:84%
It's pitch dark, let's
read one of the signs."

00:14:56.596 --> 00:14:57.597 align:middle line:90%
You do it.

00:14:57.597 --> 00:14:58.665 align:middle line:84%
Why me. Because you've
taught before.

00:14:58.665 --> 00:15:02.135 align:middle line:84%
OK. And I let this
toning while you pick

00:15:02.135 --> 00:15:04.037 align:middle line:84%
up on a rezoning
frequency of the chamber;

00:15:04.037 --> 00:15:05.572 align:middle line:84%
each place has its
own particular nerve,

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:08.708 align:middle line:84%
and there were sounds coming
out of me that had never came

00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:10.610 align:middle line:84%
out before and haven't
come out since,

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.113 align:middle line:84%
and the other three guys
were also toning with me

00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:15.482 align:middle line:84%
in a way I've never heard
them do that before.

00:15:15.482 --> 00:15:17.384 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
beautiful symphony going

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:19.386 align:middle line:84%
on in this chamber, and
suddenly-and you've got

00:15:19.386 --> 00:15:20.787 align:middle line:84%
to remember, this is
complete darkness,

00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:23.289 align:middle line:84%
you can't see your
hand in front of you.

00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:26.493 align:middle line:84%
I saw with my vision-there
was all these people that came

00:15:26.493 --> 00:15:28.895 align:middle line:84%
out of the stone surrounding
us in a huge circle,

00:15:28.895 --> 00:15:33.133 align:middle line:84%
dressed in the most beautiful
sort of silken white clothing,

00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:36.736 align:middle line:84%
very, very tall people, and they
sort of just bowed their heads,

00:15:36.736 --> 00:15:38.104 align:middle line:90%
and we sort of bowed back

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:40.907 align:middle line:84%
as if I'm just looking
at you right now.

00:15:40.907 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was the strangest
feeling; we kept doing this,

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.478 align:middle line:84%
and doing this, and suddenly
the lights come back on,

00:15:45.478 --> 00:15:48.348 align:middle line:84%
after fifteen minutes,
and it's quite clear

00:15:48.348 --> 00:15:50.683 align:middle line:84%
that we're quite dazed,
and no one is saying a word

00:15:50.683 --> 00:15:54.320 align:middle line:84%
and the ballistic [inaudible]
given to the coffin as well,

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.189 align:middle line:84%
for no one had been
buried there.

00:15:56.189 --> 00:15:58.491 align:middle line:84%
And each of us took turns
lying on the sarcophagus,

00:15:58.491 --> 00:16:01.227 align:middle line:84%
and we're all different
height, five foot five,

00:16:01.227 --> 00:16:03.763 align:middle line:84%
all the way to myself,
who I'm six foot five,

00:16:03.763 --> 00:16:05.632 align:middle line:84%
so there is at least
a foot in discrepancy.

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So now, if you're
looking at it objectively,

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.336 align:middle line:90%
what would you say, by I say,

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:12.005 align:middle line:84%
the length of that
sarcophagus is?

00:16:12.005 --> 00:16:13.773 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Oh, it's about the
length of this table, yeah.

00:16:13.773 --> 00:16:15.542 align:middle line:84%
It's about the length
of this table,

00:16:15.542 --> 00:16:18.011 align:middle line:84%
but here's the funny
thing about this story.

00:16:18.011 --> 00:16:20.346 align:middle line:84%
You got four different
guys, four different widths

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:22.148 align:middle line:84%
and heights, and
we all came back

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:25.752 align:middle line:84%
down the [inaudible] every
person was screaming downstairs,

00:16:25.752 --> 00:16:30.590 align:middle line:84%
you know, with the finger,
and we ran out of [inaudible],

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.159 align:middle line:84%
we said our welcome, and we
went out on broad daylight,

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:35.528 align:middle line:84%
and we're all very dazed, and
it's quite obvious they want

00:16:35.528 --> 00:16:38.665 align:middle line:84%
to say something, and I
thought, "Alright, I'll say.

00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:40.467 align:middle line:90%
Did you see what I saw?"

00:16:40.467 --> 00:16:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And he just carried on the
fort from there and said,

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.939 align:middle line:84%
"You mean all of those
people, those priests that came

00:16:45.939 --> 00:16:47.807 align:middle line:90%
out of the stones, surrounded us

00:16:47.807 --> 00:16:49.309 align:middle line:84%
in a big circle dressed
on white?"

00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:51.578 align:middle line:84%
I said, "So, I didn't
imagine that."

00:16:51.578 --> 00:16:52.779 align:middle line:90%
No. You saw that too?

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:54.614 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I saw that too.

00:16:54.614 --> 00:16:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And then we thought-and
the sarcophagus,

00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.186 align:middle line:84%
that was really weird because I
was scared because I am so tall,

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:02.589 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't fit, but
it was a perfect fit,

00:17:02.589 --> 00:17:04.756 align:middle line:84%
perfect shoulder width,
touched the top of my head,

00:17:04.756 --> 00:17:08.061 align:middle line:84%
the bottom of my feet, and the
guy who is five foot five says,

00:17:08.061 --> 00:17:09.395 align:middle line:90%
"But that happened to me too."

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:13.133 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well, a piece of
stone cannot do this according

00:17:13.133 --> 00:17:15.100 align:middle line:90%
to whoever is lying inside it."

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.404 align:middle line:84%
And we were still kind of
processing this, and we talked

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:21.773 align:middle line:84%
to our spiritual leader who
was a fabulous transmedium

00:17:21.773 --> 00:17:24.210 align:middle line:84%
[phonetic] who happens to
believe-have great respect

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.580 align:middle line:84%
for him in Britain, and
she-without saying a word

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:28.915 align:middle line:90%
to her, says, "Well, we tuned

00:17:28.915 --> 00:17:30.884 align:middle line:84%
into what you guys were
doing, and wasn't it great?

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:32.152 align:middle line:90%
You're in one of the sites

00:17:32.152 --> 00:17:35.388 align:middle line:84%
and with your intent the
priests came out of the stones?"

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.757 align:middle line:84%
I said, "You mean we
didn't make that out?"

00:17:37.757 --> 00:17:39.993 align:middle line:84%
Of course not; you
should know better by now.

00:17:39.993 --> 00:17:42.662 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "But what about
the size of the sarcophagus?"

00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:45.999 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's all I said, and she
says, "Well, it's living stone.

00:17:45.999 --> 00:17:48.535 align:middle line:84%
When you actually are
there to do the right work

00:17:48.535 --> 00:17:51.638 align:middle line:84%
with the right intent, the
building adapts itself to you.

00:17:51.638 --> 00:17:53.206 align:middle line:90%
Did you go somewhere else?"

00:17:53.206 --> 00:17:56.142 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you, I went into
very strange faraway places,

00:17:56.142 --> 00:17:58.144 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still processing
that information,

00:17:58.144 --> 00:18:02.148 align:middle line:84%
and half of it was what came out
into the book because my part

00:18:02.148 --> 00:18:05.185 align:middle line:84%
of my job here is to teach
people from experience.

00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:07.654 align:middle line:84%
So depends on what you
take into these places,

00:18:07.654 --> 00:18:10.657 align:middle line:84%
into these sacred sites,
that's what you get back.

00:18:10.657 --> 00:18:11.658 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to be
careful what you ask

00:18:11.658 --> 00:18:13.860 align:middle line:90%
for because you might get it.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.529 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But this one has a
particular richness and depth

00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:20.133 align:middle line:84%
to it, that-that's why I said
you've outdone yourself in this.

00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:23.503 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is-this is a
different octave of information;

00:18:23.503 --> 00:18:25.772 align:middle line:84%
and all of your books
are wonderful.

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:28.641 align:middle line:84%
You're s a wonderful writer and
researcher, but I don't know

00:18:28.641 --> 00:18:31.277 align:middle line:84%
if you experienced it that way
as you go back and you went

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:32.979 align:middle line:84%
through the other team
processes and said,

00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:36.883 align:middle line:84%
"But it had a different octave
of information in there."

00:18:36.883 --> 00:18:37.884 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: It's funny.

00:18:37.884 --> 00:18:40.587 align:middle line:84%
It's-and this runs
from all my books.

00:18:40.587 --> 00:18:43.623 align:middle line:84%
I mean there is a thought that
I have and I always give credit

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:46.492 align:middle line:84%
to the people who
work invisibly.

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:50.363 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that we work alone
any different minute of the day,

00:18:50.363 --> 00:18:51.698 align:middle line:90%
even when we're writing reports.

00:18:51.698 --> 00:18:54.133 align:middle line:84%
If you're passionate about
something, you go back

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:55.668 align:middle line:84%
and read the stuff
and you recognize it.

00:18:55.668 --> 00:18:58.471 align:middle line:84%
Some of the hand is helping
you, and I always acknowledge

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:01.374 align:middle line:84%
that because I do
feel very blessed

00:19:01.374 --> 00:19:05.612 align:middle line:84%
that I do have the right content
and try to do the right thing,

00:19:05.612 --> 00:19:07.714 align:middle line:84%
and I think the results show
themselves after a while

00:19:07.714 --> 00:19:10.550 align:middle line:84%
because I started getting
this information [inaudible]

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:11.718 align:middle line:90%
that was interesting.

00:19:11.718 --> 00:19:14.687 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do I back this
up using hard facts?

00:19:14.687 --> 00:19:17.624 align:middle line:84%
And if I look in the right
places, those facts start coming

00:19:17.624 --> 00:19:20.994 align:middle line:84%
up and after eighteen
pages of bibliography,

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:23.963 align:middle line:84%
it's quite clear there is a lot
of research that went into it

00:19:23.963 --> 00:19:25.932 align:middle line:84%
that validates some
of this material,

00:19:25.932 --> 00:19:28.801 align:middle line:84%
which is obviously channeled,
and that's what I like about it.

00:19:28.801 --> 00:19:30.236 align:middle line:84%
And that happens
when you connect

00:19:30.236 --> 00:19:31.537 align:middle line:90%
with the invisible world.

00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:33.273 align:middle line:84%
There is a relationship
going on,

00:19:33.273 --> 00:19:35.875 align:middle line:84%
a give and take all the
time, and if you just follow

00:19:35.875 --> 00:19:39.445 align:middle line:84%
that intuition, if you
look in the right places,

00:19:39.445 --> 00:19:41.915 align:middle line:84%
the information comes back and
finds you, and then you realize

00:19:41.915 --> 00:19:44.517 align:middle line:84%
that they're actually are
doing this almost as a joke

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.386 align:middle line:90%
to say, "Look, it's true.

00:19:46.386 --> 00:19:49.355 align:middle line:84%
There is a certain amount
of guidance that happens

00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:52.091 align:middle line:84%
in the invisible world,
and we are helping you,

00:19:52.091 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:84%
and we do these things
almost as a joke to get

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.863 align:middle line:84%
to trust the purpose
because we tend to forget it.

00:19:56.863 --> 00:19:58.197 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right, right.

00:19:58.197 --> 00:20:00.166 align:middle line:84%
I've been to a lot of sacred
sites, so I was very-I mean,

00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:03.269 align:middle line:84%
I was interested to
see your experiences

00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:06.272 align:middle line:84%
and the science behind why I
may have been experiencing some

00:20:06.272 --> 00:20:08.675 align:middle line:84%
of the things I experienced
on those sites; however,

00:20:08.675 --> 00:20:11.577 align:middle line:84%
after reading this
book, I thought,

00:20:11.577 --> 00:20:13.012 align:middle line:90%
"If I go back there again,

00:20:13.012 --> 00:20:15.715 align:middle line:84%
I would have a completely
different understanding

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:18.418 align:middle line:84%
of the forces that were
behind it, and I'd be able

00:20:18.418 --> 00:20:21.254 align:middle line:84%
to enter acknowledging
and honoring it

00:20:21.254 --> 00:20:23.923 align:middle line:90%
in a new way, I think.

00:20:23.923 --> 00:20:24.457 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Oh, good.

00:20:24.457 --> 00:20:25.792 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:20:25.792 --> 00:20:27.393 align:middle line:84%
No, I mean it, so, I can't
wait to go back and go to some

00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:29.996 align:middle line:84%
of those sites again with
this particular knowledge.

00:20:29.996 --> 00:20:33.466 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go into some of the
basics that you've covered here.

00:20:33.466 --> 00:20:34.767 align:middle line:90%
In the beginning of the book,

00:20:34.767 --> 00:20:37.203 align:middle line:84%
you talk about what it is
walled "the first occasion."

00:20:37.203 --> 00:20:38.671 align:middle line:90%
I want to get into that.

00:20:38.671 --> 00:20:41.908 align:middle line:84%
Also the navel of the earth,
and we'll show a couple images,

00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:47.513 align:middle line:84%
and pre and post
alluvial structures,

00:20:47.513 --> 00:20:49.215 align:middle line:90%
structures on top of structures.

00:20:49.215 --> 00:20:51.818 align:middle line:84%
So I may ask a question along
the way, but I would like you

00:20:51.818 --> 00:20:52.852 align:middle line:90%
to just kind of dive in

00:20:52.852 --> 00:20:54.821 align:middle line:84%
and start talking
about these things.

00:20:54.821 --> 00:20:56.723 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Ooh, the time
of the first occasion.

00:20:56.723 --> 00:20:58.324 align:middle line:90%
There was a wonderful woman

00:20:58.324 --> 00:21:01.227 align:middle line:84%
who has now passed away
[inaudible] in England.

00:21:01.227 --> 00:21:04.831 align:middle line:84%
She was your straight
forward academic working

00:21:04.831 --> 00:21:08.201 align:middle line:84%
for the University
of Manchester,

00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:11.704 align:middle line:84%
and she basically deciphered
the wall of the Temple

00:21:11.704 --> 00:21:13.172 align:middle line:90%
of Notch [phonetic] in Egypt.

00:21:13.172 --> 00:21:16.376 align:middle line:84%
This is a wall that has what
is called The Building Texts,

00:21:16.376 --> 00:21:19.379 align:middle line:84%
and it's a very dry
academic text.

00:21:19.379 --> 00:21:22.248 align:middle line:84%
You have to sit with it, be
patient with it, but it's full

00:21:22.248 --> 00:21:24.584 align:middle line:84%
of information, technical
information

00:21:24.584 --> 00:21:27.086 align:middle line:84%
of how temples were built,
when they were built,

00:21:27.086 --> 00:21:29.655 align:middle line:84%
why they were built, and
what they do to people.

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:30.790 align:middle line:90%
And there was a one way-

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.358 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Like a master guide.

00:21:32.358 --> 00:21:33.159 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Absolutely.

00:21:33.159 --> 00:21:34.394 align:middle line:90%
It's the essential guide

00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:37.030 align:middle line:84%
to how these things
actually do what they do.

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.998 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that they talked about,

00:21:38.998 --> 00:21:42.068 align:middle line:84%
and the Greeks were also
part of this process

00:21:42.068 --> 00:21:44.470 align:middle line:84%
because they rebuilt Anthem
into what it is today;

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.306 align:middle line:84%
so thanks to them we
have this information.

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And part of the building texts
talked about the occasion

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.179 align:middle line:84%
of the first time
when it was said

00:21:53.179 --> 00:21:56.082 align:middle line:84%
that way before there was
a purely human pharaoh,

00:21:56.082 --> 00:21:57.817 align:middle line:90%
and this is in their words, now.

00:21:57.817 --> 00:21:59.585 align:middle line:84%
When there is a purely
human pharaoh,

00:21:59.585 --> 00:22:02.855 align:middle line:84%
a guide called Mene [phonetic]
in thirty one hundred B.C.,

00:22:02.855 --> 00:22:06.526 align:middle line:84%
before him, there were
the semi divine kings,

00:22:06.526 --> 00:22:09.061 align:middle line:84%
who were called the Followers
of Horace, who were supposed

00:22:09.061 --> 00:22:13.032 align:middle line:84%
to be the survivor from a
huge cataclysm, a huge flood

00:22:13.032 --> 00:22:14.967 align:middle line:84%
that destroyed the
phase of the earth.

00:22:14.967 --> 00:22:18.704 align:middle line:84%
And before that, there was
people called The Creator Gods,

00:22:18.704 --> 00:22:22.809 align:middle line:84%
people in enormous statue
and is described the Temple

00:22:22.809 --> 00:22:24.744 align:middle line:84%
of Bethlehem [phonetic] and
they were about fifty feet tall.

00:22:24.744 --> 00:22:28.347 align:middle line:84%
We dug up some of these giant
graves all around the world,

00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:30.850 align:middle line:84%
so it's not a thing
of the imagination.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.886 align:middle line:84%
But they did claim
that [inaudible] that's

00:22:33.886 --> 00:22:36.956 align:middle line:84%
when the whole portion
of Egypt suddenly arises

00:22:36.956 --> 00:22:41.127 align:middle line:84%
as a singular concept, as if
the whole temple project has

00:22:41.127 --> 00:22:42.428 align:middle line:90%
been packed.

00:22:42.428 --> 00:22:43.229 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So [inaudible] is a
term that means [inaudible]

00:22:43.229 --> 00:22:44.263 align:middle line:90%
of the first occasion.

00:22:44.263 --> 00:22:45.598 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: The time of
the first occasion,

00:22:45.598 --> 00:22:48.801 align:middle line:84%
and it has been reliably dated
by Robert Bobal [phonetic]

00:22:48.801 --> 00:22:53.406 align:middle line:84%
to ten thousand five hundred
B.C. So this was very tonic

00:22:53.406 --> 00:22:56.142 align:middle line:84%
because only about a
thousand years after that,

00:22:56.142 --> 00:22:59.045 align:middle line:84%
the earth does experience
a huge cataclysm,

00:22:59.045 --> 00:23:01.280 align:middle line:84%
which has now been
proved by Geologists

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.784 align:middle line:84%
as having been a massive
flood; the [inaudible] rose

00:23:04.784 --> 00:23:07.553 align:middle line:84%
by a hundred fifty feet
in a blink of an eye.

00:23:07.553 --> 00:23:10.256 align:middle line:84%
We were hit by the comet-by
the remains of the comet,

00:23:10.256 --> 00:23:13.426 align:middle line:84%
which may have hit the earth
about seven times, most of them

00:23:13.426 --> 00:23:16.496 align:middle line:84%
in the sea, which of course
would have created waves beyond

00:23:16.496 --> 00:23:19.899 align:middle line:84%
our imagination, some of these
countries moved inland hundreds

00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:23.302 align:middle line:84%
of miles to get away from the
next potential catastrophe.

00:23:23.302 --> 00:23:26.405 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the texts from
India, Eastern Islands,

00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:28.407 align:middle line:90%
from Egypt, all people

00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:31.677 align:middle line:84%
who supposedly didn't have
any contact with each other,

00:23:31.677 --> 00:23:34.514 align:middle line:84%
they talk about how
there were survivors,

00:23:34.514 --> 00:23:38.484 align:middle line:84%
and people who were told
by the gods to build an ark

00:23:38.484 --> 00:23:41.854 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that there
was a piece of everything;

00:23:41.854 --> 00:23:45.658 align:middle line:84%
every living organism was on
this arks, and with these arks,

00:23:45.658 --> 00:23:49.395 align:middle line:84%
the captains were supposed
to take onboard seven sages,

00:23:49.395 --> 00:23:50.696 align:middle line:90%
and each of these seven sages-

00:23:50.696 --> 00:23:52.732 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And this is-this is
consistent throughout these

00:23:52.732 --> 00:23:53.566 align:middle line:90%
cultures [inaudible]

00:23:53.566 --> 00:23:54.267 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: [inaudible] consistent.

00:23:54.267 --> 00:23:55.568 align:middle line:90%
There's about a hundred

00:23:55.568 --> 00:23:57.737 align:middle line:84%
and thirty four floods notes
sharing exactly identical

00:23:57.737 --> 00:23:58.905 align:middle line:90%
information by cultures

00:23:58.905 --> 00:24:01.107 align:middle line:84%
that supposedly never
spoke to each other.

00:24:01.107 --> 00:24:02.375 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:24:02.375 --> 00:24:03.643 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: And this is beyond
the biblical information.

00:24:03.643 --> 00:24:06.512 align:middle line:84%
This is-this goes through
India, goes through Egypt,

00:24:06.512 --> 00:24:08.080 align:middle line:90%
Central America, everywhere;

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.116 align:middle line:84%
even the Northern culture
has the same story.

00:24:10.116 --> 00:24:11.817 align:middle line:84%
And they're all get
different names;

00:24:11.817 --> 00:24:14.787 align:middle line:84%
it could be Noah,
or Manu, or Zuzudra.

00:24:14.787 --> 00:24:17.723 align:middle line:84%
They all have different names,
but every single text says

00:24:17.723 --> 00:24:20.693 align:middle line:84%
that within these arks
there were seven sages

00:24:20.693 --> 00:24:22.261 align:middle line:90%
that survived the flood.

00:24:22.261 --> 00:24:24.130 align:middle line:84%
They all knew the
knowledge of temple building;

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.599 align:middle line:84%
they all knew how to
locate the hotspots,

00:24:26.599 --> 00:24:29.569 align:middle line:84%
and after the flood receded,
they were to go to talk about,

00:24:29.569 --> 00:24:33.339 align:middle line:84%
build primordial mounts that
locate the center of energy

00:24:33.339 --> 00:24:36.943 align:middle line:84%
around the earth, and then these
mounts would form the basis

00:24:36.943 --> 00:24:39.679 align:middle line:84%
of the future historic temples,
the ones that we see today.

00:24:39.679 --> 00:24:42.815 align:middle line:84%
We're talking of an expand
of eight thousand years.

00:24:42.815 --> 00:24:44.016 align:middle line:90%
It's a/ long time.

00:24:44.016 --> 00:24:45.217 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:24:45.217 --> 00:24:46.652 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: But the results are
that they were supposed

00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:48.854 align:middle line:84%
to build these temples
as an insurance policy

00:24:48.854 --> 00:24:52.558 align:middle line:84%
for future times when humanity
would again lose the plots

00:24:52.558 --> 00:24:54.026 align:middle line:90%
with the natural world.

00:24:54.026 --> 00:24:55.428 align:middle line:84%
They would stop looking
at the stars,

00:24:55.428 --> 00:24:58.197 align:middle line:84%
and observing the environment
around, and they would succumb

00:24:58.197 --> 00:25:00.466 align:middle line:84%
to the environment
without being prepared.

00:25:00.466 --> 00:25:01.834 align:middle line:90%
Sounds familiar?

00:25:01.834 --> 00:25:03.769 align:middle line:84%
So this time is upon
us yet again.

00:25:03.769 --> 00:25:06.072 align:middle line:84%
We are so enamored with
the electronic culture

00:25:06.072 --> 00:25:07.640 align:middle line:84%
that we are losing
that time again,

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.742 align:middle line:90%
and ironically we fill the pull

00:25:09.742 --> 00:25:11.410 align:middle line:84%
to go back the sacred
sites again.

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.213 align:middle line:84%
Our tendencies are growing yet
again for people who want to go

00:25:14.213 --> 00:25:16.282 align:middle line:84%
to Stonehenge, or
to the Pyramids,

00:25:16.282 --> 00:25:19.185 align:middle line:84%
and some of them don't know
why; they do it as tourists,

00:25:19.185 --> 00:25:22.355 align:middle line:84%
but some do feel a need, an
innate need to communicate

00:25:22.355 --> 00:25:25.491 align:middle line:84%
with another level of reality,
an intuitive feeling to connect

00:25:25.491 --> 00:25:28.127 align:middle line:84%
with something much
deeper, which precisely--

00:25:28.127 --> 00:25:28.694 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's [inaudible]

00:25:28.694 --> 00:25:29.895 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Exactly.

00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:30.963 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: OK, speaking of
that, which has been lost.

00:25:30.963 --> 00:25:33.065 align:middle line:84%
Now, where does the
Atlantic culture

00:25:33.065 --> 00:25:35.167 align:middle line:90%
and legend play into this?

00:25:35.167 --> 00:25:39.071 align:middle line:84%
Because in many rendering
[inaudible] roughly the exact

00:25:39.071 --> 00:25:40.439 align:middle line:90%
same time period.

00:25:40.439 --> 00:25:42.308 align:middle line:84%
We're talking exactly twelve
thousand five hundred years ago

00:25:42.308 --> 00:25:45.244 align:middle line:84%
where those people-there
was advanced warning;

00:25:45.244 --> 00:25:47.813 align:middle line:84%
it didn't happen in
a flash apparently.

00:25:47.813 --> 00:25:50.783 align:middle line:84%
Those people were able
to migrate elsewhere.

00:25:50.783 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Exactly.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.485 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And a lot

00:25:52.485 --> 00:25:55.855 align:middle line:84%
of the knowledge-do the
seven sages ever come

00:25:55.855 --> 00:25:57.923 align:middle line:84%
up as having a historic
background

00:25:57.923 --> 00:26:00.292 align:middle line:84%
into Atlantic times
and beyond maybe?

00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:02.361 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Apparently
because wherever you go

00:26:02.361 --> 00:26:04.730 align:middle line:84%
around the world, all of these
people appeared to have come

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.132 align:middle line:90%
from a sinking island.

00:26:06.132 --> 00:26:09.301 align:middle line:84%
They all inhabited islands; they
were sea [inaudible] culture,

00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:12.405 align:middle line:84%
and they came aboard to
either East of Island

00:26:12.405 --> 00:26:15.341 align:middle line:84%
or Egypt-excuse me,
Southern India.

00:26:15.341 --> 00:26:16.475 align:middle line:90%
What is there?

00:26:16.475 --> 00:26:18.277 align:middle line:84%
Portugal, the Atlantic
islands around Britain.

00:26:18.277 --> 00:26:21.147 align:middle line:84%
It's the same story, same
people, very, very tall;

00:26:21.147 --> 00:26:24.083 align:middle line:84%
sometimes of reddish hair;
they survived the sinking land,

00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:26.385 align:middle line:84%
and they brought over the
culture of the cosmos,

00:26:26.385 --> 00:26:28.087 align:middle line:84%
agriculture, landing,
everything.

00:26:28.087 --> 00:26:29.789 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Mathematics,
Geometry, everything.

00:26:29.789 --> 00:26:31.557 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: All things that we
take for granted today.

00:26:31.557 --> 00:26:32.792 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:26:32.792 --> 00:26:34.193 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: So they were very
much incorporated into each

00:26:34.193 --> 00:26:37.663 align:middle line:84%
of the mist of the seven
continents, without question,

00:26:37.663 --> 00:26:39.065 align:middle line:90%
and they were very grateful.

00:26:39.065 --> 00:26:41.667 align:middle line:84%
The [inaudible] must have been
told they couldn't agree no more

00:26:41.667 --> 00:26:42.902 align:middle line:90%
humans, of course.

00:26:42.902 --> 00:26:45.371 align:middle line:84%
Eventually they die out
over the course of time,

00:26:45.371 --> 00:26:47.373 align:middle line:84%
and they native American
cultures talk

00:26:47.373 --> 00:26:49.575 align:middle line:84%
about meeting the remnants
of when they were crossing

00:26:49.575 --> 00:26:51.744 align:middle line:84%
over the land bridge across
the plains [inaudible]

00:26:51.744 --> 00:26:56.916 align:middle line:84%
when they first moved over
to Central North America.

00:26:56.916 --> 00:26:58.684 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't too long ago.

00:26:58.684 --> 00:27:03.456 align:middle line:84%
And the Appalachia, the Cherokee
remember meeting the tall-people

00:27:03.456 --> 00:27:04.690 align:middle line:90%
called the Alaguani [phonetic]

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.860 align:middle line:84%
which of course would get
the name Allegheny from,

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.128 align:middle line:90%
the Allegheny River.

00:27:09.128 --> 00:27:11.197 align:middle line:84%
So it's immortalized
in Cherokee cultures,

00:27:11.197 --> 00:27:14.600 align:middle line:84%
where all these people, who
were very enlightened people,

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.969 align:middle line:84%
they called them, they
survived the catastrophe

00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:19.205 align:middle line:84%
and they brought all the
culture, but after a while

00:27:19.205 --> 00:27:20.673 align:middle line:84%
through inbreeding
because they couldn't breed

00:27:20.673 --> 00:27:23.209 align:middle line:84%
with anybody else, they
eventually became brutish

00:27:23.209 --> 00:27:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and died off, and
[inaudible]everywhere.

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.646 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You have a
wonderful example of that,

00:27:27.646 --> 00:27:30.516 align:middle line:90%
one of the photos in the book,

00:27:30.516 --> 00:27:33.619 align:middle line:84%
a skeleton-I believe it
was of fifteen feet tall.

00:27:33.619 --> 00:27:34.387 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Yes.

00:27:34.387 --> 00:27:35.554 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: The remnants of it.

00:27:35.554 --> 00:27:38.057 align:middle line:84%
Now, remind me where-where
was that one found?

00:27:38.057 --> 00:27:39.625 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Well, back
in the Victorian era

00:27:39.625 --> 00:27:42.595 align:middle line:84%
when I was [inaudible] impressed
by [inaudible] giant graves

00:27:42.595 --> 00:27:45.064 align:middle line:84%
in Great Britain-I
mean, there's thousands

00:27:45.064 --> 00:27:46.198 align:middle line:90%
of them, even in the maps.

00:27:46.198 --> 00:27:48.868 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, Scotland,
Ireland, England, yes.

00:27:48.868 --> 00:27:49.702 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: [inaudible]
I used to there

00:27:49.702 --> 00:27:51.670 align:middle line:90%
and have my tea the afternoon.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.038 align:middle line:90%
I live there.

00:27:53.038 --> 00:27:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And that died up and [inaudible]
in Ireland, and they found,

00:27:57.910 --> 00:27:59.145 align:middle line:90%
not just the skeleton;

00:27:59.145 --> 00:28:02.148 align:middle line:84%
they found the meat actually
fossilized on the bones

00:28:02.148 --> 00:28:03.816 align:middle line:90%
with the skin still attached.

00:28:03.816 --> 00:28:05.785 align:middle line:84%
And there is a wonderful
photograph that was published

00:28:05.785 --> 00:28:08.554 align:middle line:84%
in a Australian magazine in
eighteen ninety five, I believe,

00:28:08.554 --> 00:28:12.024 align:middle line:84%
which shows the entire person
propped up in [inaudible]

00:28:12.024 --> 00:28:14.026 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's the one you
have in your book, yeah.

00:28:14.026 --> 00:28:14.994 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing photograph.

00:28:14.994 --> 00:28:16.195 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: It is an amazing
photograph,

00:28:16.195 --> 00:28:18.297 align:middle line:84%
and the [inaudible] well,
they go off to lunch.

00:28:18.297 --> 00:28:20.332 align:middle line:84%
Well, the pub as
we do in Britain.

00:28:20.332 --> 00:28:23.769 align:middle line:84%
And they come back and this
fifteen foot guy disappears,

00:28:23.769 --> 00:28:25.771 align:middle line:90%
never to be seen again.

00:28:25.771 --> 00:28:29.241 align:middle line:84%
Just like the skeleton is in
North America, the Smithsonian,

00:28:29.241 --> 00:28:30.609 align:middle line:84%
you never get to
hear about again.

00:28:30.609 --> 00:28:32.378 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: No, they're gone,
just like the treasures

00:28:32.378 --> 00:28:36.315 align:middle line:84%
in the Grand Canyon, waste
away hundred years ago, gone,

00:28:36.315 --> 00:28:37.583 align:middle line:90%
never heard them again.

00:28:37.583 --> 00:28:40.886 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian bootie of
magnificent proportions

00:28:40.886 --> 00:28:42.788 align:middle line:90%
in the American Grand Canyon.

00:28:42.788 --> 00:28:44.924 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Yes, I'm not a
conspiracy theorist, but-

00:28:44.924 --> 00:28:47.193 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, those organizations
don't seem to be telling us;

00:28:47.193 --> 00:28:49.929 align:middle line:84%
giving us the best of
their scientific knowledge.

00:28:49.929 --> 00:28:51.797 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's go to some
of the power spots.

00:28:51.797 --> 00:28:53.632 align:middle line:84%
Before we get into
the structures,

00:28:53.632 --> 00:28:57.236 align:middle line:84%
some of the natural powers
spots that are also in viewed

00:28:57.236 --> 00:29:00.239 align:middle line:84%
with great entity, such as
Mount Artnatural [phonetic]

00:29:00.239 --> 00:29:02.675 align:middle line:84%
and I bring it up
because I love that place.

00:29:02.675 --> 00:29:04.109 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Oh, Ronachela [phonetic]

00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, you say it right.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.512 align:middle line:90%
I say it the Western way.

00:29:06.512 --> 00:29:08.647 align:middle line:84%
>> RS: There is something
about the Indian accent.

00:29:08.647 --> 00:29:09.949 align:middle line:90%
I just makes you really happy.

00:29:09.949 --> 00:29:11.283 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, it does.

00:29:11.283 --> 00:29:13.953 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Arunachala It just
makes you feel good saying it.

00:29:13.953 --> 00:29:15.454 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:29:15.454 --> 00:29:19.124 align:middle line:84%
It's-Arunachala is one of the
original navels of the earth

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:22.862 align:middle line:84%
in its [inaudible] culture
in all the sacred text,

00:29:22.862 --> 00:29:24.964 align:middle line:84%
and they describe it as the
place of the first occasion

00:29:24.964 --> 00:29:29.068 align:middle line:84%
in Indian terms, where just
before the major catastrophe

00:29:29.068 --> 00:29:32.204 align:middle line:84%
happened when India did lose
a huge amount of land mass,

00:29:32.204 --> 00:29:35.374 align:middle line:90%
and this is validated,

00:29:35.374 --> 00:29:37.509 align:middle line:84%
the [inaudible] addresses
the people.

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:40.446 align:middle line:84%
The templar says, "We need
to take the knowledge.

00:29:40.446 --> 00:29:41.413 align:middle line:90%
We need to hide it."

00:29:41.413 --> 00:29:42.882 align:middle line:90%
And they hid it in Arunachala

00:29:42.882 --> 00:29:46.552 align:middle line:84%
where Lingan [inaudible] would
represent my culture power.

00:29:46.552 --> 00:29:48.687 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there is
today a [inaudible] stone,

00:29:48.687 --> 00:29:52.157 align:middle line:84%
the very brave stone, which
marks the navel of earth,

00:29:52.157 --> 00:29:53.158 align:middle line:90%
where they actually [inaudible]

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:54.393 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And in the
temple down below,

00:29:54.393 --> 00:29:56.028 align:middle line:90%
same thing, ceremonies each day.

00:29:56.028 --> 00:29:58.297 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: And that's where
the [inaudible] of energies

00:29:58.297 --> 00:30:01.500 align:middle line:84%
of the [inaudible] of the
creators god, actually resides,

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.701 align:middle line:90%
and it's from there,

00:30:02.701 --> 00:30:04.436 align:middle line:84%
if you actually take some
high sensitive equipment

00:30:04.436 --> 00:30:07.006 align:middle line:84%
that you would find,
is highly magnetized.

00:30:07.006 --> 00:30:08.774 align:middle line:84%
There's something about
the location of all

00:30:08.774 --> 00:30:11.744 align:middle line:84%
of these [inaudible] stones,
these navels of the earth,

00:30:11.744 --> 00:30:13.979 align:middle line:84%
with the laws of physics
slightly different

00:30:13.979 --> 00:30:15.581 align:middle line:90%
from the landscape around you.

00:30:15.581 --> 00:30:16.882 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:30:16.882 --> 00:30:18.183 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: And we now know that
those slight differences,

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:21.553 align:middle line:84%
those that interfere with
your brain way patterns,

00:30:21.553 --> 00:30:23.889 align:middle line:84%
which is why you start getting
in these shamanic states.

00:30:23.889 --> 00:30:24.957 align:middle line:84%
>> FM: Absolutely,
and [inaudible]

00:30:24.957 --> 00:30:26.425 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Where you get
your knowledge from.

00:30:26.425 --> 00:30:30.062 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, and we have this
old film; probably five,

00:30:30.062 --> 00:30:33.065 align:middle line:84%
six decades old, old film
of the people in the town,

00:30:33.065 --> 00:30:37.303 align:middle line:84%
the pilgrimages that had been
going on for thousands of years,

00:30:37.303 --> 00:30:41.640 align:middle line:84%
where once a month a particular
phase of the moon people come

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.576 align:middle line:84%
from all over and
circumnavigate the mountain

00:30:44.576 --> 00:30:47.713 align:middle line:84%
and that's-that still goes
on today; so you have kind

00:30:47.713 --> 00:30:51.116 align:middle line:84%
of an odd collection-I mean,
the town still dirt streets

00:30:51.116 --> 00:30:55.854 align:middle line:84%
and there is this magnificent
temple there, as you can see.

00:30:55.854 --> 00:30:58.958 align:middle line:90%
And-and yet at the same time,

00:30:58.958 --> 00:31:01.427 align:middle line:84%
now that there's been a
little bit of civilization,

00:31:01.427 --> 00:31:02.861 align:middle line:84%
and there is quite
a lot of garbage.

00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:04.763 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it has some of
those elements to it just

00:31:04.763 --> 00:31:07.433 align:middle line:84%
because there is no
infrastructure for picking

00:31:07.433 --> 00:31:09.435 align:middle line:84%
up garbage, but that
little thing aside,

00:31:09.435 --> 00:31:11.971 align:middle line:84%
it has the most magnificent
energies.

00:31:11.971 --> 00:31:13.238 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Yes, it does.

00:31:13.238 --> 00:31:15.874 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And the famous
Majoriche Ramenaude [phonetic],

00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:21.547 align:middle line:84%
the Majoriche [phonetic] spent
years, decades in those caves,

00:31:21.547 --> 00:31:27.586 align:middle line:84%
and was highly revered, I think,
as one of the more-I found it

00:31:27.586 --> 00:31:30.522 align:middle line:84%
to be one of the more refined
Majoriches [phonetic] of the day

00:31:30.522 --> 00:31:32.257 align:middle line:90%
on terms of his knowledge,

00:31:32.257 --> 00:31:34.226 align:middle line:84%
and have you been
in those caves too?

00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:34.994 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: No, I haven't.

00:31:34.994 --> 00:31:36.128 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, they're lovely.

00:31:36.128 --> 00:31:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: I have a problem
with humidity and heat.

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.298 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, you would hate it.

00:31:39.298 --> 00:31:40.532 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you would hate it.

00:31:40.532 --> 00:31:42.101 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: I only know it by
people's eyewitness accounts

00:31:42.101 --> 00:31:43.135 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of them, thank heaven.

00:31:43.135 --> 00:31:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, there are a lot.

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:46.705 align:middle line:84%
I had a very strange
experience one day coming down.

00:31:46.705 --> 00:31:48.107 align:middle line:90%
I saw things in the cave.

00:31:48.107 --> 00:31:49.708 align:middle line:84%
It was wonderful
being in the cave

00:31:49.708 --> 00:31:51.744 align:middle line:84%
and just getting a little
reflective information

00:31:51.744 --> 00:31:55.014 align:middle line:84%
about your own being, but
walking down one day-It's one

00:31:55.014 --> 00:31:56.682 align:middle line:90%
like you're funny-not funny,

00:31:56.682 --> 00:31:58.984 align:middle line:84%
but profound experience
in the pyramid.

00:31:58.984 --> 00:32:00.352 align:middle line:90%
I was going down the hall,

00:32:00.352 --> 00:32:03.022 align:middle line:84%
walking through the ashmour
[phonetic] at the base of it;

00:32:03.022 --> 00:32:07.126 align:middle line:84%
that is where everyone
goes for Pugi [phonetic ]

00:32:07.126 --> 00:32:09.495 align:middle line:84%
this day, and I walked
through this room by myself

00:32:09.495 --> 00:32:12.865 align:middle line:84%
and had a portrait of
Romanade [phonetic] there ,

00:32:12.865 --> 00:32:17.069 align:middle line:84%
and as I walked by,
he winked at me.

00:32:17.069 --> 00:32:19.004 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, "Oh, come on."

00:32:19.004 --> 00:32:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So I was like doing this,
blinking and thinking,

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.509 align:middle line:90%
"OK, I just meditate."

00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:26.378 align:middle line:84%
And I looked back, and when
I went, it blinked again.

00:32:26.378 --> 00:32:27.513 align:middle line:90%
Didn't think much it.

00:32:27.513 --> 00:32:29.648 align:middle line:84%
I thought, "I'm imagining
it."At the end

00:32:29.648 --> 00:32:32.351 align:middle line:84%
of the trip this young
guy comes up and says,

00:32:32.351 --> 00:32:33.685 align:middle line:90%
"That freaked me out, man.

00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:37.723 align:middle line:84%
I walked passed that portrait,
and the guy winked at me."

00:32:37.723 --> 00:32:39.024 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: And it doesn't
surprise me.

00:32:39.024 --> 00:32:40.325 align:middle line:90%
I hear this all the time.

00:32:40.325 --> 00:32:42.161 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, these things
can happen in these places.

00:32:42.161 --> 00:32:43.495 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Yes, I mean,
I've been to a place

00:32:43.495 --> 00:32:48.534 align:middle line:84%
where I kidnapped a famous
psychic in England to get away

00:32:48.534 --> 00:32:52.137 align:middle line:84%
from work just to sort of
have a normal day outing,

00:32:52.137 --> 00:32:54.773 align:middle line:84%
and another friend of mine
was also a very good psychic

00:32:54.773 --> 00:32:58.577 align:middle line:84%
and an accountant, so a good use
of left brain and right brain.

00:32:58.577 --> 00:33:01.447 align:middle line:84%
And we went to this
beautiful church in Conwell

00:33:01.447 --> 00:33:04.416 align:middle line:84%
and with decided that we'll get
back to work and do a little bit

00:33:04.416 --> 00:33:05.784 align:middle line:90%
of honoring of the sacred site.

00:33:05.784 --> 00:33:08.921 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we start
chanting, the lights go off,

00:33:08.921 --> 00:33:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and then as we're walking
out-oh, no, before we began,

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:14.393 align:middle line:84%
he says to me, "Well, who
should we dedicate this to?"

00:33:14.393 --> 00:33:16.762 align:middle line:84%
I said-I was very
[inaudible] I was very flipping

00:33:16.762 --> 00:33:17.763 align:middle line:90%
in my head, St. Cecilia.

00:33:17.763 --> 00:33:20.099 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "That's
a good choice."

00:33:20.099 --> 00:33:21.834 align:middle line:84%
Surely there is no one
called St. Cecilia.

00:33:21.834 --> 00:33:22.868 align:middle line:90%
I just made that up.

00:33:22.868 --> 00:33:24.303 align:middle line:84%
No, that's a patron
[inaudible] music.

00:33:24.303 --> 00:33:26.872 align:middle line:90%
I said, "OK."

00:33:26.872 --> 00:33:28.841 align:middle line:84%
And [inaudible] Michael, my
other friend dedicates it

00:33:28.841 --> 00:33:31.510 align:middle line:84%
to Gabriel, and afterwards
we're walking out, and I looked

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:33.078 align:middle line:84%
over this stained glass
window and I said,

00:33:33.078 --> 00:33:34.680 align:middle line:90%
"Wouldn't you believe.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.181 align:middle line:90%
We picked the three entities

00:33:36.181 --> 00:33:39.184 align:middle line:84%
that we dedicate this chanting
to, and look at the people

00:33:39.184 --> 00:33:42.387 align:middle line:84%
who are actually portrait
in the three windows."

00:33:42.387 --> 00:33:43.789 align:middle line:90%
And we read this forever,

00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:45.657 align:middle line:84%
and next day we went
back with someone else.

00:33:45.657 --> 00:33:46.825 align:middle line:90%
I told them the story.

00:33:46.825 --> 00:33:49.094 align:middle line:84%
We went back in, and
there is no stained glass.

00:33:49.094 --> 00:33:51.663 align:middle line:84%
The priests swears that there
has never been stained glass

00:33:51.663 --> 00:33:53.065 align:middle line:90%
in that building.

00:33:53.065 --> 00:33:55.601 align:middle line:84%
The local historian who knows
everything about Conwell says,

00:33:55.601 --> 00:33:58.337 align:middle line:84%
"What were you on because there
has never been stained glass

00:33:58.337 --> 00:34:01.039 align:middle line:84%
in there."And we told this
to our psychic friend,

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:03.509 align:middle line:84%
and she goes, "You know that
happened around me a lot.

00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:06.311 align:middle line:84%
You obviously connected
the spirit of place.

00:34:06.311 --> 00:34:09.081 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So it's how
malleable-malleable our

00:34:09.081 --> 00:34:12.851 align:middle line:84%
perception of reality is, and
when we go into these places,

00:34:12.851 --> 00:34:14.620 align:middle line:90%
it bends quite a bit more.

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:16.421 align:middle line:90%
Reality is much, more flexible.

00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:18.824 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some of
the sacred sites themselves.

00:34:18.824 --> 00:34:21.325 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you mentioned
Saqqara [phonetic] a little

00:34:21.325 --> 00:34:22.394 align:middle line:90%
bit ago.

00:34:22.394 --> 00:34:24.763 align:middle line:84%
Talk about the dynamics
playing in there.

00:34:24.763 --> 00:34:27.399 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately we're not going
to have a chance to go into all

00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:30.936 align:middle line:84%
of the principles that are at
work, but if you could touch

00:34:30.936 --> 00:34:34.139 align:middle line:84%
on some at least one in each
of these, that would be great.

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:36.141 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Sure, Saqqara
[inaudible] was a city

00:34:36.141 --> 00:34:38.276 align:middle line:90%
of knowledge in its own right.

00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:41.412 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the pyramids-the
auxiliary pyramid were actually

00:34:41.412 --> 00:34:44.082 align:middle line:84%
use this ritual chambers,
where people

00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:47.553 align:middle line:84%
who were either indoctrinated
in the mysteries

00:34:47.553 --> 00:34:50.155 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge would go and
spend evenings in there.

00:34:50.155 --> 00:34:52.958 align:middle line:84%
They'd be reawakened by,
they would be resurrected

00:34:52.958 --> 00:34:54.959 align:middle line:84%
from the dead, they'd
be totally aware

00:34:54.959 --> 00:34:57.095 align:middle line:84%
of what's going on
in the universe.

00:34:57.095 --> 00:35:01.233 align:middle line:84%
It has the entrance into
it-there is a particular saying

00:35:01.233 --> 00:35:04.169 align:middle line:84%
in one of the pyramids that-and
it's very curious saying.

00:35:04.169 --> 00:35:09.274 align:middle line:84%
It says, "Seven degrees-seven
gates allows you entrance

00:35:09.274 --> 00:35:12.010 align:middle line:84%
from earth into heaven."And
after doing a little bit

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:13.912 align:middle line:84%
of energy work at the
entrance of Saqqara,

00:35:13.912 --> 00:35:17.849 align:middle line:84%
I found exactly seven notes
along the way the passage way.

00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:19.084 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, interesting.

00:35:19.084 --> 00:35:21.386 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: That supposedly
challenge the magnetic point

00:35:21.386 --> 00:35:24.189 align:middle line:84%
that you add this
[inaudible] before you walk in.

00:35:24.189 --> 00:35:27.326 align:middle line:84%
So it's a preparatory hallway
where each time you get hit

00:35:27.326 --> 00:35:28.894 align:middle line:90%
by this energy, you get a chance

00:35:28.894 --> 00:35:31.096 align:middle line:84%
to stay [inaudible] your
thoughts and your feelings.

00:35:31.096 --> 00:35:33.398 align:middle line:84%
If they're negative, through
them in the garbage bin

00:35:33.398 --> 00:35:36.668 align:middle line:84%
because all that stuff is now
electromagnetic, as we now know.

00:35:36.668 --> 00:35:40.005 align:middle line:84%
You take those impurities into
the pure temple of the gods,

00:35:40.005 --> 00:35:42.641 align:middle line:84%
you're going to basically
create a downfall of the temple

00:35:42.641 --> 00:35:45.043 align:middle line:84%
because it's-the temple is
supposed to be a mirror image.

00:35:45.043 --> 00:35:47.012 align:middle line:84%
Everything is perfect
in the universe,

00:35:47.012 --> 00:35:49.581 align:middle line:84%
the actual physical
body of creating being.

00:35:49.581 --> 00:35:51.717 align:middle line:84%
So, if you take the
negativity there, you're going

00:35:51.717 --> 00:35:55.320 align:middle line:84%
to create a downfall of
temple that you try to repair.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.123 align:middle line:84%
So that's just Saqqara,
one of the basic levels.

00:35:58.123 --> 00:35:59.458 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of levels-

00:35:59.458 --> 00:36:00.959 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So we're talking about
the electromagnetic there;

00:36:00.959 --> 00:36:03.695 align:middle line:84%
also water as a common
factor, correct?

00:36:03.695 --> 00:36:04.896 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Absolutely.

00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:06.965 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: The veins of water
running underneath these

00:36:06.965 --> 00:36:10.135 align:middle line:84%
temples, which, of course, carry
electromagnetic current as well.

00:36:10.135 --> 00:36:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Exactly, without
exception,

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:14.239 align:middle line:84%
and the-even archeologists
back in the thirties,

00:36:14.239 --> 00:36:17.476 align:middle line:84%
[inaudible] of every single
living space, without exception,

00:36:17.476 --> 00:36:19.344 align:middle line:84%
is built on top of
a veins of water.

00:36:19.344 --> 00:36:23.715 align:middle line:84%
Even the Navajo water, even
the [inaudible] valley, which,

00:36:23.715 --> 00:36:25.417 align:middle line:84%
as we know, is a
very good desert.

00:36:25.417 --> 00:36:27.185 align:middle line:90%
I have seen it with my own eyes.

00:36:27.185 --> 00:36:29.588 align:middle line:84%
There is a crystal
clear spring running

00:36:29.588 --> 00:36:32.357 align:middle line:84%
between two great sand
dunes next to a Juniper tree

00:36:32.357 --> 00:36:34.092 align:middle line:84%
that you can't see
from the desert floor.

00:36:34.092 --> 00:36:38.563 align:middle line:84%
You have to be in a very good
position of luck, to be guided

00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:42.301 align:middle line:84%
by the right person, and his
name is Leroy; he is Navajo.

00:36:42.301 --> 00:36:43.502 align:middle line:90%
There is a story behind that.

00:36:43.502 --> 00:36:44.736 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: I'm sure there is.

00:36:44.736 --> 00:36:47.973 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Involving [inaudible]
there is a good humor

00:36:47.973 --> 00:36:49.775 align:middle line:90%
to all of this.

00:36:49.775 --> 00:36:51.943 align:middle line:84%
And there is; even in
the middle of the desert,

00:36:51.943 --> 00:36:54.379 align:middle line:84%
water is fundamental, and
now we know from science

00:36:54.379 --> 00:36:56.515 align:middle line:84%
that water attracts
lines of energy,

00:36:56.515 --> 00:36:59.384 align:middle line:84%
and that's actually
admitted it as well.

00:36:59.384 --> 00:37:01.253 align:middle line:84%
And when the two
attract each other,

00:37:01.253 --> 00:37:03.522 align:middle line:84%
they create an electromagnetic
charge,

00:37:03.522 --> 00:37:06.692 align:middle line:84%
and that begins the process
where if you interacted,

00:37:06.692 --> 00:37:09.127 align:middle line:84%
and of course, you made
[inaudible] of water,

00:37:09.127 --> 00:37:10.696 align:middle line:90%
you're an electromagnetic being,

00:37:10.696 --> 00:37:13.665 align:middle line:84%
so the two fundamental
principles of any circuit base,

00:37:13.665 --> 00:37:15.534 align:middle line:90%
water and electromagnetism,

00:37:15.534 --> 00:37:17.936 align:middle line:84%
basically amplify a
mirror of who you are.

00:37:17.936 --> 00:37:20.172 align:middle line:84%
So, the two of you are
stepping over each other,

00:37:20.172 --> 00:37:23.375 align:middle line:84%
that moment depending on
where you are, as a person,

00:37:23.375 --> 00:37:26.812 align:middle line:84%
if you allow magic to
happen, that's when the laws

00:37:26.812 --> 00:37:30.115 align:middle line:84%
of physics start working on your
sacred heaven, shamanic moment.

00:37:30.115 --> 00:37:32.818 align:middle line:84%
Vsions star appearing, words
start coming into your head.

00:37:32.818 --> 00:37:35.520 align:middle line:84%
You think, "I think I've
gone mad," but it's not.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.090 align:middle line:84%
That's what-that's the
mechanism that they used to use

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:40.692 align:middle line:84%
and amplify to get you
to have a communication

00:37:40.692 --> 00:37:42.994 align:middle line:84%
with the unseen world, and
it can be a little annoying

00:37:42.994 --> 00:37:45.330 align:middle line:84%
and strange at first,
but you get used to it,

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.499 align:middle line:84%
and realize that it's
a very lovely energy,

00:37:47.499 --> 00:37:49.701 align:middle line:84%
very loving process
that there is behind it.

00:37:49.701 --> 00:37:51.770 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing to be
afraid of it, and the fringe

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.739 align:middle line:90%
of benefits are amazing.

00:37:53.739 --> 00:37:58.076 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, and the dynamic
you were speaking a moment ago

00:37:58.076 --> 00:38:00.846 align:middle line:84%
almost sounds like a vortex
type of energy, a spiral.

00:38:00.846 --> 00:38:02.047 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Absolutely.

00:38:02.047 --> 00:38:03.949 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Without all of
these places, which-now,

00:38:03.949 --> 00:38:06.485 align:middle line:84%
we'll get to some of the other
ones that are well known,

00:38:06.485 --> 00:38:10.655 align:middle line:84%
but also, Sedona is known
for its vortex, for example,

00:38:10.655 --> 00:38:12.958 align:middle line:90%
coming off of the sandstone,

00:38:12.958 --> 00:38:15.961 align:middle line:84%
iron [inaudible] it gives
you an opportunity to talk

00:38:15.961 --> 00:38:18.430 align:middle line:84%
about what each of
these-what certain types

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:20.632 align:middle line:90%
of stone bring to the equation.

00:38:20.632 --> 00:38:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Oh, totally.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.503 align:middle line:84%
After to twenty years of looking
at hundreds of sacred signs,

00:38:24.503 --> 00:38:26.271 align:middle line:90%
suddenly dawned on me-and again,

00:38:26.271 --> 00:38:28.073 align:middle line:84%
this is the sacred site
looking back to me.

00:38:28.073 --> 00:38:31.877 align:middle line:84%
If I'm asking the question, "How
do these things change people

00:38:31.877 --> 00:38:34.179 align:middle line:90%
from ordinary people into gods?"

00:38:34.179 --> 00:38:37.182 align:middle line:84%
And the immediate
answer, look at the rock.

00:38:37.182 --> 00:38:39.684 align:middle line:84%
Why did we bring these
rocks from hundreds of miles

00:38:39.684 --> 00:38:41.253 align:middle line:84%
from the local rock
would have done it?

00:38:41.253 --> 00:38:42.020 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:43.422 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:38:43.422 --> 00:38:45.023 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: And you look at it and
every single temple in the earth

00:38:45.023 --> 00:38:48.994 align:middle line:84%
that is dedicated to a
masculine entity is always made

00:38:48.994 --> 00:38:53.131 align:middle line:84%
with volcanic and igneous rock
because it amplifies energy

00:38:53.131 --> 00:38:55.233 align:middle line:84%
of the masculine;
it's a solar energy.

00:38:55.233 --> 00:38:58.437 align:middle line:84%
It's in your face, but all
the temples that are dedicated

00:38:58.437 --> 00:39:00.806 align:middle line:84%
to feminine deities
are the ones associated

00:39:00.806 --> 00:39:04.876 align:middle line:84%
with sedimentary stone, which
comes from the actual water.

00:39:04.876 --> 00:39:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So, sense stone, limestone,
marble, and sometimes if you are

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.383 align:middle line:84%
on a both, there is a
combination of both rocks.

00:39:11.383 --> 00:39:14.786 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of the technology
that amplifies the basic energy

00:39:14.786 --> 00:39:16.922 align:middle line:84%
that gets it to do what
it's supposed to be doing.

00:39:16.922 --> 00:39:18.356 align:middle line:84%
It's called the moral
correspondence.

00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:20.125 align:middle line:84%
The more correspondence
you have,

00:39:20.125 --> 00:39:24.496 align:middle line:84%
the more the site does what it's
intended to do, so it's a donor.

00:39:24.496 --> 00:39:28.099 align:middle line:84%
Very feminine energy, especially
at Bell Rock, and you have

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:29.868 align:middle line:84%
in Bell Rock the
greatest vortexes,

00:39:29.868 --> 00:39:32.137 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually a
navel of the earth,

00:39:32.137 --> 00:39:33.939 align:middle line:90%
sacred to the Anasasi [phonetic]

00:39:33.939 --> 00:39:36.741 align:middle line:84%
and then the Sonaya
[phonetic] the Sinaloa-

00:39:36.741 --> 00:39:37.943 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Sinahua [phonetic]

00:39:37.943 --> 00:39:40.545 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Sinahua [phonetic]
Yes, lovely people.

00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:42.781 align:middle line:84%
And there, if you're-actually
I don't encourage you

00:39:42.781 --> 00:39:44.449 align:middle line:84%
to go digging there
but if you would-

00:39:44.449 --> 00:39:45.283 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No, don't dig it.

00:39:45.283 --> 00:39:46.318 align:middle line:90%
You'll be in big trouble.

00:39:46.318 --> 00:39:47.652 align:middle line:90%
That's not far from my house.

00:39:47.652 --> 00:39:50.922 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: if you were supposed
to, which you shouldn't do,

00:39:50.922 --> 00:39:53.992 align:middle line:84%
you would find that people like
the group that I work with,

00:39:53.992 --> 00:39:57.729 align:middle line:84%
go all around the world
burying bits of earth and bits

00:39:57.729 --> 00:40:00.999 align:middle line:84%
of little stones from
their sacred sites

00:40:00.999 --> 00:40:03.568 align:middle line:90%
and taking a little bit of a-

00:40:03.568 --> 00:40:04.536 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That easy enough to do.

00:40:04.536 --> 00:40:06.037 align:middle line:84%
It's lose; it's all
over the ground.

00:40:06.037 --> 00:40:08.039 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Yeah, and you get some
lose things, and you get it back

00:40:08.039 --> 00:40:09.708 align:middle line:84%
to your sacred site, and
when you're doing it,

00:40:09.708 --> 00:40:12.143 align:middle line:84%
you're doing kind of rainbow
[inaudible] between your site

00:40:12.143 --> 00:40:14.713 align:middle line:84%
and Bell Rock and other
sites, so slowly it's

00:40:14.713 --> 00:40:17.516 align:middle line:84%
like an invisible world
wide web that you're doing,

00:40:17.516 --> 00:40:18.683 align:middle line:84%
and you're doing
this consciously,

00:40:18.683 --> 00:40:20.318 align:middle line:84%
and the more consciously
you do it,

00:40:20.318 --> 00:40:22.888 align:middle line:84%
the more you activate
these signs as well.

00:40:22.888 --> 00:40:25.357 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's a very
special place, and of course,

00:40:25.357 --> 00:40:27.792 align:middle line:84%
when it's back lit, it
looks just like an UFO.

00:40:27.792 --> 00:40:29.394 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It does, and
not to say anything

00:40:29.394 --> 00:40:31.863 align:middle line:84%
of all the other magnificent
structures, Cathedral Rock

00:40:31.863 --> 00:40:32.931 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Cathedral Rock.

00:40:32.931 --> 00:40:34.166 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Which also
has-and each one seems

00:40:34.166 --> 00:40:36.868 align:middle line:84%
to experience the energy
either flowing up or flowing

00:40:36.868 --> 00:40:40.105 align:middle line:84%
down depending how you enter
it; it could be great resistance

00:40:40.105 --> 00:40:41.873 align:middle line:84%
or it can almost
carry you up there.

00:40:41.873 --> 00:40:43.708 align:middle line:84%
Bell Rock is one
that carries you up.

00:40:43.708 --> 00:40:45.744 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Yeah, and that also
defines the-whether it's a

00:40:45.744 --> 00:40:47.078 align:middle line:90%
masculine or feminine site.

00:40:47.078 --> 00:40:49.681 align:middle line:84%
Usually when you're being sort
of allowed into something,

00:40:49.681 --> 00:40:52.584 align:middle line:84%
it's a very feminine site;
it's a protective lovely thing.

00:40:52.584 --> 00:40:54.986 align:middle line:84%
If it's pushy, it's a
masculine site; it makes sense.

00:40:54.986 --> 00:40:56.488 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, and you
experience and enormous

00:40:56.488 --> 00:40:58.256 align:middle line:90%
of the sacred rocks in Sedona.

00:40:58.256 --> 00:41:02.027 align:middle line:84%
Let's go on to Serpent
Mount-Serpent Mount in Ohio.

00:41:02.027 --> 00:41:03.395 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:03.395 --> 00:41:04.796 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Wow.

00:41:04.796 --> 00:41:08.767 align:middle line:84%
That has been the object of a
lot of study, and a good friend

00:41:08.767 --> 00:41:11.269 align:middle line:84%
of mine over there
called Jeffrey Wilson,

00:41:11.269 --> 00:41:13.972 align:middle line:84%
along with other people who
dedicate themselves to the study

00:41:13.972 --> 00:41:16.575 align:middle line:84%
of that, worked out
recently all the coils

00:41:16.575 --> 00:41:19.878 align:middle line:84%
of this magnificent serpent, all
lined to the extreme position

00:41:19.878 --> 00:41:22.414 align:middle line:84%
of the sun and the moon
over the course of a year,

00:41:22.414 --> 00:41:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and it's the first [inaudible]
that have ever been worked out.

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:27.419 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I was there,
I've gone to the mysteries

00:41:27.419 --> 00:41:28.853 align:middle line:84%
of the mysteries of the
Cherokee and they said

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:31.456 align:middle line:84%
that the Serpent Mount was one
of the sites that was built

00:41:31.456 --> 00:41:35.060 align:middle line:84%
by this tall [inaudible] people
that survived the Great Flood,

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:37.829 align:middle line:84%
that was one of their sites,
but it has been rebuilt again

00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:41.132 align:middle line:84%
and again because obviously,
it's made of earth, so obviously

00:41:41.132 --> 00:41:42.467 align:middle line:90%
over time it gets eroded.

00:41:42.467 --> 00:41:45.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's been maintained
by various people

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:47.272 align:middle line:90%
over the course of a millennia.

00:41:47.272 --> 00:41:49.307 align:middle line:84%
When I was there,
what I didn't know is

00:41:49.307 --> 00:41:51.743 align:middle line:90%
that the main hotspot energy is

00:41:51.743 --> 00:41:55.013 align:middle line:84%
where the serpent has a little
egg coming out of its mouth,

00:41:55.013 --> 00:41:58.350 align:middle line:84%
which when you look at it, it
looks just like the [inaudible]

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:01.219 align:middle line:84%
in sacred geometry,
which is the sacred womb.

00:42:01.219 --> 00:42:03.355 align:middle line:84%
It's almost telling
you what it's doing.

00:42:03.355 --> 00:42:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And you stand there, and you
suddenly start getting this

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:06.791 align:middle line:90%
feeling of [inaudible] energy.

00:42:06.791 --> 00:42:08.927 align:middle line:84%
And the more you do this, the
more you pick up this energy

00:42:08.927 --> 00:42:10.362 align:middle line:90%
without even think about it.

00:42:10.362 --> 00:42:13.031 align:middle line:84%
I [inaudible] long enough
to know where the energy is,

00:42:13.031 --> 00:42:14.866 align:middle line:84%
where it's going,
what polarity it is,

00:42:14.866 --> 00:42:17.902 align:middle line:84%
just like driving your
car, anybody can do this.

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:19.904 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at this energy,
and this [inaudible] talks back

00:42:19.904 --> 00:42:21.773 align:middle line:84%
to me and says, "If
you follow this energy

00:42:21.773 --> 00:42:25.910 align:middle line:84%
to the North Eastern quadrant of
this site, that's where the city

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:30.315 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge related to this era
was located around that time.

00:42:30.315 --> 00:42:33.184 align:middle line:84%
And I told the guys; I said,
"You know, if anybody digs

00:42:33.184 --> 00:42:35.920 align:middle line:84%
across the river over there,
there should be something there

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.822 align:middle line:84%
that is supposed to be
the most important part

00:42:37.822 --> 00:42:39.391 align:middle line:90%
of Serpent Mount."

00:42:39.391 --> 00:42:42.827 align:middle line:84%
Everybody went very
quiet, and I went, "What?"

00:42:42.827 --> 00:42:44.729 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're not supposed
to know this, but we started

00:42:44.729 --> 00:42:47.732 align:middle line:84%
to do a little bit of digging up
there, and there is major center

00:42:47.732 --> 00:42:51.403 align:middle line:84%
of [inaudible] and if I was
building this sacred site

00:42:51.403 --> 00:42:54.372 align:middle line:84%
for initiation purposes
because part of it was shamanic.

00:42:54.372 --> 00:42:56.074 align:middle line:84%
You were supposed to
be the underworld,

00:42:56.074 --> 00:42:57.909 align:middle line:84%
there would have been
a cave under the egg.

00:42:57.909 --> 00:42:59.944 align:middle line:84%
And they went very quiet
again, and they said, "Well,

00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:02.447 align:middle line:84%
not many people know
this, but there is a cave;

00:43:02.447 --> 00:43:04.582 align:middle line:84%
it's in a very dilapidated
state, and it's right

00:43:04.582 --> 00:43:06.151 align:middle line:84%
under the cliff,
which is eroded,

00:43:06.151 --> 00:43:08.620 align:middle line:84%
and it would sit right
underneath where the egg is,

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.955 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the energy
lie around and through as well.

00:43:10.955 --> 00:43:13.258 align:middle line:84%
So, if you sit there
overnight quietly

00:43:13.258 --> 00:43:14.325 align:middle line:84%
on the sense of self
depravation-

00:43:14.325 --> 00:43:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Are you allowed?

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.997 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: It's dangerous
because over the course

00:43:18.997 --> 00:43:21.299 align:middle line:84%
of about six thousand
years and earthquakes,

00:43:21.299 --> 00:43:22.634 align:middle line:90%
it's a very sensible area.

00:43:22.634 --> 00:43:23.635 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So it's stable.

00:43:23.635 --> 00:43:24.569 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: It's unstable.

00:43:24.569 --> 00:43:26.071 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't recommend it.

00:43:26.071 --> 00:43:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Let them get on with that work,
and see if they can maintain it.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.309 align:middle line:84%
Over these caves, over
these places that went

00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:33.712 align:middle line:84%
to the underworld
underneath the Great Pyramid

00:43:33.712 --> 00:43:36.414 align:middle line:84%
or the King's Chamber, they're
supposed to mimic a place

00:43:36.414 --> 00:43:38.683 align:middle line:84%
of self deprivation where
you actually will be alone

00:43:38.683 --> 00:43:39.984 align:middle line:90%
with your own thoughts,

00:43:39.984 --> 00:43:42.954 align:middle line:84%
and that's when you
get to know yourself.

00:43:42.954 --> 00:43:44.689 align:middle line:90%
It can be scary at first,

00:43:44.689 --> 00:43:45.857 align:middle line:84%
but that's when you
first start learning

00:43:45.857 --> 00:43:47.792 align:middle line:84%
about how ready you
are as a soul.

00:43:47.792 --> 00:43:48.893 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No kidding.

00:43:48.893 --> 00:43:50.695 align:middle line:84%
I had a profound
experience in a cave outside

00:43:50.695 --> 00:43:53.398 align:middle line:84%
of Jerusalem [inaudible]
John Baptist;

00:43:53.398 --> 00:43:55.600 align:middle line:84%
it was-it's allegedly
the cave where he used

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.769 align:middle line:90%
to do his journey and visioning.

00:43:57.769 --> 00:44:01.172 align:middle line:84%
Unbelievable experience; I
won't go into it, but it was one

00:44:01.172 --> 00:44:03.007 align:middle line:90%
of the main events of my life.

00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:04.676 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: And he was one of the
people that was indoctrinated

00:44:04.676 --> 00:44:06.544 align:middle line:84%
to the mysteries of
resurrection as well.

00:44:06.544 --> 00:44:07.879 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, absolutely.

00:44:07.879 --> 00:44:10.849 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was evidence in
what came through in the cave.

00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:13.818 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot more-going
back to Ohio, there are a lot

00:44:13.818 --> 00:44:15.620 align:middle line:84%
of dormants [phonetic]
there, aren't they?

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:16.454 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: A lot of mounts?

00:44:16.454 --> 00:44:17.589 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, mounts.

00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Yes, huge amount
of mounts, and again,

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:21.059 align:middle line:90%
according to the Cherokee myth,

00:44:21.059 --> 00:44:22.660 align:middle line:84%
they say that these
were originated

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:27.365 align:middle line:84%
after the-by the-the Alawani
[phonetic] and they were told

00:44:27.365 --> 00:44:28.867 align:middle line:84%
by [inaudible] while
they were still sort

00:44:28.867 --> 00:44:31.236 align:middle line:90%
of doing their homework.

00:44:31.236 --> 00:44:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:33.505 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: It's a very
sensitive area.

00:44:33.505 --> 00:44:35.774 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it looks very much
like Britain in that respect

00:44:35.774 --> 00:44:38.676 align:middle line:84%
for its number of mounts, and
all of them, without exception,

00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:42.147 align:middle line:84%
occupy magnetic hotspots, and
there's hardly anybody buried

00:44:42.147 --> 00:44:43.248 align:middle line:90%
in them, so of course,

00:44:43.248 --> 00:44:44.749 align:middle line:84%
they weren't burial
mounts to begin with.

00:44:44.749 --> 00:44:45.583 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No.

00:44:45.583 --> 00:44:46.418 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: The burials came later.

00:44:46.418 --> 00:44:47.685 align:middle line:90%
What they used to do, they used

00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:49.788 align:middle line:84%
to take shamans and
special people.

00:44:49.788 --> 00:44:52.590 align:middle line:84%
When they died, they'd put their
bones on the energy hotspot

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:55.160 align:middle line:84%
and they would cover them with
their heads facing the East

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.028 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
the sun comes up;

00:44:57.028 --> 00:45:01.499 align:middle line:84%
it's the newborn light
suggests understanding.

00:45:01.499 --> 00:45:03.835 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to put the
bones of the human body,

00:45:03.835 --> 00:45:06.438 align:middle line:84%
which had the most amount
of energy of the human body,

00:45:06.438 --> 00:45:08.673 align:middle line:84%
into these sites we
call the hotspot,

00:45:08.673 --> 00:45:11.142 align:middle line:84%
so that the person can
go into the other world,

00:45:11.142 --> 00:45:13.778 align:middle line:84%
collect information, and then
send it back to the shaman

00:45:13.778 --> 00:45:16.948 align:middle line:84%
who is living in this tribe,
so that the shaman can go, "Oh,

00:45:16.948 --> 00:45:18.550 align:middle line:84%
he's telling me that
we should prepare

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:19.818 align:middle line:90%
for a really bad winter."

00:45:19.818 --> 00:45:23.154 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the tribe
regenerated itself over time,

00:45:23.154 --> 00:45:24.789 align:middle line:84%
so for them, that
was their knowledge.

00:45:24.789 --> 00:45:27.492 align:middle line:84%
It was important for them
to keep the tribe buried,

00:45:27.492 --> 00:45:29.761 align:middle line:84%
and that should-again
it's a wonderful example

00:45:29.761 --> 00:45:33.198 align:middle line:84%
of how these sites communicate
with a natural reference library

00:45:33.198 --> 00:45:36.434 align:middle line:84%
that allow you to have control
of your immediate world.

00:45:36.434 --> 00:45:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So, that's a wonderful
spot if you're an American

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:41.039 align:middle line:84%
and you can't get off
the island, so to speak.

00:45:41.039 --> 00:45:42.507 align:middle line:90%
Ohio is a good place to go too.

00:45:42.507 --> 00:45:43.575 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Absolutely.

00:45:43.575 --> 00:45:44.709 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Sedona, there
are others as well.

00:45:44.709 --> 00:45:45.543 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: New Mexico.

00:45:45.543 --> 00:45:47.245 align:middle line:90%
>> FM: New Mexico, absolutely.

00:45:47.245 --> 00:45:50.014 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's hop across
upon the USA,

00:45:50.014 --> 00:45:52.417 align:middle line:84%
and let's take a
look at Stonehenge.

00:45:52.417 --> 00:45:54.619 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Ah, Stonehenge.

00:45:54.619 --> 00:45:55.453 align:middle line:90%
We could be there forever.

00:45:55.453 --> 00:45:57.822 align:middle line:90%
I used to live next door to it.

00:45:57.822 --> 00:46:01.492 align:middle line:84%
It's a-the big thing about
Stonehenge is that it's aligned

00:46:01.492 --> 00:46:04.128 align:middle line:84%
to the Northeast, and
back in the old day,

00:46:04.128 --> 00:46:06.331 align:middle line:84%
there used to be two
stones at the entrance,

00:46:06.331 --> 00:46:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and before the earth
sort of moved,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.536 align:middle line:84%
and it does so imperceptibly
every year,

00:46:11.536 --> 00:46:15.406 align:middle line:84%
twenty thousand years, one
degree every seventy two years.

00:46:15.406 --> 00:46:16.908 align:middle line:84%
So if you're standing
on the same spot,

00:46:16.908 --> 00:46:18.443 align:middle line:90%
the stone starts to move.

00:46:18.443 --> 00:46:21.613 align:middle line:84%
If you go back about
five thousand years,

00:46:21.613 --> 00:46:24.983 align:middle line:84%
when the sun rose at the summer
solstice, the higher position

00:46:24.983 --> 00:46:28.620 align:middle line:84%
of the light; the sun comes up
on the horizon, creates a shadow

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:31.589 align:middle line:84%
at the tip of that rock, and it
creates shadow into this bold,

00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:33.124 align:middle line:84%
and it's the center
of Stonehenge.

00:46:33.124 --> 00:46:35.793 align:middle line:84%
It's the holly grail; it's
the cup of the lasting life.

00:46:35.793 --> 00:46:38.963 align:middle line:84%
So, any sacred site that
follow that direction,

00:46:38.963 --> 00:46:40.899 align:middle line:84%
Northeast alignment with
[inaudible]north way,

00:46:40.899 --> 00:46:44.002 align:middle line:84%
those tend to be some of
the oldest places on earth,

00:46:44.002 --> 00:46:46.404 align:middle line:84%
and then they are associated
with ancestral wisdom

00:46:46.404 --> 00:46:50.108 align:middle line:84%
or ancient wisdom because when
you're facing the absolute

00:46:50.108 --> 00:46:53.311 align:middle line:84%
highest position of the
light during the solar year,

00:46:53.311 --> 00:46:55.179 align:middle line:84%
that corresponds
also to knowledge,

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:58.182 align:middle line:84%
which is also associated
with light or learning,

00:46:58.182 --> 00:47:01.119 align:middle line:90%
so places like the original spot

00:47:01.119 --> 00:47:04.656 align:middle line:84%
of [inaudible] there's Rancho de
Samaya [phonetic] in New Mexico,

00:47:04.656 --> 00:47:06.991 align:middle line:84%
which now has one of the
most Catholic churches on it,

00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:09.661 align:middle line:84%
but it's still very
powerful, a shamanic place.

00:47:09.661 --> 00:47:12.530 align:middle line:84%
All of these places like
Luxur in Egypt or light

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:14.098 align:middle line:84%
of the Northeast,
all are associated

00:47:14.098 --> 00:47:16.968 align:middle line:84%
with ancestral wisdom,
so that's where you'd go

00:47:16.968 --> 00:47:18.002 align:middle line:84%
if you were looking
for that kind

00:47:18.002 --> 00:47:19.570 align:middle line:90%
of information to these sites.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:20.939 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Stonehenge.

00:47:20.939 --> 00:47:22.607 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Yes, and then, of course,
so you got the best calendar

00:47:22.607 --> 00:47:25.043 align:middle line:84%
in the world, or the
holes that are a big found

00:47:25.043 --> 00:47:27.879 align:middle line:84%
around Stonehenge,
it's been calibrated.

00:47:27.879 --> 00:47:30.114 align:middle line:84%
A good friend of mine called
Robert Hage [phonetic] If you're

00:47:30.114 --> 00:47:32.817 align:middle line:84%
into numbers, he's
the one to go for.

00:47:32.817 --> 00:47:34.252 align:middle line:90%
He would dig your head into.

00:47:34.252 --> 00:47:36.220 align:middle line:84%
It's brilliant work
because he finally worked

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.588 align:middle line:90%
out that the holes

00:47:37.588 --> 00:47:41.125 align:middle line:84%
around Stonehenge absolutely
calibrate every nineteen years

00:47:41.125 --> 00:47:44.929 align:middle line:84%
the mitotic cycle, which is when
the sun and the moon sink up.

00:47:44.929 --> 00:47:46.464 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You explain
that well in your book.

00:47:46.464 --> 00:47:47.699 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: And it's beautiful.

00:47:47.699 --> 00:47:49.734 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of work,
but once you understand it,

00:47:49.734 --> 00:47:51.469 align:middle line:90%
it's easy to get.

00:47:51.469 --> 00:47:55.573 align:middle line:84%
So [inaudible] So, again, it's
used for a second function.

00:47:55.573 --> 00:47:59.377 align:middle line:84%
It also is so powerful
because it also- the position

00:47:59.377 --> 00:48:02.647 align:middle line:84%
of the circles and the
[inaudible] stones incorporate

00:48:02.647 --> 00:48:06.751 align:middle line:84%
just every single facet of
sacred geometry that there is.

00:48:06.751 --> 00:48:08.553 align:middle line:84%
So depending on what
you're going there to do,

00:48:08.553 --> 00:48:12.523 align:middle line:84%
you would awaken a certain part
of the temple that is consistent

00:48:12.523 --> 00:48:16.094 align:middle line:84%
with the specific geometry that
is aligned with your intent.

00:48:16.094 --> 00:48:18.096 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's really important
because instead of thinking,

00:48:18.096 --> 00:48:20.331 align:middle line:84%
"Gee, what can I get
out of this place?"

00:48:20.331 --> 00:48:21.632 align:middle line:84%
We need to look into
what we can put

00:48:21.632 --> 00:48:24.635 align:middle line:84%
into the places first
as we approach them.

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:28.339 align:middle line:84%
What can we put in, give
something before you take.

00:48:28.339 --> 00:48:30.074 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Just like the
native Americans would sort

00:48:30.074 --> 00:48:32.043 align:middle line:84%
of give a little bit of
tobacco when they went

00:48:32.043 --> 00:48:33.211 align:middle line:90%
to talk to their ancestors.

00:48:33.211 --> 00:48:34.178 align:middle line:90%
It's a symbolic thing.

00:48:34.178 --> 00:48:35.313 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:48:35.313 --> 00:48:36.681 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Yeah, it's always
good to leave something

00:48:36.681 --> 00:48:39.584 align:middle line:84%
of yourself behind, so that
the next person can also drink

00:48:39.584 --> 00:48:41.252 align:middle line:84%
from it because when
you get to these places,

00:48:41.252 --> 00:48:43.988 align:middle line:84%
you are to a degree drinking
of the energy of the people

00:48:43.988 --> 00:48:46.290 align:middle line:84%
that have gone before,
and sometimes people go

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:48.926 align:middle line:84%
to these places to do silly
things, so people like me have

00:48:48.926 --> 00:48:51.562 align:middle line:84%
to go there and clean it up;
and then people come along,

00:48:51.562 --> 00:48:53.631 align:middle line:84%
and they wreck it, and
then I come back again,

00:48:53.631 --> 00:48:56.234 align:middle line:84%
but this is how things are;
things get a little bit squeeze

00:48:56.234 --> 00:48:58.403 align:middle line:84%
in the earth and we
have to try to fix it,

00:48:58.403 --> 00:48:59.637 align:middle line:90%
and that's the way of things.

00:48:59.637 --> 00:49:02.306 align:middle line:84%
So, depending on what you're
there to do-let's say,

00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:04.409 align:middle line:84%
on Monday you're there
as a-you go to work

00:49:04.409 --> 00:49:06.310 align:middle line:84%
with a divine feminine-the
geometry

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:09.647 align:middle line:84%
for the divine feminine is the
pentagram, so only the parts

00:49:09.647 --> 00:49:12.884 align:middle line:84%
of Stonehenge which are designed
according to that geometry,

00:49:12.884 --> 00:49:15.653 align:middle line:84%
and it's in there,
would come alive.

00:49:15.653 --> 00:49:17.855 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the stone is just
a bunch of rocks lying around;

00:49:17.855 --> 00:49:20.058 align:middle line:84%
they have been called
into the consciousness.

00:49:20.058 --> 00:49:21.292 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: I just love that part of-

00:49:21.292 --> 00:49:23.594 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: On Tuesday, guys
want to go in there and look

00:49:23.594 --> 00:49:27.465 align:middle line:84%
at masculinity, so now that's
a hexagram, solar energy.

00:49:27.465 --> 00:49:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Then different stones
come into positioning,

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.836 align:middle line:84%
and on Saturday we're going to
have another party, want to play

00:49:31.836 --> 00:49:35.440 align:middle line:84%
with sound, toning, and then
the whole site comes together;

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.841 align:middle line:84%
your original site of
Stonehenge [inaudible]

00:49:36.841 --> 00:49:39.544 align:middle line:84%
to a seven point
star, which of course,

00:49:39.544 --> 00:49:43.748 align:middle line:84%
consists of the seven notes of
the pyramid scale, the Do Re Mi;

00:49:43.748 --> 00:49:46.984 align:middle line:84%
that's why we all know the Do
Re Mi, regardless of culture.

00:49:46.984 --> 00:49:48.586 align:middle line:90%
It's high wired.

00:49:48.586 --> 00:49:50.721 align:middle line:84%
So that's when the
whole site comes alive,

00:49:50.721 --> 00:49:53.391 align:middle line:84%
so the site really
comes alive depending

00:49:53.391 --> 00:49:54.759 align:middle line:90%
on what you bring to it.

00:49:54.759 --> 00:49:57.361 align:middle line:84%
It knows that you're there; it'd
read you like a credit card.

00:49:57.361 --> 00:49:58.563 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It does.

00:49:58.563 --> 00:50:00.131 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Gets your PIN and
it goes, we'll let him in.

00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:01.399 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It's so interesting

00:50:01.399 --> 00:50:04.068 align:middle line:84%
because when you're near
Stonehenge, you can just

00:50:04.068 --> 00:50:06.304 align:middle line:84%
as easily not pay attention
to people are you're whistling

00:50:06.304 --> 00:50:07.939 align:middle line:84%
by the freeway to
the supermarket

00:50:07.939 --> 00:50:09.140 align:middle line:90%
and not pay any attention

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.209 align:middle line:84%
to this thing right
off the freeway.

00:50:11.209 --> 00:50:13.978 align:middle line:84%
Well, freeway; I guess you call
it a [inaudible] there, but yes.

00:50:13.978 --> 00:50:17.315 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: It's two lane road, which
means in Britain it's a highway.

00:50:17.315 --> 00:50:19.984 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: A highway, yeah,
and everyone just arguing

00:50:19.984 --> 00:50:23.387 align:middle line:84%
or listening to radio and this
magnificent thing is seating

00:50:23.387 --> 00:50:25.723 align:middle line:84%
right there and most
people don't even stop.

00:50:25.723 --> 00:50:27.191 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Yeah, and again,
it goes back to the people

00:50:27.191 --> 00:50:29.794 align:middle line:84%
who are either alive or
they are the living dead,

00:50:29.794 --> 00:50:32.663 align:middle line:84%
as the ancestors call them, or
the ones who have resurrected.

00:50:32.663 --> 00:50:34.332 align:middle line:84%
And during a date
people would say,

00:50:34.332 --> 00:50:35.500 align:middle line:90%
"Stonehenge looks really dead.

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:36.801 align:middle line:90%
There's no energy."

00:50:36.801 --> 00:50:38.002 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, because
people are walking

00:50:38.002 --> 00:50:39.570 align:middle line:84%
around with their
walkie-talkies talking about.

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:40.805 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, and cell phones.

00:50:40.805 --> 00:50:42.707 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: And this [inaudible]
by people with slaves.

00:50:42.707 --> 00:50:44.041 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right, exactly.

00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:46.811 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: And then in the evening
when everybody disappear,

00:50:46.811 --> 00:50:49.347 align:middle line:84%
you'd go there, you got
special permission to go inside,

00:50:49.347 --> 00:50:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and you can get it, and
you go there quietly,

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:55.386 align:middle line:84%
and the place is totally
different, totally different.

00:50:55.386 --> 00:50:59.824 align:middle line:84%
This organism comes out from a
stumble, and it talks to you.

00:50:59.824 --> 00:51:02.026 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to describe
how it does this.

00:51:02.026 --> 00:51:04.395 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, I'd love to try it;
I've never been there at night.

00:51:04.395 --> 00:51:05.229 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Oh, you have to.

00:51:05.229 --> 00:51:06.664 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: I will; next time I will.

00:51:06.664 --> 00:51:08.266 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's go to Shart [phonetic]

00:51:08.266 --> 00:51:09.934 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Oh, I was just there.

00:51:09.934 --> 00:51:11.135 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And also,

00:51:11.135 --> 00:51:12.937 align:middle line:84%
when you're-while you're
talking-we only have time

00:51:12.937 --> 00:51:16.073 align:middle line:84%
for a couple more, but while
you're talking about it,

00:51:16.073 --> 00:51:20.178 align:middle line:84%
would you help us understand the
notion of the number of layers

00:51:20.178 --> 00:51:23.114 align:middle line:84%
of structures that some of
the-like Eggfoo [phonetic] Some

00:51:23.114 --> 00:51:25.917 align:middle line:84%
of these dwellings we can
see are on-maybe just take

00:51:25.917 --> 00:51:28.753 align:middle line:84%
that for a moment before you
even get to Shart [phonetic]

00:51:28.753 --> 00:51:31.055 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Actually it applies
to a lot of sacred sites.

00:51:31.055 --> 00:51:34.292 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians were very
careful about stipulating

00:51:34.292 --> 00:51:37.995 align:middle line:84%
in their building text that
no place is considered sacred

00:51:37.995 --> 00:51:40.031 align:middle line:84%
unless they're built on
at least twelve layers

00:51:40.031 --> 00:51:43.734 align:middle line:84%
of previous consecrated temples,
correctly consecrated temples.

00:51:43.734 --> 00:51:45.002 align:middle line:90%
I'm not talking about religion;

00:51:45.002 --> 00:51:48.372 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
actual worship, you know;

00:51:48.372 --> 00:51:51.209 align:middle line:84%
the divine in a non physical
non [inaudible] sense.

00:51:51.209 --> 00:51:52.543 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So you think

00:51:52.543 --> 00:51:54.378 align:middle line:84%
about something not maybe
built five thousand years ago

00:51:54.378 --> 00:51:55.813 align:middle line:90%
on top of twelve-

00:51:55.813 --> 00:51:57.181 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Way before that.

00:51:57.181 --> 00:52:00.184 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: On top of twelve more
structure on top of each other.

00:52:00.184 --> 00:52:01.252 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Yeah, we're talking

00:52:01.252 --> 00:52:02.753 align:middle line:84%
about some twelve
thousand continuous use,

00:52:02.753 --> 00:52:06.457 align:middle line:84%
so [inaudible] was built on at
least twelve layers of temple.

00:52:06.457 --> 00:52:07.992 align:middle line:84%
Shart [phonetic]
was built-let's see,

00:52:07.992 --> 00:52:10.595 align:middle line:84%
the present structure
was rebuilt three times.

00:52:10.595 --> 00:52:15.132 align:middle line:84%
The earliest that we can
see at the Westgate was

00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:16.300 align:middle line:90%
by the [inaudible] templar

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.336 align:middle line:84%
who have followed
the ancient recipe.

00:52:18.336 --> 00:52:20.605 align:middle line:84%
That was built on another
cathedral to build on top

00:52:20.605 --> 00:52:23.174 align:middle line:84%
of the Roman temple, which is
built on top of a Roman church,

00:52:23.174 --> 00:52:26.611 align:middle line:84%
which is built on top of a
Roman Catholic [inaudible]

00:52:26.611 --> 00:52:30.047 align:middle line:84%
which is built on top of a
Judaic cave, which is built

00:52:30.047 --> 00:52:31.015 align:middle line:90%
on top of a manhead [phonetic],

00:52:31.015 --> 00:52:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and I keep going
and going and going.

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: I love it.

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:33.584 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:52:33.584 --> 00:52:34.852 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: [inaudible] secret cave,

00:52:34.852 --> 00:52:37.955 align:middle line:84%
where even today you can
drink the water from the well,

00:52:37.955 --> 00:52:40.825 align:middle line:84%
called the Well of the Strong,
which is why people go there,

00:52:40.825 --> 00:52:42.827 align:middle line:84%
to drink the water because
there is something efficacious

00:52:42.827 --> 00:52:44.962 align:middle line:90%
about the water, and [inaudible]

00:52:44.962 --> 00:52:47.498 align:middle line:84%
So layer upon layer upon layer
upon layer, so that builds

00:52:47.498 --> 00:52:48.833 align:middle line:84%
up the sanctity of
sites [inaudible]

00:52:48.833 --> 00:52:51.702 align:middle line:84%
of the people going there
today, regardless of the fact

00:52:51.702 --> 00:52:54.171 align:middle line:84%
that it's not a Catholic site,
but that's beside the point.

00:52:54.171 --> 00:52:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Go there for what it's there,
for what it's actually there,

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.542 align:middle line:84%
and you get a deep
understanding.

00:52:58.542 --> 00:52:59.911 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, I'd
love for you to talk

00:52:59.911 --> 00:53:03.581 align:middle line:84%
about for quite a little bit
long, but we have to move on.

00:53:03.581 --> 00:53:05.483 align:middle line:90%
So, let's talk about-OK,

00:53:05.483 --> 00:53:07.818 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about the
[inaudible] monument.

00:53:07.818 --> 00:53:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: [inaudible] is lovely.

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:12.290 align:middle line:84%
If you don't like heights,
it's going to be a hard one.

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:14.925 align:middle line:84%
You have to descend
this very tall ladder.

00:53:14.925 --> 00:53:16.861 align:middle line:84%
It's not a rackety
ladder; it's a good ladder.

00:53:16.861 --> 00:53:19.297 align:middle line:84%
You get up into this
cliff phase,

00:53:19.297 --> 00:53:20.965 align:middle line:90%
with a beautiful natural cave,

00:53:20.965 --> 00:53:23.701 align:middle line:84%
and you see a beautiful
cave there.

00:53:23.701 --> 00:53:25.169 align:middle line:84%
[inaudible] is aligned
to the Southwest.

00:53:25.169 --> 00:53:27.571 align:middle line:84%
Now, alignment is another
principle of sacred space;

00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:29.373 align:middle line:84%
it's part of that
sacred language.

00:53:29.373 --> 00:53:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Your alignment defines what the
temple does, so if you-the key

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:35.513 align:middle line:84%
that is aligned to the
Southwest, in that position,

00:53:35.513 --> 00:53:38.382 align:middle line:84%
in that part of the world,
aligns with the [inaudible]

00:53:38.382 --> 00:53:41.786 align:middle line:84%
So it's an honoring the spirit
well for the fruits of the labor

00:53:41.786 --> 00:53:44.522 align:middle line:84%
of the land, but also for
the fruits of who you are

00:53:44.522 --> 00:53:46.924 align:middle line:84%
as a person, how well
you've developed the year,

00:53:46.924 --> 00:53:47.958 align:middle line:90%
you give thanks.

00:53:47.958 --> 00:53:50.227 align:middle line:84%
It's their way of
doing thanksgiving.

00:53:50.227 --> 00:53:53.364 align:middle line:84%
It marks the location of two
intersecting female lines

00:53:53.364 --> 00:53:57.435 align:middle line:84%
of energy, the same spot, and
when you go into it, if you can,

00:53:57.435 --> 00:53:59.570 align:middle line:84%
there are two little niches
which one is positioned

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:02.740 align:middle line:84%
to the North, and the North
represents the spirit of Earth,

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:04.041 align:middle line:90%
the [inaudible] of earth.

00:54:04.041 --> 00:54:07.111 align:middle line:84%
So you work with humanity
and the tribe, human beings,

00:54:07.111 --> 00:54:09.613 align:middle line:84%
but there is also a
niche in the Southeast,

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:11.916 align:middle line:84%
which is where the
Winter Solstice comes up

00:54:11.916 --> 00:54:13.951 align:middle line:90%
and that's [inaudible] So that's

00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:16.921 align:middle line:84%
where they would [inaudible]
again, reflect life to the land,

00:54:16.921 --> 00:54:19.790 align:middle line:84%
so that the tribe can go on to
living the rest of the year.

00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:22.193 align:middle line:90%
So it's a small round site.

00:54:22.193 --> 00:54:24.962 align:middle line:84%
Looks quite inconsequential when
you get there, but it was used

00:54:24.962 --> 00:54:26.530 align:middle line:84%
for multiple purposes
during the year,

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:28.366 align:middle line:84%
which of course the
Americans would do

00:54:28.366 --> 00:54:30.835 align:middle line:84%
because their cycle is
dependent on the seasons.

00:54:30.835 --> 00:54:31.902 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Beautiful.

00:54:31.902 --> 00:54:33.003 align:middle line:90%
Now-

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:33.671 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Which should
take you fifteen years

00:54:33.671 --> 00:54:34.238 align:middle line:90%
to understand this.

00:54:34.238 --> 00:54:34.905 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Exactly.

00:54:34.905 --> 00:54:35.940 align:middle line:90%
No, it's all right.

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:37.141 align:middle line:84%
No, you make it very
accessible for us

00:54:37.141 --> 00:54:38.609 align:middle line:90%
in your book, Divine Blueprint.

00:54:38.609 --> 00:54:41.679 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about another
aspect of all of this,

00:54:41.679 --> 00:54:45.182 align:middle line:84%
about the falling away of life,
the falling away of knowledge

00:54:45.182 --> 00:54:47.685 align:middle line:84%
through an era of history
that both you and I have,

00:54:47.685 --> 00:54:51.622 align:middle line:84%
just a strong appreciation
for it, and that's the area

00:54:51.622 --> 00:54:53.858 align:middle line:84%
of [inaudible], his
father, also [inaudible]

00:54:53.858 --> 00:54:56.293 align:middle line:90%
and what happened there.

00:54:56.293 --> 00:54:59.530 align:middle line:84%
What was going on because it
seems to reflect what descended

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:03.300 align:middle line:84%
into Roman Catholicism
and other kind

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.070 align:middle line:84%
of descending traditions
overtime.

00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:08.172 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Yeah, I mean,
the creative gods

00:55:08.172 --> 00:55:10.574 align:middle line:84%
and the building gods that came
off of the mount of the flood,

00:55:10.574 --> 00:55:12.710 align:middle line:84%
they were very [inaudible],
and they were clever;

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:14.311 align:middle line:84%
they understood thatl
of these structures

00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:16.213 align:middle line:84%
and elements were
all temporarily.

00:55:16.213 --> 00:55:19.383 align:middle line:84%
Earth is a place of temporary
places and it depends

00:55:19.383 --> 00:55:22.219 align:middle line:84%
on the will of people and
whoever was in charge;

00:55:22.219 --> 00:55:25.089 align:middle line:84%
so by the time we get
to thirteen hundred B.C,

00:55:25.089 --> 00:55:26.424 align:middle line:90%
[in audible] the third,

00:55:26.424 --> 00:55:29.860 align:middle line:84%
is trying to wrestle the temple
back from the priesthood,

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:32.463 align:middle line:84%
who have now passed out
how it worked, you know.

00:55:32.463 --> 00:55:34.698 align:middle line:84%
If we get control of the
temple, we have control

00:55:34.698 --> 00:55:36.033 align:middle line:90%
of the mind of the people.

00:55:36.033 --> 00:55:37.635 align:middle line:84%
We do not need the pharaoh;
we don't need anybody else.

00:55:37.635 --> 00:55:40.604 align:middle line:84%
We can become the
intermediaries of the people

00:55:40.604 --> 00:55:41.705 align:middle line:90%
between body and soul.

00:55:41.705 --> 00:55:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Was there
political financial element

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:44.542 align:middle line:90%
to that as well?

00:55:44.542 --> 00:55:46.177 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: There is a huge
political thing that goes

00:55:46.177 --> 00:55:49.146 align:middle line:84%
to how priests how they develop
this huge estate as well.

00:55:49.146 --> 00:55:50.414 align:middle line:90%
Sound familiar?

00:55:50.414 --> 00:55:53.017 align:middle line:84%
So he got a little bit
far, according to priests.

00:55:53.017 --> 00:55:57.221 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be out of a job,
so about [inaudible] the third;

00:55:57.221 --> 00:56:00.524 align:middle line:84%
his son comes along, the
wonderful [inaudible]

00:56:00.524 --> 00:56:03.627 align:middle line:84%
and he says, "OK, I'm not
going to sort of push it

00:56:03.627 --> 00:56:04.829 align:middle line:90%
from my way around this.

00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:06.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go straight
to the jugular

00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:10.100 align:middle line:84%
where resting the templar and
the priesthood-just to make sure

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:13.037 align:middle line:84%
that you know, we're moving
the captain thieves [inaudible]

00:56:13.037 --> 00:56:16.907 align:middle line:84%
desert at [inaudible]
brand new place;

00:56:16.907 --> 00:56:19.810 align:middle line:84%
although from my research,
it is clear that it was built

00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:21.745 align:middle line:84%
in the navel of the
earth as well.

00:56:21.745 --> 00:56:23.848 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a master of
this; I won't go into it.

00:56:23.848 --> 00:56:27.084 align:middle line:84%
So, he was trying to, again,
to wrestle that control again,

00:56:27.084 --> 00:56:30.454 align:middle line:84%
and it's quite well defined
by his honoring of his altar,

00:56:30.454 --> 00:56:31.555 align:middle line:90%
the central solar

00:56:31.555 --> 00:56:34.058 align:middle line:84%
that represents the
pure light of the sun.

00:56:34.058 --> 00:56:36.026 align:middle line:84%
He didn't do what all
the other gods did;

00:56:36.026 --> 00:56:39.230 align:middle line:84%
he basically [inaudible] and in
one single entity because it was

00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:41.165 align:middle line:90%
like the things that you can get

00:56:41.165 --> 00:56:43.167 align:middle line:84%
from the church today,
the indulgences.

00:56:43.167 --> 00:56:44.134 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:56:44.134 --> 00:56:45.269 align:middle line:84%
>> FS> If y buy enough
indulgences,

00:56:45.269 --> 00:56:46.837 align:middle line:84%
you lessen the amount
of time in purgatory,

00:56:46.837 --> 00:56:48.739 align:middle line:84%
and that was happening
already back then.

00:56:48.739 --> 00:56:50.107 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's how the
priests made their living.

00:56:50.107 --> 00:56:51.208 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Let's get rid of that.

00:56:51.208 --> 00:56:52.443 align:middle line:90%
Let's just do one entity,

00:56:52.443 --> 00:56:54.478 align:middle line:84%
and then everybody else
basically followed into that

00:56:54.478 --> 00:56:56.046 align:middle line:84%
and as long as you
can focus yourself

00:56:56.046 --> 00:56:58.249 align:middle line:84%
from the central god
head, you can't go wrong.

00:56:58.249 --> 00:57:00.384 align:middle line:84%
The temple goes back
to the people.

00:57:00.384 --> 00:57:01.819 align:middle line:84%
Got lost for about
eighteen years

00:57:01.819 --> 00:57:05.122 align:middle line:84%
until the priest again managed
to wrestle control from him

00:57:05.122 --> 00:57:07.091 align:middle line:90%
and just basically-you know,

00:57:07.091 --> 00:57:09.460 align:middle line:84%
couldn't find an organized
priesthood, and then we went

00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:11.996 align:middle line:84%
from that to the next
thousand years into the a state

00:57:11.996 --> 00:57:14.865 align:middle line:84%
of total war from the Middle
East all the way through Europe,

00:57:14.865 --> 00:57:18.102 align:middle line:84%
and went that with organized
religion; even in spite the fact

00:57:18.102 --> 00:57:20.404 align:middle line:84%
that once in a while, you
have evidence like Jesus,

00:57:20.404 --> 00:57:23.641 align:middle line:84%
popping out of the wood
work, and John the Baptist,

00:57:23.641 --> 00:57:26.176 align:middle line:84%
who was even more
important again how he gets

00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:28.679 align:middle line:84%
in the tension, but
then he tries

00:57:28.679 --> 00:57:31.782 align:middle line:84%
to actually bring the
priesthood out of the temple

00:57:31.782 --> 00:57:32.750 align:middle line:90%
and back to the people.

00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:33.984 align:middle line:90%
We all know what happened there.

00:57:33.984 --> 00:57:35.085 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:57:35.085 --> 00:57:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: And we're still
learning the lesson,

00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:40.524 align:middle line:84%
but I think that as things
go, the swing tends to go

00:57:40.524 --> 00:57:41.859 align:middle line:90%
from one extreme to the other.

00:57:41.859 --> 00:57:45.329 align:middle line:84%
We can see that there is a
little shout of life appearing

00:57:45.329 --> 00:57:47.998 align:middle line:84%
in the horizon where people
begin to pick up the idea

00:57:47.998 --> 00:57:50.501 align:middle line:84%
that these temples were
built for a reason other

00:57:50.501 --> 00:57:53.370 align:middle line:84%
than an organized system that
you have to give your power

00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:57.107 align:middle line:84%
to somebody else because
even Jesus said this.

00:57:57.107 --> 00:57:59.677 align:middle line:84%
You know, the temple of
god is resides within you,

00:57:59.677 --> 00:58:01.845 align:middle line:84%
and the Egyptian said the
same things on their walls.

00:58:01.845 --> 00:58:04.248 align:middle line:84%
Until people recognized
the temple

00:58:04.248 --> 00:58:06.283 align:middle line:90%
and the energy is right here,

00:58:06.283 --> 00:58:07.785 align:middle line:84%
we're going to keep
building temples.

00:58:07.785 --> 00:58:08.852 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like a joke.

00:58:08.852 --> 00:58:10.521 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And now temples
have become-well,

00:58:10.521 --> 00:58:13.257 align:middle line:84%
when Temple Mountain
particularly, I mean,

00:58:13.257 --> 00:58:19.463 align:middle line:84%
on such hollow land, on so
many levels, the profundity

00:58:19.463 --> 00:58:23.801 align:middle line:84%
of what is possible on that
land, to have descended it

00:58:23.801 --> 00:58:26.070 align:middle line:84%
into something nothing
more than political

00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:27.271 align:middle line:90%
and power struggles now.

00:58:27.271 --> 00:58:29.206 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: Yeah, and that
showcases the whole gamma

00:58:29.206 --> 00:58:30.874 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:58:30.874 --> 00:58:33.611 align:middle line:84%
You have the choice between
making it something beautiful

00:58:33.611 --> 00:58:35.713 align:middle line:84%
or something very ugly and
both shades in between,

00:58:35.713 --> 00:58:40.117 align:middle line:84%
but that's the thought of
having free will of earth.

00:58:40.117 --> 00:58:40.884 align:middle line:90%
You get both.

00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:42.019 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: You get both.

00:58:42.019 --> 00:58:43.287 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: The trick is to
understand who you are

00:58:43.287 --> 00:58:45.656 align:middle line:84%
and your place and
your soul purpose

00:58:45.656 --> 00:58:48.092 align:middle line:84%
by attending these
places, and you can do it.

00:58:48.092 --> 00:58:51.061 align:middle line:84%
Once you have that degree of
self awareness and self control,

00:58:51.061 --> 00:58:53.631 align:middle line:84%
now you have-you can
know where you're going;

00:58:53.631 --> 00:58:54.798 align:middle line:90%
no one can tell you what to do.

00:58:54.798 --> 00:58:55.733 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:58:55.733 --> 00:58:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: That's the
best you can do.

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:58.702 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Where are
you headed next?

00:58:58.702 --> 00:59:00.471 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: Oh, I don't know.

00:59:00.471 --> 00:59:02.139 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I mean, you finished
this beautiful thing.

00:59:02.139 --> 00:59:04.875 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to relax for a bit
or are you going to continue?

00:59:04.875 --> 00:59:06.343 align:middle line:84%
>> FS: I was going to
write some fictions,

00:59:06.343 --> 00:59:07.611 align:middle line:90%
some historical fictionist.

00:59:07.611 --> 00:59:08.979 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Would you please?

00:59:08.979 --> 00:59:11.649 align:middle line:84%
There are a few people-there
are a few people I know-I mean,

00:59:11.649 --> 00:59:14.084 align:middle line:84%
Glen [inaudible] of course,
has-I interviewed him recently,

00:59:14.084 --> 00:59:17.821 align:middle line:84%
but other people as well who are
also bordering into the world

00:59:17.821 --> 00:59:20.791 align:middle line:84%
of science and as a terror
scientist who has decided

00:59:20.791 --> 00:59:23.293 align:middle line:84%
to take that track just
to get away from that flag

00:59:23.293 --> 00:59:28.065 align:middle line:84%
from academia and be able to,
with passion, express a story.

00:59:28.065 --> 00:59:29.199 align:middle line:90%
I love this idea.

00:59:29.199 --> 00:59:31.101 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking for a
new kind of book

00:59:31.101 --> 00:59:33.270 align:middle line:90%
to read myself [inaudible] time.

00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:34.238 align:middle line:90%
Would you please?

00:59:34.238 --> 00:59:35.439 align:middle line:90%
Come up with something good.

00:59:35.439 --> 00:59:38.475 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can put
[inaudible] in it.

00:59:38.475 --> 00:59:39.309 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: OK.

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:40.277 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Alright, there you go.

00:59:40.277 --> 00:59:41.045 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:59:41.045 --> 00:59:42.479 align:middle line:90%
>> FS: My pleasure.

00:59:42.479 --> 00:59:44.648 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Again, the book is
titled Divine Blueprint

00:59:44.648 --> 00:59:46.950 align:middle line:84%
and it's a must read for
anyone wanting to connect

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:48.485 align:middle line:84%
with the sacredness of
this earth and themselves.

00:59:48.485 --> 00:59:50.487 align:middle line:84%
You can find it at his
website, invisibletemples.com.

00:59:50.487 --> 00:59:51.955 align:middle line:84%
And if you enjoy this episode,
I suggest you check out two

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:53.090 align:middle line:84%

interviews with Freddy.

Freddy Silva on Crops
Circles and Mystery

00:59:54.258 --> 00:59:55.192 align:middle line:84%

Freddy Silva.

00:59:55.192 --> 00:59:56.293 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:59:56.293 --> 00:59:57.327 align:middle line:84%
