00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSEPH SELBIE:
We are continuously

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.300 align:middle line:84%
creating maintaining and
sustaining the physical body.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.140 align:middle line:84%
If we did not have
an energy body,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.300 align:middle line:84%
the physical body
would cease to exist.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Puff of atoms and
it would be gone.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.303 align:middle line:84%
We exist in two
different realms.

00:00:24.303 --> 00:00:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: At least.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: At least.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.000 align:middle line:84%
All of us have been
on a long journey.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.290 align:middle line:90%
We've been everything.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And in that process, we've come
to how we perceive ourselves.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something
that will endure forever.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.050 align:middle line:90%
We can, in fact, change it.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.248 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: From what you can
tell, what is happening?

00:00:41.248 --> 00:00:43.415 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Well, I've been
curious about that myself.

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:47.203 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.203 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you look
at the actual material

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.840 align:middle line:84%
makeup of a human being,
the atoms that make us us

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.970 align:middle line:90%
fit on the head of a pin.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.610 align:middle line:84%
What then is this body
and all that we see?

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.800 align:middle line:84%
If we're nothing but
space, what keeps us

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:84%
from passing through
one another and dropping

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.565 align:middle line:90%
through the Earth beneath us?

00:01:03.565 --> 00:01:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Selbie and
I will be talking

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.140 align:middle line:84%
about what makes up our
3D perceived reality

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and why mind, i.e.
consciousness, matters.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in a sense,
it's all that matters.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.913 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Welcome, Joseph.

00:01:15.913 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Thank
you for having me.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's
good to have you here.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.810 align:middle line:90%
I loved your book.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And Sandie Sedgbeer, a
colleague of mine in England--

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.230 align:middle line:84%
we were interviewed
for OMTimes and talked

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.750 align:middle line:84%
about what we think are
the most essential books.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And yours was on
both of our lists.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.510 align:middle line:90%
I have to tell you that.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Wow.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "The Physics of God."

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: I'm honored.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's really important.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.580 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to dive right in.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.220 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
quantum physics

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and reality and consciousness,
which a lot of people

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.960 align:middle line:90%
glaze over and think, aha.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.360 align:middle line:84%
But this is going to
be fun because we're

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.970 align:middle line:84%
going to do it via story
and some examples that

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:84%
are so stunning, we can't ignore
the fact that we actually do

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:90%
create our own reality, right?

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yeah.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.490 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.073 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
start-- we're going

00:01:58.073 --> 00:01:59.480 align:middle line:90%
to start right in on this one.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So you say that we-- this--
we are a local manifestation

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:90%
of a nonlocal phenomena.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's just start there
in regular human terms.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.620 align:middle line:10%
>>SELBIE: So
nonlocality is a term

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.630 align:middle line:10%
that gets kind of
bandied about in a lot

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:24.550 align:middle line:10%
of scientific discussions and
in spiritual teachings combined,

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.600 align:middle line:10%
because nonlocality
is essentially

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.980 align:middle line:10%
another realm, a deeper
realm, a more subtle realm

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.040 align:middle line:10%
than the three-dimensional
physical realm

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.060 align:middle line:10%
that we perceive
through our senses.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that
it exists is one

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.810 align:middle line:84%
of the most significant
supports for the idea

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.990 align:middle line:84%
that there's more to us
than a physical body.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: If there's an
entirely more subtle realm,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.290 align:middle line:84%
vast subtle realm that
exists nonlocally,

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:84%
whereas the
three-dimensional is local,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:84%
it suggests that we exist
in two different realms--

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At least.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: --at least.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And that should be very
exciting for everybody,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:84%
because as everybody
fears and hangs

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.500 align:middle line:84%
on to this physical
manifestation, if we all

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.880 align:middle line:84%
truly understood that we are
a multidimensional being that

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.120 align:middle line:84%
exists far beyond whatever
happens to this Earth suit,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.713 align:middle line:84%
it would change, I
think, the way we live.

00:03:27.713 --> 00:03:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: And it does.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Those who have near-death
experiences, almost

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:84%
universally say that the one
most significant realization

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.340 align:middle line:84%
they have after they
return is that they

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.510 align:middle line:90%
have no fear of death.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And that it puts
in a completely different

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.540 align:middle line:84%
perspective to work on why
they are doing what they're

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:84%
doing when they're alive, which
is mainly learning to love,

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.190 align:middle line:84%
give, and care for others,
and that that's the number one

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:90%
reason that we're all here.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's the same thing.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.785 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter who the person
is and what their history was,

00:04:02.785 --> 00:04:04.610 align:middle line:84%
same thing comes
up over and over.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So if this is just all of this
is a field of possibility, then

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.200 align:middle line:84%
what determines you
versus me and this table

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.485 align:middle line:90%
versus the floor?

00:04:15.485 --> 00:04:16.285 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Nothing.

00:04:16.285 --> 00:04:18.459 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.820 align:middle line:84%
It's all been manifested
through a mechanism that

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.050 align:middle line:84%
begins in nonlocality and
expresses itself in locality,

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:84%
in this three-dimensional
material world.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.860 align:middle line:84%
But our physical
bodies are just as

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.820 align:middle line:84%
real and unreal as
this table or the world

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.760 align:middle line:84%
that we perceive around
us because they're all,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.520 align:middle line:84%
as you said at the beginning,
mostly empty space.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.630 align:middle line:84%
The atoms that surround
us and make us up

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.433 align:middle line:90%
are 99.999% empty space.

00:04:57.433 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean to
give a visual on it,

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:84%
if you looked at our solar
system and the planets

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.310 align:middle line:84%
in the solar system, that's kind
of what most atoms look like,

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yeah.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's it.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And look how far
apart these things are

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and how much space
there is in between.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Every atom in our body,
essentially, is like that.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
hardest part for people

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.090 align:middle line:90%
to get their minds around.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:26.970 align:middle line:84%
How come physical five-sensory
reality feels so real?

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:90%
What is it in our being?

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And this comes down to
collective perceptions,

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and beliefs, and realms, and
creation, and creative minds,

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.050 align:middle line:84%
and programming, but it's
all essentially programming.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a program.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: It's an expression--

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A created expression--

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: --of our mind--

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: --that gives
us the form that we have.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And when we change our
conviction about what we

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:84%
look like or our
state of health or any

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.550 align:middle line:84%
of the physical
attributes of ourselves,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.120 align:middle line:84%
they will actually
change immediately.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to talk
about that in a stunning story

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.420 align:middle line:90%
in a moment.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But this is interesting because
people feel it's down to fate.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.510 align:middle line:84%
If you're born with a
disability or if someone's

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:23.090 align:middle line:84%
born with very irregular
features and this is something

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.820 align:middle line:84%
they feel self-conscious with
and go through life with,

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.920 align:middle line:90%
it seems very unfair.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.460 align:middle line:84%
At face value, looking
at life on this planet,

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.960 align:middle line:84%
socioeconomically
and physically,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.670 align:middle line:90%
it can seem very unfair.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But what you just
said is really key.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Well, all of us
have been on a long journey

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.515 align:middle line:90%
beyond just one lifetime.

00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.055 align:middle line:90%
We've been everything.

00:06:48.055 --> 00:06:48.310 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: We've been everything.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And in that process,
we've come to, today,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.880 align:middle line:90%
how we perceive ourselves.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something
that will endure forever,

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and that we can,
in fact, change it.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
to make it sound

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:84%
like it would be easy to
change it because convictions--

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.630 align:middle line:84%
there's the old
saying about, well,

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:16.120 align:middle line:84%
if it's just in your mind,
then it must be easy to change.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:22.160 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, the fact that it is
in your mind is the hard part--

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is--

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: --not the easy part.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
not the easy part.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.260 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Because here we're laden
with all of the subconscious

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.720 align:middle line:84%
programming from our
past, everything that's

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.270 align:middle line:84%
ever been resides
in the subconscious

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and is carried forward from
incarnation to incarnation

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:84%
to inform us, to essentially
keep us out of danger

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.400 align:middle line:90%
and alive.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, red alert,
red alert, it's

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.858 align:middle line:84%
all over in the subconscious,
everything that's

00:07:45.858 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:90%
ever happened that's harmed us.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And also, everything that's
happened that's made us laugh

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.490 align:middle line:90%
and given us joy.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.170 align:middle line:84%
But it's constantly talking
to us without our knowledge.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's reinforcing patterns
and beliefs of lifetime

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.220 align:middle line:90%
after lifetime.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.930 align:middle line:84%
That's why when you say the
mind is that's the hard part.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle line:90%
That is the hard part.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Yeah, the mind
is like the sum total

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.900 align:middle line:90%
of all of our experiences.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the ones in
this life are dominating,

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
but we have millions,
billions of other impressions,

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.400 align:middle line:84%
other convictions that
are supporting everything

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:84%
that we believe
and understand now.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.310 align:middle line:90%
And constitute what our mind is.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.910 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to this one
case in your book that

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.419 align:middle line:90%
is just so stunning.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:36.380 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- I've shared it
with other people, too--

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.289 align:middle line:90%
stop thinking about.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's the woman with the
multiple personality disorder.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So set it up first
about this woman,

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:84%
who she was, how she became
analyzed, why they began

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.170 align:middle line:90%
studying her to begin with.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go into
some of the manifestations.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Well, a common
thing about people

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:84%
suffering from multiple
personality disorder--

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.910 align:middle line:90%
and I do mean suffering from.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.930 align:middle line:84%
It's not an enviable
condition to be in.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.690 align:middle line:84%
But a common way in
which they're discovered

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:09.740 align:middle line:84%
is that they go to a
doctor or a psychologist

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:14.060 align:middle line:84%
because they believe
that they're amnesiacs,

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:84%
that they can't remember
whole chunks of their lives.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.565 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And then it
eventually comes out

00:09:20.565 --> 00:09:22.190 align:middle line:84%
that the reason why
they can't remember

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:26.060 align:middle line:84%
is that they're only
one player of many

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.680 align:middle line:90%
who are playing out that life.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And so once
they get diagnosed

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.190 align:middle line:84%
with this multiple
personality disorder,

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:38.990 align:middle line:84%
they discover the amazing
differences in personality

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.770 align:middle line:84%
types that are expressed through
these multiple personalities.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Some can speak foreign
languages that others can't.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Some can play instruments
that others can't.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's really quite varied.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.120 align:middle line:84%
But what's lesser
known is that each one

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:84%
of those multiple
personalities also

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.280 align:middle line:90%
have physiological differences.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, this
is the shocking part,

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.800 align:middle line:84%
because this is where mind
and consciousness comes back

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.600 align:middle line:90%
into play.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Exactly.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:11.130 align:middle line:84%
So you might have one
personality that has a mole--

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.805 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: --and another
that doesn't have it.

00:10:13.805 --> 00:10:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
has been validated.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yes.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.490 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:17.448 align:middle line:90%
Been measured by many--

00:10:17.448 --> 00:10:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This woman has been
measured and it'll disappear

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:90%
or reappear--

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.982 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Right.

00:10:21.982 --> 00:10:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --with the
personality that comes in,

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle line:90%
which sounds impossible.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yeah.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And some of it runs
very deep, rather than

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.660 align:middle line:90%
superficial skin conditions.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.320 align:middle line:90%
One woman had 10 personalities.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And she was measured
by an optician

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.080 align:middle line:84%
as each of 10 personalities
rolled through within an hour.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And the makeup of the eye-- the
measurable makeup of the eye

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.410 align:middle line:84%
was different in every one
of those 10 personalities,

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:58.460 align:middle line:84%
including, in one case,
the color of the iris

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.300 align:middle line:90%
was different.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.350 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And you
have voices change.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.950 align:middle line:90%
Scars come and go--

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yeah.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --from people.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:10.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And one of the more
amazing ones that I actually

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.190 align:middle line:84%
ran into more
recently that isn't

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.650 align:middle line:84%
in my book, "The
Physics of God,"

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:21.080 align:middle line:84%
is about a woman who has 9
out of 10 of her personalities

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:27.710 align:middle line:84%
can see, to varying degrees
of quality, but one of them

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:29.373 align:middle line:90%
is completely blind.

00:11:29.373 --> 00:11:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hmm.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And when they
measure her blind personality,

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:39.990 align:middle line:84%
they do so by flashing a really
bright light right in her eyes.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:41.840 align:middle line:90%
You can't fake that.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And you
can't fake that.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:43.385 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: There's no--

00:11:43.385 --> 00:11:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No response.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: No response
in the brain--

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.143 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: --to this.

00:11:47.143 --> 00:11:50.930 align:middle line:84%
But yet, with the other
nine, there is a response.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, this opens
up many cans of worms

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.540 align:middle line:84%
but also some really
fascinating possibilities

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.090 align:middle line:90%
that I'm curious about.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.940 align:middle line:84%
In one sense, I look
at it and think,

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:07.120 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that, for
reasons I don't comprehend,

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.350 align:middle line:84%
a soul may have many different
expressions that are choosing

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.240 align:middle line:90%
to express in this timeline?

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Is it that other beings
are coming with their DNA

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.640 align:middle line:84%
from other dimensions
and surfing

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.480 align:middle line:84%
into this person, their
field, and changing them

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.120 align:middle line:90%
on a genetic level?

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.880 align:middle line:84%
From what you can tell,
what is happening?

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.035 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Well, I've been
curious about that myself

00:12:34.035 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And I've had conversations
with psychics

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:44.900 align:middle line:84%
who say that it's 10
different beings or however

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:50.390 align:middle line:84%
many personalities a
particular sufferer has.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:53.403 align:middle line:84%
They're all different beings
coming in at different times.

00:12:53.403 --> 00:12:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Surfing off
of this individual

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.080 align:middle line:84%
to have an expression
in the physical world.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yeah.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.670 align:middle line:84%
But I also think that
it's not necessary

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.583 align:middle line:90%
that it be different people.

00:13:03.583 --> 00:13:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm
wondering that, too.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Because I
think that the key is

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:84%
the absolute conviction in
the mind of each personality.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.690 align:middle line:84%
So each personality
when they come in,

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.220 align:middle line:84%
they bring different
convictions.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:84%
The convictions they
bring are from--

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:24.830 align:middle line:84%
I have a mole on my right wrist,
that I need to wear glasses--

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:30.020 align:middle line:84%
all of those things, they
come in 100% convinced

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.220 align:middle line:90%
because they have no--

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
their experience.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:90%
That's hard fact.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: That's
hard fact for them.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And they
have no perspective

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.970 align:middle line:84%
that there are
other personalities

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.070 align:middle line:84%
within that same
sufferer who differ.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:45.050 align:middle line:84%
So for them, of course, they
have a mole on their wrist.

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:46.520 align:middle line:90%
And they do.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that just
shows us how quickly

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:84%
the physiological
aspect of ourselves

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:84%
can be changed with an imprint
from a being or a soul.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And I've also wondered
if it might not

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.870 align:middle line:84%
be expressions of us even
coming through from other times.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:07.100 align:middle line:84%
If they say time is basically
an infinity loop, instead

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:84%
of linear, then
could it possibly

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:13.400 align:middle line:84%
be some of our old personalities
coming back and trying

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.550 align:middle line:84%
to experience or rectify
something in this time,

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and we carry those
traits we had then?

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Yeah, I think
all of those are possible.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't necessarily
have to be one or the other.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it doesn't
because each one brought with it

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:32.780 align:middle line:84%
its own genetic blueprint
for their life in that time.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And each being, if
it's different beings,

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.770 align:middle line:84%
is bringing through its
own genetic blueprint.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Right.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's actually
affecting a person on a DNA

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.597 align:middle line:90%
level, but at warp speed.

00:14:44.597 --> 00:14:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Instantaneously.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Instantaneously.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.040 align:middle line:84%
A scar comes and
then just disappears.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.610 align:middle line:90%
It's like what you see in films.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:51.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yeah.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.640 align:middle line:90%
Or the eye color changes.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or the
eye color changes.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.420 align:middle line:90%
To me, this is phenomenal.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And the story of these
multiple personalities

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.170 align:middle line:84%
that have been witnessed
and measured, to me

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.980 align:middle line:84%
is phenomenal in
that it illustrates

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:11.600 align:middle line:84%
how quickly our reality
can change, like you say,

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.760 align:middle line:84%
when there is this conviction
that creates an imprint.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And I think
that in each one of us,

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.500 align:middle line:84%
in more practical
terms, since most of us

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.470 align:middle line:84%
are not multiple
personality sufferers,

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:29.220 align:middle line:84%
but we change
instantly all the time.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:84%
So when you're moving from one
emotional level to another,

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.030 align:middle line:90%
it changes your entire body.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:84%
If a conviction is newly
awakened or reawakened

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.590 align:middle line:84%
in your mind, it
changes your entire body

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:middle line:90%
and it does so instantaneously.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And in a given day,
they say that our genes

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:84%
can be upregulated
or deregulated

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:04.360 align:middle line:84%
in the thousands of
changes in one day,

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.530 align:middle line:84%
in one person just going
about an ordinary life.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.540 align:middle line:90%
We're not fixed.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.230 align:middle line:90%
We are anything but fixed.

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It sounds like the way
in which we appear to be fixed

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.990 align:middle line:84%
is that generally
we'll tend to go

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:25.930 align:middle line:84%
to some kind of dominant stable
system of belief or function,

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:26.770 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to fix
us so that you still

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:84%
look like you or I
still look like me

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and have a relatively
stable level of health.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.240 align:middle line:84%
But this can change
very rapidly as well.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, it changes
with each emotion.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.730 align:middle line:84%
If the system becomes
overwhelmed and acidic,

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:46.750 align:middle line:84%
we start going into a
different kind of decline,

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.835 align:middle line:84%
almost like a rapid
kind of deterioration

00:16:48.835 --> 00:16:50.002 align:middle line:90%
in the immune system.

00:16:50.002 --> 00:16:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Yeah, and you can
see it in people's faces.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: You can
see their face fall.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.550 align:middle line:84%
You can have this experience of
thinking someone has just aged.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: But at the same
time, you have the opposite--

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Opposite, yeah.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: --where they
seem more youthful.

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.790 align:middle line:84%
The smiles come, the energy
comes through their eyes,

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.079 align:middle line:90%
and they are more youthful.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:11.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's not subjective.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.849 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:16.329 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yeah,
so, I mean, this

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:19.599 align:middle line:84%
is something for each one
of us to play with, I think,

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:84%
when everyone's
done watching this,

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:26.230 align:middle line:84%
to think about that, because
the quality of our feelings--

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.960 align:middle line:84%
not just our thoughts, but
the quality of our feelings

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.305 align:middle line:84%
is going to dictate the harmony
within our physical being.

00:17:32.305 --> 00:17:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yeah.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.430 align:middle line:84%
A powerful part of
our health is emotion.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Those two--
emotion and conviction--

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:48.670 align:middle line:84%
are probably 75%-85% of
our whole health picture,

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:53.500 align:middle line:84%
where diet, exercise, all the
things that people are mostly

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.590 align:middle line:90%
preoccupied with, are far less.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So that gets me to-- well, I
have a lot of questions here,

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.850 align:middle line:84%
but we'll get into the building
blocks of reality in a bit,

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.440 align:middle line:90%
get back to the quantum world.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.640 align:middle line:84%
But something that
is intriguing is

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.730 align:middle line:84%
because humanity has
this kind of empathy

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:84%
and we have these kinds of
commitments to each other,

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:19.360 align:middle line:84%
how often people bring
themselves down emotionally

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and suffer in
relationship to someone

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.990 align:middle line:90%
they love who's suffering.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:25.600 align:middle line:90%
So it's not even ours.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:84%
We're taking on another
person's suffering

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and basically bringing
our entire system down

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:32.950 align:middle line:90%
in the process.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost as though
we feel disloyal or callous

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:84%
if we don't acknowledge someone
else's suffering by suffering.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're a
lifelong meditator.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And you have followed Yogananda
and Yogananda's practices

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.430 align:middle line:90%
for most of your life.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.498 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:18:50.498 --> 00:18:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of the
suffering people are saying,

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:84%
yeah, but my husband's doing
so poorly or my mother's dying,

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and by association
we're dying, too.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Well, a good
friend once used the analogy

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:13.920 align:middle line:84%
that if someone is
drowning and you

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.930 align:middle line:84%
can't swim, jumping in to
save them is not a good idea.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Give them some kind
of life ring or something

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.930 align:middle line:84%
that will actually allow them
to get out of their suffering.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So our suffering, our
emotional depression

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:35.890 align:middle line:84%
does nothing for
the other person.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:38.130 align:middle line:84%
It does just the opposite
for the other person.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:38.253 align:middle line:90%
It reinforces it.

00:19:38.253 --> 00:19:39.711 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
we are entangled.

00:19:39.711 --> 00:19:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: We're entangled.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And as we started off, talking
about nonlocality, most of what

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.030 align:middle line:90%
we experience--

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:55.730 align:middle line:84%
our emotions, our convictions,
our thoughts, our memories,

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.000 align:middle line:90%
our life force--

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.640 align:middle line:90%
they're all nonlocal.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And because they're nonlocal,
and particularly this

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.550 align:middle line:84%
is significant with
emotion, because there's

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:84%
no distance between
us, you're experiencing

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:84%
my emotion as strongly as
I'm experiencing it myself

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:90%
and vice versa.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And that it's entangled,
yes, but it's also

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.630 align:middle line:90%
immediate and real.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And then once you connect,
you stay connected.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:35.052 align:middle line:84%
And you can be a
carrier of depression.

00:20:35.052 --> 00:20:36.260 align:middle line:90%
You can just bring it along--

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: --from
person to person.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Or you can be a
carrier of joy and positivity

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.220 align:middle line:90%
and happiness.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think our highest
service to each other

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:56.610 align:middle line:84%
is to genuinely stay in an
elevated state of consciousness

00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:01.872 align:middle line:84%
and in harmonious,
loving emotions.

00:21:01.872 --> 00:21:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the best
we can do for the person we

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:90%
love who's suffering.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard because we have
all this beaten into us--

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.800 align:middle line:90%
guilt, being of service--

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.380 align:middle line:84%
that life has
beaten into people.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.400 align:middle line:90%
You owe it to them.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they did so much
for me growing up.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.880 align:middle line:90%
I must suffer on their behalf.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:90%
This is all backward.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yes.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.900 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have
to be Pollyannaish--

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: --and go and beam at
this person who's depressed,

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:84%
because you'll probably
just annoy them--

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Make them more depressed.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: --or whatever
reaction they will have.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:39.250 align:middle line:84%
So you have to just be genuinely
centered in your own harmony

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and respond to them
meaningfully rather

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:48.080 align:middle line:84%
than from any sense of what you
should or shouldn't be doing.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Anything obligatory.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yeah.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Really come
from your knowingness.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yeah.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because so
much of the suffering

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:59.210 align:middle line:84%
is happening in relationship
and in entanglement with others.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And so, interestingly,
the Nobel Prize in physics

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:08.920 align:middle line:84%
was finally awarded to a team
of three scientists in October

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:14.240 align:middle line:84%
of 2022 for proving that
entanglement exists, right?

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Right.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: American,
Austrian, and French.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
interesting and I thought,

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.780 align:middle line:90%
finally, it's about time.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.350 align:middle line:84%
We have to start honoring the
spooky action at a distance

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.590 align:middle line:84%
factor in science and
giving it legitimacy.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:32.440 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing
was the American scientist

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.010 align:middle line:84%
commented afterwards-- he
said, we have proven it.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:39.020 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea how it works.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's because,
yet, with all of this,

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.460 align:middle line:84%
they seem not to
be able to embrace

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:90%
the notion of consciousness.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:52.470 align:middle line:10%
>>SELBIE: Well, I think
they would embrace it.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.680 align:middle line:10%
I think many of them
embrace it personally,

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.630 align:middle line:10%
but they don't
bring it into what

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:10%
they think of as their
professionalism as a scientist.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:06.980 align:middle line:84%
But there isn't
any specific proof

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.940 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness
exists outside of us,

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.810 align:middle line:84%
outside the body, beyond
the physical realm.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And yet, everything
points to it.

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: But until
there is that proof,

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:22.700 align:middle line:84%
then scientists, like
the three you mentioned,

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:28.710 align:middle line:84%
are professionally bound to be
skeptical or say, I don't know.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.730 align:middle line:90%
But I think the tide is turning.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:35.360 align:middle line:84%
I think more and more
scientists, more and more

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:42.530 align:middle line:84%
people are embracing the reality
of consciousness being not born

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:43.910 align:middle line:90%
of the brain but a preexisting--

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Something
we're bathed in.

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.443 align:middle line:84%
It's something the
entire universe exists.

00:23:47.443 --> 00:23:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And it's
the foundation.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the foundation
of everything in all dimensions,

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:52.860 align:middle line:90%
in all universes.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yes.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It
precedes everything.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And so because this spills over
into spirituality and religion,

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.170 align:middle line:84%
it seems like that's
the difficulty.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:06.260 align:middle line:84%
It's still the difficulty
in the world of science.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And I think in
fairness, for a lot of people,

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.460 align:middle line:90%
what we think of as--

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.700 align:middle line:84%
what you and I probably
think of as spirituality

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.270 align:middle line:90%
isn't that familiar to them.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:18.000 align:middle line:84%
They're thinking
in religious terms.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.092 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: They're thinking of--

00:24:20.092 --> 00:24:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Biblical terms.

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: --a belief system,
where experiential spirituality

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:31.620 align:middle line:84%
is where consciousness
really becomes real.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And you
experience it directly.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:37.380 align:middle line:84%
You feel it beyond
the physical body.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you feel yourself
to be so much more

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:44.370 align:middle line:84%
than just the physical body
that your convictions change.

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And once
your convictions

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:47.390 align:middle line:90%
change, it's obvious.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:50.450 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It's obvious
that everything

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.420 align:middle line:84%
is born of consciousness,
and that you

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.550 align:middle line:84%
are an expression of
that consciousness,

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.130 align:middle line:84%
and that it's loving and
that it's intelligent.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And that really s
the God that I talk

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.210 align:middle line:90%
about in "The Physics of God."

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Is that infinite
intelligent, loving

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.060 align:middle line:84%
consciousness of which
I and everyone else

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.440 align:middle line:90%
is an integral part.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which has
unfathomable creative potential.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.800 align:middle line:90%
And that extends to us as well.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.910 align:middle line:84%
So another book that is
one of these essentials

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.450 align:middle line:84%
that everyone must read
is actually "Autobiography

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:26.800 align:middle line:90%
of a Yogi," right?

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.550 align:middle line:90%
And so I loved all--

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.680 align:middle line:90%
it's just such a readable book.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's a fun journey
to go along on his ride

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:39.100 align:middle line:84%
when he was a young man
and seeking one thing.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
he had a strong will.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.030 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
he and the others

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.250 align:middle line:90%
in India at the time--

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:52.930 align:middle line:84%
well, and still to this day,
who are seeking this oneness

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:57.310 align:middle line:84%
with the divine, have to let
go of a certain personal notion

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:59.200 align:middle line:84%
of who they are, a
certain identity.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And for him and the others,
it was very interesting

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:05.320 align:middle line:84%
because, along the way, they
watched the most amazing things

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.040 align:middle line:84%
along the line of this
multiple personality disorder.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some
of the different kinds

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:16.630 align:middle line:84%
of saints and phenomena
that Yogananda experienced

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:18.430 align:middle line:84%
as he was going through
his young journey

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:20.320 align:middle line:84%
to teach him reality
is not what we

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.960 align:middle line:84%
think it is, because
it's very fun, really.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.635 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: He loved
to visit saints.

00:26:24.635 --> 00:26:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there
were a lot of them.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And there
were a lot of them.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:28.525 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were
all over in Kolkata.

00:26:28.525 --> 00:26:29.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Yeah,
it makes one long

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.890 align:middle line:90%
to go back to that kind of time.

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: But one that comes
to mind is this perfume saint.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: So he went
to visit this saint.

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And what he would do is he
could give any flower any scent.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you wanted to
have a flower that

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.120 align:middle line:84%
was ordinarily scentless have
lavender, or lilac, or rose,

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.410 align:middle line:90%
he could do it.

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't just subjective,
because you could then

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:08.440 align:middle line:84%
take that flower and offer it to
someone who wasn't even there,

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and they would smell
that fragrance that

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:12.620 align:middle line:90%
didn't belong to that flower.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And there was
the levitating saint

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:20.200 align:middle line:84%
who could do a breathing
exercise to such

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.990 align:middle line:84%
a powerful degree that he
would rise from the floor

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:27.148 align:middle line:84%
and he could stay floating for
indefinite periods of time.

00:27:27.148 --> 00:27:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember
him also talking

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:31.990 align:middle line:84%
about one who really couldn't
control it all that well.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:33.430 align:middle line:90%
They just kind of float up.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:35.500 align:middle line:90%
And this one was--

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.050 align:middle line:84%
this one he was writing
about was actually

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.340 align:middle line:90%
I believe a Catholic.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Saint
Joseph of Cupertino.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Saint
Joseph of Cupertino

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:47.420 align:middle line:84%
where he would just float up and
he couldn't keep himself down.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Share a little bit about that.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.230 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't read about him before.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Yeah, he became
so inspired so easily.

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:58.450 align:middle line:84%
All he had to do
was see a crucifix,

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:04.060 align:middle line:84%
or hear a sacred song, or
anything could set him off,

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and he would literally
just begin to rise.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, he did this in the
court of the Pope at the time.

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And he did it so
often that his brother

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.310 align:middle line:84%
monks, they were just so used
to it, they would grab him.

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:21.910 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Try to
bring him back down.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: So that
he didn't get--

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:24.680 align:middle line:90%
so he didn't get out of reach.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I love that.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: So that they
could keep him tethered.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he had saints
that were walking through walls.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.720 align:middle line:84%
There was another
one of the yogis

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:41.260 align:middle line:84%
who fought tigers, wild Bengali
tigers with his bare hands,

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.168 align:middle line:90%
until his ego got out of check.

00:28:43.168 --> 00:28:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And that was interesting,
the lessons that were taught.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.500 align:middle line:90%
What happens when ego comes in?

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Well, he
was fighting tigers

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.260 align:middle line:84%
against the advice
of someone who

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:58.910 align:middle line:84%
he knew later was his
spiritual teacher and also

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:01.230 align:middle line:84%
against the advice
of his father.

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:03.930 align:middle line:84%
But he was a powerful
man to begin with.

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And so he got caught
up in the power.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, he was
doing shows all over.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.028 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: He was doing shows.

00:29:10.028 --> 00:29:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And he had his final
comeuppance, his final lesson

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:24.500 align:middle line:84%
when a maharaja challenged him
to fight his tiger that was

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.480 align:middle line:90%
quite large, quite powerful.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They got a
big wild Bengali tiger.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yeah.

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They captured one.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And then
they didn't feed it.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.580 align:middle line:84%
It was horrifying
reading about it.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:35.690 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: But he was
grievously wounded

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.660 align:middle line:84%
in the fight with the
tiger, but he won.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And then
he almost died

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:47.640 align:middle line:90%
from the wounds of the tiger.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.023 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And it was then that
his spiritual teacher came back

00:29:51.023 --> 00:29:53.550 align:middle line:90%
to him and said, are you done?

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Are you done--

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With your performances
and your egoic tricks.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.898 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: If you're
done with this,

00:29:58.898 --> 00:30:01.760 align:middle line:84%
then let's move on to fighting
the real battles, which

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:08.530 align:middle line:84%
are the inner battles of wrongly
understanding who we are.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Getting
beyond the notion

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:12.970 align:middle line:90%
that we are this physical body.

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny because Yogananda
felt that a lot of this

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:19.290 align:middle line:90%
was almost--

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:22.950 align:middle line:84%
it was fun, but he felt it
was almost like parlor tricks.

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't really
what he was looking for.

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.480 align:middle line:84%
He was looking for
something more essential.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yes,

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's the thing
that his teachings pass on,

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:35.070 align:middle line:84%
and that you are looking
for, and millions of people

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.030 align:middle line:84%
are looking for this
essential thing.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.450 align:middle line:84%
So I want to take that
part of the conversation

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:45.210 align:middle line:84%
into the notion that there is
this perfected template, almost

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:52.080 align:middle line:84%
like the Elysian Fields that
the Greeks and Roman heroes were

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.600 align:middle line:84%
given access to, told
they would have access

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:59.410 align:middle line:84%
to upon their deaths, which is
many people have glimpsed this,

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:02.070 align:middle line:84%
which is simply a perfected
version of what we're

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.350 align:middle line:90%
seeing right now here on Earth.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
it in hermetic terms,

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.910 align:middle line:84%
they call it the fourth
realm or the realm

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:10.890 align:middle line:90%
of the children of the sun.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about the
perfected template, ego,

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and how we start living in
alignment with our very truest,

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:25.320 align:middle line:84%
highest manifestation
here without getting

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.650 align:middle line:84%
all caught up in the ego,
in our sense of self.

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yeah.

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:38.400 align:middle line:84%
I think people, certainly
decades ago, became overly

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.620 align:middle line:84%
obsessed with ego
and the thought

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:43.170 align:middle line:84%
that they had to break
the boundaries of ego

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:49.180 align:middle line:84%
or they had to suppress the
ego in order to be spiritual.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think it just took on
a dimension of concern that

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:54.090 align:middle line:90%
was unnecessary.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
you can't ever get rid--

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:57.840 align:middle line:84%
ego is the accumulation
of what you are.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yeah.

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And a good friend
once said that there

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:04.770 align:middle line:84%
are two ways to see
what is happening

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:06.370 align:middle line:90%
in the spiritual life.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:11.460 align:middle line:84%
One is that you can think of it
that your ego is reducing down

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:16.600 align:middle line:84%
to nothing, which is
kind of the Buddhist

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:21.730 align:middle line:84%
approach and other paths as
well, that they gradually

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.400 align:middle line:84%
disassociate with
anything that's egoic.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And in the process, they
re-associate with everything

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:29.200 align:middle line:90%
that is infinite.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.640 align:middle line:84%
But you can also think of
it as your ego expanding

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.680 align:middle line:90%
until it reaches infinity.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And both of those points
of view are equally valid.

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: So on
the path I'm on--

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Yogananda's path-- he
basically encourages

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:57.850 align:middle line:84%
people to be creative and
to take the ego into higher

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.520 align:middle line:84%
and higher octaves
of manifestation

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:06.750 align:middle line:84%
rather than being overly
concerned with what I'm feeling

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:12.390 align:middle line:84%
today and what I'm experiencing
today and reacting positively

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:16.680 align:middle line:84%
or negatively to that, which
is a manifestation of ego.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Instead, to take it
up a level or two

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:25.260 align:middle line:84%
and express who you are at
higher and higher levels

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.230 align:middle line:90%
of awareness and consciousness.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:32.672 align:middle line:84%
And I think for Westerners
that's very attractive.

00:33:32.672 --> 00:33:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think so,
too, because if you

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.600 align:middle line:84%
look at it in the purest
sense, if the ego is

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.990 align:middle line:84%
just a collective of everything
we are up to this point

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.280 align:middle line:90%
in time, that's us.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.130 align:middle line:90%
It is our individuated self.

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:45.810 align:middle line:84%
But it sounds like
what you're saying,

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and Yogananda was
saying, but don't use it

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:49.980 align:middle line:84%
in a self-conscious way
where you're constantly

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.530 align:middle line:84%
self-evaluating and
self-flagellating.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, beyond that, the
thing I'm referring to more

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:58.350 align:middle line:84%
is almost kind of
an over-identity

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:00.540 align:middle line:84%
with I am the CEO
of this corporation.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.280 align:middle line:84%
When I lose my business card, I
lose my identity and I'm dead.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Right.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm talking
about that kind of very

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.530 align:middle line:84%
stark and severe
over-identification

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:13.020 align:middle line:84%
with a particular role,
for example, which actually

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.630 align:middle line:84%
kind of blocks you
from the beauty of what

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:16.770 align:middle line:90%
you're trying to become.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yes.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.150 align:middle line:90%
I agree completely.

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
key, which I always

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.780 align:middle line:84%
come back to in every
conversation I have

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.250 align:middle line:90%
with anyone, is meditation.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: That the CEO who's
over-identifying and therefore

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.719 align:middle line:84%
is up or down, according
to whether the company is

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:84%
up or down, is always going to
be that way unless and until he

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:48.050 align:middle line:84%
or she can feel and
experience directly

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:51.800 align:middle line:84%
that there is a deeper reality
of which they are a part.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And otherwise
it's all ideas.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:01.220 align:middle line:90%
And it has no reality.

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:04.650 align:middle line:84%
That CEO may say, oh, yeah,
I understand all that.

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:08.810 align:middle line:84%
But then their company takes
a big dip and so do they.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:14.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's not enough to
say that is a truth.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:18.170 align:middle line:84%
You have to experience
it and feel it directly.

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And then when the company dips
and you don't dip with it,

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.810 align:middle line:84%
then you have a real
powerful change in your life.

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about the template.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have
some time left here

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.220 align:middle line:84%
to get into some of
the mechanics of it.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Starting 1D, 2D, 3D, because
it's a little different way

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:39.470 align:middle line:84%
to look at it than
a lot of people do.

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:42.260 align:middle line:84%
We think of the lower
dimensions as, ooh, icky,

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.240 align:middle line:84%
has to be terrible
down there, you know.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:48.590 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So let's talk about
the original point-- the 1D, 2D,

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:49.610 align:middle line:90%
up to 3D--

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:52.190 align:middle line:84%
and the perfected
template and what it

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:57.340 align:middle line:84%
takes for us to live
into and be that.

00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Well, I think that
the basic metaphysical structure

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:05.230 align:middle line:84%
that you're speaking of is
that our physical bodies are

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:09.690 align:middle line:84%
three-dimensional, our subtle
nonlocal bodies that I talked

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:11.850 align:middle line:84%
about, that are
composed of ideas,

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:16.840 align:middle line:84%
and memories, and life
force, are two-dimensional.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And then there's an
ideational body, if you will,

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:26.570 align:middle line:84%
that isn't even in form,
that is one-dimensional.

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that just
a field of potential?

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Well, according to
Yogananda, it is all potential,

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:36.680 align:middle line:84%
but that there is yet
another realm beyond it

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:40.130 align:middle line:84%
that has zero
dimensions, which is just

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:43.400 align:middle line:90%
pure being, pure consciousness.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And that it's from
that pure consciousness

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and the infinite
intelligence that

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:54.320 align:middle line:84%
is that pure consciousness,
that the first dimension is

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.000 align:middle line:90%
created, the ideational level.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the second
level that is energetic.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the third
level, which is physical.

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is one
metaphysical description.

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if you
want to say it this way,

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:17.540 align:middle line:84%
the most perfect template
begins with the one-dimensional

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.160 align:middle line:90%
thought forms.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the second dimension

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:28.440 align:middle line:84%
of two dimensions of energy,
that is an expression of that.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And then finally, you
have the physical dimension,

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.070 align:middle line:84%
which is an expression
of the two dimensional.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:39.080 align:middle line:84%
So the key for us, I
think to understand,

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:43.820 align:middle line:84%
is that we are mostly
zero dimensions.

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.710 align:middle line:90%
We are spirit.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Even though we don't have an
awareness of it every day,

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:53.850 align:middle line:84%
day in and day out, it is still
fundamentally of who we are.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
our ideation, which

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.880 align:middle line:84%
is where our deep
convictions come from of who

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.450 align:middle line:90%
and what we are.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we have this
two-dimensional body,

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:09.350 align:middle line:84%
which is a exact
counterpart or a--

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Almost like
an empiric double.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: --perfect counterpart
of the physical body.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we change
anything in the energy body,

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.053 align:middle line:84%
it immediately changes
in the physical body.

00:38:23.053 --> 00:38:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of
things come to mind.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.720 align:middle line:84%
I was taught this one particular
very rapid healing technique,

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.380 align:middle line:84%
but really all it entails
is collapsing the moment

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:36.150 align:middle line:84%
into that perfected
template you're

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:39.550 align:middle line:84%
talking about with
consciousness and letting it go

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:40.840 align:middle line:90%
and letting it do its thing.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I hadn't really
looked at it that way

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:44.910 align:middle line:90%
until you're bringing this up.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I'm
flashing back to

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:50.940 align:middle line:84%
is one time I was contemplating
the nature of all of this.

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was the same, but I was
seeing it as the 10th, ninth,

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:58.080 align:middle line:90%
and eighth chakras.

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And here he's saying it
goes from zero, one, two,

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:02.820 align:middle line:90%
up to three.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.550 align:middle line:84%
So either way you look at it,
it was the exact same principles

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.770 align:middle line:90%
of first there's the thought--

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:08.880 align:middle line:90%
the thought form.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I was seeing
in that next dimension

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:18.870 align:middle line:84%
a movement, geometry, color,
light, sound, and everything

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:22.110 align:middle line:84%
that started
constructing into what

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:24.870 align:middle line:84%
looks like a physical
reality and etheric form.

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, boom, it would drop in
to physicality, physical form.

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:31.690 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like it's the exact
same thing, just in reverse.

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yeah.

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of looking at
top down, instead of bottom up.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:38.380 align:middle line:84%
But bottom up actually makes
more sense on a creative level.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.610 align:middle line:90%
But it's the same thing.

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And I can see it so
clearly that whatever

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.480 align:middle line:84%
the quality of that
thought is, immediately

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.960 align:middle line:84%
all these constituent building
blocks, mathematics, all of it,

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.320 align:middle line:84%
rush in and start
creating what's going

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.010 align:middle line:90%
to become a physical reality.

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yeah.

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:56.910 align:middle line:84%
I think what you
experienced was what

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:58.930 align:middle line:84%
I think of as the
mechanism of creation.

00:39:58.930 --> 00:39:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.590 align:middle line:90%
It was the mechanics of it.

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: And that's both
beyond us and within us,

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:11.160 align:middle line:84%
that we are guiding that
mechanism of creation

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.700 align:middle line:90%
each and every one of us.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening
subconsciously.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.773 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's happening
without our awareness

00:40:16.773 --> 00:40:18.060 align:middle line:90%
with every single thought.

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yes.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:22.950 align:middle line:84%
We are continuously
creating, maintaining,

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:29.050 align:middle line:84%
and sustaining the physical
body from the energy body.

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And that if we did not
have an energy body,

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.350 align:middle line:84%
the physical body
would cease to exist.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Like a
puff of atoms and it

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:46.560 align:middle line:84%
would be gone, because it is the
holographic part of the system.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:53.550 align:middle line:84%
So the energy body is the
hologram of film, if you will.

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And the energy in that realm
works through that hologram

00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:02.100 align:middle line:84%
to project the holographic
projection that

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:03.790 align:middle line:90%
is our physical body.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:08.305 align:middle line:84%
And so that mechanism is
something that's continuous.

00:41:08.305 --> 00:41:09.105 align:middle line:90%
It's constant.

00:41:09.105 --> 00:41:11.140 align:middle line:90%
It never goes away.

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then, as I
said in the open of this,

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:16.050 align:middle line:84%
in our last few minutes,
what is it that keeps us

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:18.540 align:middle line:84%
from walking through each
other, bumping into things,

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:22.290 align:middle line:84%
falling down through the Earth
itself, which also isn't solid?

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Well, a
lot of teachings

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:28.260 align:middle line:84%
say that this world is an
illusion, and that I think

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:31.440 align:middle line:84%
tends to make people think
that there's nothing there.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: There's
something there.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.350 align:middle line:90%
It's just not what it seems.

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: So like a magician
doing a show in Las Vegas,

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.560 align:middle line:90%
that illusion is real stuff.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:48.490 align:middle line:84%
It just doesn't appear to
be what it actually is.

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:54.510 align:middle line:84%
So our physical reality
is real, but it's

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:59.850 align:middle line:84%
not the hard, physical matter
that we tend to think it is.

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:03.660 align:middle line:84%
It's these empty
spheres of atoms.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:06.210 align:middle line:84%
But the reason why those
empty spheres of atoms

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:09.482 align:middle line:84%
don't just collapse one into the
other is the electron clouds--

00:42:09.482 --> 00:42:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I wanted to get to.

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: --around them.

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Huge
forcefield around these.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:15.068 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: It creates a
little forcefield that's

00:42:15.068 --> 00:42:17.910 align:middle line:84%
very hard to collapse
unless you're at CERN,

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:20.110 align:middle line:90%
or some other collider.

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Normally,
they are very strongly

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:27.240 align:middle line:84%
fixed in their reality,
and they're just

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:30.180 align:middle line:84%
bumping up to each
other and they can't

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:33.220 align:middle line:90%
pass each other's forcefield.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so as a
little bit of matter

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:38.760 align:middle line:84%
that's in this atomic
structure, the forcefield

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.800 align:middle line:84%
itself keeps everything in
its own identity, so to speak.

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Right.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:43.725 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In its own space.

00:42:43.725 --> 00:42:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: Yeah, so all the
empty atom space in this hand

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:52.050 align:middle line:84%
is being repelled from this
hand by the empty matter

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:54.060 align:middle line:90%
forcefields in the other hand.

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.060 align:middle line:84%
When I was reading that
that made sense to me.

00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:58.440 align:middle line:90%
I thought, yeah, that makes--

00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.530 align:middle line:90%
I can feel that.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So before we sign
off here, in the end,

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:06.570 align:middle line:84%
when you were talking about that
first breath of an incarnation

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and the last breath
of an incarnation,

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:15.950 align:middle line:84%
just explain to us how you
see it in your understanding.

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SELBIE: We get drawn back
to this level of reality,

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:26.670 align:middle line:84%
this physical world, because
we're not done with it.

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:29.910 align:middle line:90%
So we've died many, many times.

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And after each one of
those, we have a team--

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:38.730 align:middle line:84%
we have our astral
team of guides

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:42.510 align:middle line:84%
who say we're going to send
you in to a new incarnation.

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:44.160 align:middle line:90%
In we come.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And then genetics and
all the biosciences

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:53.760 align:middle line:84%
start to build a
new body for us.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:57.650 align:middle line:84%
But they do so from
the template that

00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:00.530 align:middle line:84%
exists in the astral
level or the energy

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:02.870 align:middle line:90%
level, the nonlocal level.

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And then we have another
whole movie-like experience

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.730 align:middle line:84%
of another life where we
have lots of adventures,

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:14.000 align:middle line:84%
we have our ups, we have
our downs, all of which

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.930 align:middle line:84%
is an opportunity for
us to learn until we age

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:19.550 align:middle line:90%
and we pass away.

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:24.980 align:middle line:84%
But that whole experience
has a reality to it.

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:29.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to make it
sound like this is nothing,

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:30.630 align:middle line:90%
this three-dimensional reality.

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, no, how we respond
to the moments of our lives

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.050 align:middle line:90%
is everything.

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SELBIE: Yes.

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's, I think, a matter
of sorting out for ourselves

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:43.020 align:middle line:84%
the best responses,
the highest responses.

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:50.460 align:middle line:10%
And to flex our muscles of
higher being so that we become

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.610 align:middle line:10%
more creative, we
become more loving,

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:56.220 align:middle line:10%
we become more intelligent.

00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:04.770 align:middle line:84%
That that's our job is to grow
in those divine gifts that

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:08.358 align:middle line:84%
are the essential
part of who we are.

00:45:08.358 --> 00:45:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, on
that, I'm not even

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.233 align:middle line:90%
going to ask for final thoughts.

00:45:11.233 --> 00:45:12.750 align:middle line:90%
That was a perfect finish.

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:14.190 align:middle line:90%
