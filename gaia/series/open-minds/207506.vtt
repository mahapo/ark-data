We are in a time of
becoming an initiate

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.770 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to go the
way of indoctrination.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.300 align:middle line:90%
This is the menticide.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And the indoctrination is
not usually of your making.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.610 align:middle line:90%

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Essentially, telling
you what you believe to be true

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.660 align:middle line:84%
isn't and their
reality is the truth.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle line:90%
This is an epidemic right now.

coming from outside ourselves.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Internally, we're
never confused.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.770 align:middle line:90%
We know.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.680 align:middle line:84%
When we are being
in our power, we're

actually helping our
beloved goddess Mother Earth

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.240 align:middle line:84%
because our beloved Earth has
the ability to compost it.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.490 align:middle line:84%

need the emotional sensitivity

Tiffany Barsotti is
here with us today

and doubt are allowing

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:84%
the world and its people to be
propagandized and controlled.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.220 align:middle line:84%
We're also going to talk about
how we can transform this.

>>BARSOTTI: Thank you.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's always
so fun to look at you.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.422 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Oh, the same.

00:01:38.422 --> 00:01:40.590 align:middle line:84%
I have the same
equal view of beauty.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So this is-- wow, OK.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.670 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's talk
about the notion of a word

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.180 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people
haven't heard,

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.470 align:middle line:84%
which is menticide which
is a fabulous word.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.950 align:middle line:84%
When I was reading this, I
thought, boy, does that--

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.830 align:middle line:84%
does that explain the
times because people aren't

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.490 align:middle line:90%
thinking clearly anymore.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.870 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, tell
us what menticide is.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So I wish I could
take ownership of that word.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.870 align:middle line:10%
It's not something that I
coined, but it came from--

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:10%
it's a Dutch psychiatrist
whose name is Joost, J-O-O-S-T,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.630 align:middle line:10%
Meerloo.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:23.340 align:middle line:10%
And he-- M-E-E-R-L-O-O. He
was studying brainwashing,

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:10%
and in the times of--

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.710 align:middle line:10%
this time when television was
first coming out and seeing

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.670 align:middle line:10%
habits of people and what was
going on with people's minds,

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:10%
he started-- he coined
this phrase of menticide,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.950 align:middle line:10%
that he sees where the
technology could be

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.860 align:middle line:10%
used against us in the future.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's also how a
person can gain control

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.340 align:middle line:84%
over another person
and in the-- and that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.870 align:middle line:84%
comes up in the
form of gaslighting

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.940 align:middle line:90%
as you were just saying.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And narcissists have a-- and
psychopaths and sociopaths have

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.328 align:middle line:84%
a real handle on that
as a habit and anyway,

00:03:00.328 --> 00:03:01.620 align:middle line:90%
I know we'll get further into--

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.453 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we will
get further into it.

00:03:03.453 --> 00:03:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And as we said in
the very beginning,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.240 align:middle line:90%
this is not just personal.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:90%
This is collective.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.540 align:middle line:84%
We're being gaslit
by institutions.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.950 align:middle line:84%
We're being gaslit on a very
important topic of our times

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.920 align:middle line:84%
We are being gaslit by
politicians all the time.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:84%
They take something and
literally reframe it

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.260 align:middle line:90%
in the opposite direction.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And it is one of those
where you just-- it's

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.230 align:middle line:84%
hard not to become angry
and insulted at it.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
But before we go there, let's
go to Carl Jung because I

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.440 align:middle line:90%
took this out off of you, OK?

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:84%
It says, this is
something he said

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and this really is what
we're going to get down to.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
"Until you make the
unconscious conscious,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.545 align:middle line:84%
it will direct our lives
and you will call it fate."

00:03:44.545 --> 00:03:45.345 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:45.345 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes, yes.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to make a little
distinction here, a clearer

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.950 align:middle line:84%
distinction because I think that
we can get a little confused

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.160 align:middle line:84%
about what is fate and what is
destiny because you could say,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.150 align:middle line:84%
we're fated to be
in these times.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So to tease that
out a little bit,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.190 align:middle line:84%
and I'm influenced by
Michael Meade's work

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.090 align:middle line:84%
in this area, is fate is the
family that we're born into.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.600 align:middle line:84%
The people that we end up
traversing our lives with.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Destiny is how it is that
we move along the choices

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.279 align:middle line:84%
that we make, whether or
not we're creating karma

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.839 align:middle line:90%
with those people.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:84%
How engaged are we in
a healthy way and that

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.810 align:middle line:90%
creates our destiny.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and that's a good
differentiation between the two

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.305 align:middle line:90%
and thank you for sharing that.

00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:35.700 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's start getting
into some of what's happening

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle line:84%
and some of what
we're being challenged

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:90%
with because there's so much.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:84%
One of them is our right to say
yes or no, our right to say no.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Our personal sovereignty.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're seeing this all over
the world right now in regards

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:84%
to the virus that's been
around for a year or two.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, draconian practices
are setting in,

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.240 align:middle line:84%
certain governments are saying,
you-- we are mandating this,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:84%
you shall do this or you shall
lose your employment and such.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.350 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.600 align:middle line:84%
No one saw it going--
well, very few people

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.097 align:middle line:90%
saw it going this far.

00:05:08.097 --> 00:05:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what happens when you're

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.940 align:middle line:84%
propagandized into fear, and
then you're told you do this

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:90%
or else.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah,
this is the menticide.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.570 align:middle line:84%
This is where you must
comply, and otherwise you're

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:84%
going to lose whatever you have
deemed as your way of having

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.010 align:middle line:90%
comfort in the world.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And I do want to say and
actually give voice to,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.050 align:middle line:84%
we're all probably about to
be even more uncomfortable

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.483 align:middle line:90%
for a little while here.

00:05:35.483 --> 00:05:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain
what you mean by that.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: So this is--

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.070 align:middle line:84%
what's actually being
called right now

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.450 align:middle line:90%
The Great Resignation.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.710 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of people.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was calling it
The Great Revelation but now

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.370 align:middle line:90%
resignation.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: [LAUGHS]

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yikes.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah, because--

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about that.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.385 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: --people
are quitting their jobs.

00:05:51.385 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:84%
They are-- they're
deciding, no, I

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.850 align:middle line:84%
don't want to succumb my choices
to what the mainframe is.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.140 align:middle line:90%
I want to unplug.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.540 align:middle line:84%
I want to do the things
that are more true to self.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Even some people may not even
know what that true to self

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.820 align:middle line:90%
move is yet.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.860 align:middle line:90%
But they are wanting--

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:84%
they're resigning
out of the fact

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.390 align:middle line:84%
that they're choosing
their own lives.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is amazing.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.423 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
across the board.

00:06:19.423 --> 00:06:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And these are usually jobs
that people aren't particularly

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.130 align:middle line:90%
happy with to begin with.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:90%
It's just to make a buck.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.160 align:middle line:84%
They're underpaid
for their efforts.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, they have a whole
other life agenda paralleling

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.078 align:middle line:84%
it, where someone
wants to be a writer,

00:06:32.078 --> 00:06:33.870 align:middle line:84%
and they're spending
their daytime writing,

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.340 align:middle line:90%
waiting on tables at night.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's been
interesting because there

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:84%
was subsidy for this,
in the United States

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:84%
for sure, but in other
countries as well.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.610 align:middle line:90%
And now the subsidy ends.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.575 align:middle line:90%
Now, what happens?

00:06:45.575 --> 00:06:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Well, this is
what I mean about getting

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.050 align:middle line:90%
very uncomfortable, right?

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- to me, I see
this as an initiation.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.850 align:middle line:84%
We are in a time of
becoming an initiate

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.070 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to go the
way of indoctrination.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:04.537 align:middle line:84%
And the indoctrination is
not usually of your making.

00:07:04.537 --> 00:07:06.030 align:middle line:90%
So it's a choice.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.840 align:middle line:84%
We're in this choice
factor, and this

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.640 align:middle line:84%
becomes a real opportunity for
us to get into our creativity.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.560 align:middle line:84%
What's the thing that
you always wanted to do

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:90%
that you haven't done yet?

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.432 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is like
the perfect time to do it.

00:07:19.432 --> 00:07:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Everything else is
coming unglued so

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.430 align:middle line:90%
do what you want to do.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.230 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.813 align:middle line:84%
There's never been
a more perfect time

00:07:24.813 --> 00:07:27.230 align:middle line:84%
to be yourself and
follow your passion.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.030 align:middle line:90%
You're so right.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.935 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And
believe yourself.

00:07:29.935 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Just start believing
yourself because the antidote

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:84%
to menticide is
believing in yourself.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.030 align:middle line:84%
But when we have all this
confusion about what's true,

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.330 align:middle line:84%
what's not true,
science says this,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.730 align:middle line:84%
science says that,
people who I've

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:90%
trusted, people who I've known.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.600 align:middle line:84%
All of these sort
of things are--

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.990 align:middle line:84%
they're here for us to start
questioning because we have

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.760 align:middle line:90%
lost that ability to question.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.680 align:middle line:84%
That actually begins
with the church.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Don't question
your spiritual nature.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Don't question--

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't question the
official narrative, ever.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.375 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Same thing.

00:08:01.375 --> 00:08:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you mentioned
the word confusion and that's

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.930 align:middle line:90%
a really big part of it.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.240 align:middle line:84%
You say that when
we're confused,

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.790 align:middle line:84%
it almost puts us in a
trance-like state, right?

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's a freezing
pattern of some kind that

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.010 align:middle line:90%
goes on there.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to talk
about confusion for a bit

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:21.190 align:middle line:84%
because I'm noticing so many
people-- just exasperated,

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.820 align:middle line:84%
intelligent bright people,
saying I just have no idea what

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.650 align:middle line:90%
to believe anymore.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:27.700 align:middle line:90%
Lost their bearings.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.517 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yep.

00:08:28.517 --> 00:08:31.480 align:middle line:84%
So confusion literally,
from looking at it

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.390 align:middle line:84%
from a brain analysis,
it's like a state of shock.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.360 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever been in
an accident of any type,

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a car accident
or a horse-riding accident

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.270 align:middle line:84%
or any-- skiing
accident, whatever,

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.510 align:middle line:90%
your body is in a type of shock.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And everything
around you becomes

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.110 align:middle line:84%
how the basis of
reality then starts

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.200 align:middle line:84%
to operate because you've
lost your own center.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.890 align:middle line:84%
So in that, literally, it's like
you put your car in neutral,

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.550 align:middle line:90%
your brain is in neutral.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.710 align:middle line:84%
You're not thinking
for yourself anymore.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So evidence of this
is when a person says,

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't know a lot, and
when they say, I don't know,

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.210 align:middle line:84%
that is a sign that
there's confusion.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, the interesting thing
is that confusion is always

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.220 align:middle line:90%
coming from outside ourselves.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.880 align:middle line:90%
It's never an internal.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Internally, we're
never confused.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.820 align:middle line:84%
We know but we have to get
back to that knowing, right?

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:25.810 align:middle line:90%
The gnosis piece.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gnosis.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:26.785 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:09:26.785 --> 00:09:27.585 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:09:27.585 --> 00:09:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And there is a difference
between karnal knowledge

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.890 align:middle line:84%
with a K and gnosis
with a G, that we

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:34.720 align:middle line:90%
can have our inner knowing.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's the real
opportunity here

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.840 align:middle line:84%
is to come back into
that center of who

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:90%
are we, what am I here to do.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Get back into soul's purpose.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And people have been
overriding that for a long time

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.950 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.313 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I was listening to--

00:09:51.313 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:84%
oh, I think it was one
of "The New York Times"

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.780 align:middle line:84%
podcasts, "The Daily," and
they were talking about--

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.240 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of it, I don't--

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really in alignment with
some of it, some of it I am,

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.620 align:middle line:90%
depending on the reporter.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.710 align:middle line:90%
But this had to do with--

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:10.840 align:middle line:84%
had to do with how we started
disconnecting from, you might

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.270 align:middle line:84%
say, collectively agreed
upon belief systems,

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.570 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
beginning with 9/11, where

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:21.540 align:middle line:84%
what happens when you're not
told the truth about something.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a free-for-all
to try to fill

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.960 align:middle line:90%
in the gaps and the pieces.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what happens
when these larger stories are

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.110 align:middle line:90%
not based on truth.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Our body and our heart
and soul knows we're--

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.120 align:middle line:84%
something's wrong, but we
don't know where to go with it.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So either we buy into
the official narrative

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.817 align:middle line:90%
or we go wherever we want.

00:10:41.817 --> 00:10:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
this whole phenomena.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: A few
really important topics

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.460 align:middle line:84%
on that, it's such
an important piece

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.120 align:middle line:84%
because it helps keep the
menticide actually going.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a term in NLP
called open loops.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's where you leave in
the middle of a conversation,

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.890 align:middle line:90%
you don't finish the thought.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:04.880 align:middle line:84%
So the brain goes, OK,
registered that, that's open.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And then, you can get it filled
in with a missing piece that

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.810 align:middle line:84%
might come from
either someplace else,

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.810 align:middle line:84%
but what it does is it leaves
a little bit of an opening

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:18.950 align:middle line:84%
for an opportunity for
somebody else's idea

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.340 align:middle line:84%
to come in there
because you're hanging,

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.040 align:middle line:84%
you're waiting until
that gets filled in.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:30.980 align:middle line:84%
The other side of
that piece with--

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.520 align:middle line:84%
neurolinguistic programming
is what NLP stands for,

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and used correctly, it can
be quite a healing tool,

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.250 align:middle line:84%
but used incorrectly,
it's a game--

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.670 align:middle line:84%
it's a play-- it's part of
the playbook of the menticide.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.430 align:middle line:84%
So the thing that's really
interesting about how

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:middle line:84%
we can use brain programming is
you can tell somebody something

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.910 align:middle line:90%
three times.

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.490 align:middle line:84%
By the time they've
heard it a fourth time,

00:11:55.490 --> 00:12:00.280 align:middle line:84%
it's a truth even though
it's not the truth.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is true.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.490 align:middle line:84%
This happened when
there were surveys

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:08.030 align:middle line:84%
done on what had happened during
the early years of the Iraq

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.830 align:middle line:90%
War.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.982 align:middle line:90%
And I've forgotten who ran it.

00:12:10.982 --> 00:12:12.940 align:middle line:84%
This is quite a long time
ago, I read about it,

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.280 align:middle line:90%
where people were--

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.380 align:middle line:84%
at one time, when
they learned there

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.600 align:middle line:84%
were no weapons of
mass destruction,

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.340 align:middle line:90%
that was a lie, right?

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And people-- ratings for
the president at the time

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.110 align:middle line:84%
started dropping and
people understood that.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.660 align:middle line:84%
They went back a
couple of years later,

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.210 align:middle line:90%
that had completely reversed.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Were there weapons
of mass destruction?

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:36.550 align:middle line:84%
These samplees, these
people, who were polled,

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:90%
believed it again.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.550 align:middle line:84%
It was as though whatever
had intervened for a moment,

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.970 align:middle line:84%
by way of logic, was
gone back to this program

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:47.650 align:middle line:90%
narrative in their mind.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: That's case in
point of both the open loop

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.390 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that you're
going to come back and say

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.345 align:middle line:84%
something a third and a
fourth and a fifth time.

00:12:55.345 --> 00:12:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And then you're just
going to adopt it.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.620 align:middle line:84%
The discernment is
the answer here.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Coming back into
believing ourselves.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we're all being sold.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:07.362 align:middle line:84%
If we could just understand
that we are in a playbook.

00:13:07.362 --> 00:13:08.162 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And well, who are you
going to be in that play?

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.923 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to choose your
sovereign nature or are you

00:13:14.923 --> 00:13:16.840 align:middle line:84%
going to choose the
indoctrination of somebody

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.960 align:middle line:90%
else's beliefs?

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.250 align:middle line:84%
That's the real test, to see a
test of the initiate right now.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:25.050 align:middle line:84%
We can walk through--
we can fall in the hole

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.280 align:middle line:90%
or we can go through the portal.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
notion of regaining

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.430 align:middle line:84%
this sovereignty
and this discernment

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:37.080 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes pits you against
the outside world, right?

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Because your family is all
watching the same television

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.800 align:middle line:90%
station.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.600 align:middle line:84%
They're all buying
the same story.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
unplug now for a moment,

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
think, wait a minute,

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:90%
that does not feel right to me.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to be
willing to take whatever

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.640 align:middle line:84%
steps necessary, whether
it's a conversation,

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.680 align:middle line:84%
whether you keep it
to yourself, but it

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.660 align:middle line:84%
creates separate--
we're already in a state

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.450 align:middle line:84%
of great separation--
creates even more separation

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.640 align:middle line:84%
when you start taking
back your own mind.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.185 align:middle line:84%
And sovereignty, again, for a
lot of people, very difficult

00:14:06.185 --> 00:14:07.560 align:middle line:84%
because that means
you might have

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.810 align:middle line:90%
to even break from the tribe.

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:13.205 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Well, I've had that
happen in my personal life.

00:14:13.205 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share
something with you.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:84%
I haven't actually
spoken of this at all,

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:22.110 align:middle line:84%
but in the early times
of when COVID was--

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.605 align:middle line:84%
all this, the SARS-CoV-2
was coming out,

00:14:25.605 --> 00:14:28.963 align:middle line:84%
and Paul, my husband,
who's a scientist, we're

00:14:28.963 --> 00:14:30.630 align:middle line:84%
looking at this going,
wow, OK, is there

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.250 align:middle line:90%
really something to fear here?

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.680 align:middle line:84%
At first, we were reacting
like there really was.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.955 align:middle line:84%
And then, not to
say that there--

00:14:37.955 --> 00:14:40.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to discount
anybody who's gotten sick,

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.680 align:middle line:90%
that's not the point.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But when I took this
into my own asking,

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.550 align:middle line:84%
like let me just sit
quiet here for a moment

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:51.900 align:middle line:84%
and ask what is really
going on, the words I heard

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.132 align:middle line:90%
were Ponzi scheme.

00:14:55.132 --> 00:14:57.240 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, huh?

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And this was like the
couple-- first couple of weeks

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:00.900 align:middle line:90%
into the whole thing.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't make
any sense to me.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] Oh, yes.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.590 align:middle line:84%
I know because you're
quite intuitive

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.238 align:middle line:90%
and you do get these messages.

00:15:09.238 --> 00:15:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: And there's--

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I got one right
when the first couple of cases

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.395 align:middle line:84%
came out too, so
continue on with what

00:15:14.395 --> 00:15:16.770 align:middle line:84%
you're saying because it's
right in alignment with yours.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Oh, interesting.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.755 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I did get
COVID, by the way, it's real.

00:15:19.755 --> 00:15:21.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a nasty little
spike protein

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:90%
that shouldn't be there.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:23.940 align:middle line:84%
It shouldn't be in our body,
shouldn't be in vaccines,

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:24.660 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't be there.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Right.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it's there.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: But it's there.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
there, so go ahead.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Well, it's
just living through--

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.900 align:middle line:84%
once you discern for yourself
what you think the truth is you

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.842 align:middle line:90%
can't go back.

00:15:36.842 --> 00:15:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you do, you're
lying on yourself.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.185 align:middle line:90%
And it's not a good place.

00:15:41.185 --> 00:15:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Self-deception
is not a good place.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.143 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: It's not a
good place to operate from.

00:15:45.143 --> 00:15:47.905 align:middle line:84%
So just-- let's
just not do that.

00:15:47.905 --> 00:15:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And also, to understand that
now we have to navigate really--

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use the word in an
affectionate way that is still

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.390 align:middle line:84%
coming from loving kindness
because other people, who

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.650 align:middle line:84%
are not necessarily
seeing it that way

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and are operating out of a
fear, they still need grace.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:11.017 align:middle line:84%
They need a loving kindness
because they're not seeing it.

00:16:11.017 --> 00:16:12.600 align:middle line:90%
So I have a--

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:84%
the saying is that the
most flexible person

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.240 align:middle line:84%
is the most responsible because
you have the flexibility

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.000 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see what the heck
is going on and read the tea

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:25.800 align:middle line:90%
leaves.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And then be able to
modulate and adjust

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:34.170 align:middle line:84%
and know who you can
say what to and so, yes.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:38.990 align:middle line:84%
But I have been
discredited and removed

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.178 align:middle line:84%
from many people's
tribe, if you will.

00:16:42.178 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And I have two.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.600 align:middle line:90%
I've lost friends over this.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
the way people's minds

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.420 align:middle line:90%
went, no, we had 9/11.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:84%
We've had many different
discombobulating

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.590 align:middle line:90%
events over the last 20 years.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:57.800 align:middle line:84%
But I'd say,
certainly, the virus

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.530 align:middle line:84%
is the most
discombobulating because it

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:05.630 align:middle line:84%
was the largest, if you want to
look at it as a top-down thing,

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.250 align:middle line:90%
perhaps agenda, right?

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.260 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot to gain.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot to gain for
certain people in this story

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.560 align:middle line:90%
and in the drugs, et cetera.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.859 align:middle line:84%
So the amount of
manipulation that

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:84%
had to happen to get a
planet to fall into lockstep

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.200 align:middle line:84%
is almost-- it's
more mind-boggling

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.060 align:middle line:84%
than anything I
certainly have witnessed

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:29.030 align:middle line:84%
in my lifetime or any of us
have probably in many lifetimes.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:33.305 align:middle line:90%
So now, we're at the feet of it.

00:17:33.305 --> 00:17:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Well, we're at
the precipice of change,

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.600 align:middle line:90%
and we can either--

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.250 align:middle line:84%
it's all about our
choice, and this

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.400 align:middle line:84%
has to do with our
sovereignty, right?

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.770 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have choice,
then what do we have?

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's really
come up to question.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It really has.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.070 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when you
have a job that you love,

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.710 align:middle line:84%
you're a professor at a
university, and they tell you--

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and you feel, no, it's not
right for me personally.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to have a
vaccination, for example.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And you're forced to
or you lose your job.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're getting
down to crunch time

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.150 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to people standing
by their internal truths.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yep, that's true.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't,
then what do we have?

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What do we have?

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: We just
go into the masses.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.380 align:middle line:90%
We have a repeat of history.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And we already know how
some of these have gone.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.360 align:middle line:84%
So let us find that
strength and not

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.455 align:middle line:84%
falling into an indoctrination
but rather the individuation.

00:18:30.455 --> 00:18:32.450 align:middle line:90%
The individuation is painful.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.250 align:middle line:90%
It can be.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say, call it
out to be painful for everybody.

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.230 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be painful it just

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.030 align:middle line:90%
requires such a conviction.

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And Jung taught
deeply about, we must

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.460 align:middle line:84%
individuate before
we can actually

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.650 align:middle line:90%
do group consciousness.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.360 align:middle line:90%
And this is really true.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it feels good
to be of like mind

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.516 align:middle line:90%
and with people that are--

00:18:56.516 --> 00:18:58.640 align:middle line:84%
we're moving in
the same direction.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And also asking ourselves what
needs to be reformed right now?

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.550 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot that
needs to be reformed,

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and astrologically speaking,
we're in this time.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And you know what's
also interesting is

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.230 align:middle line:90%
in Steiner's look of--

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Rudolf Steiner's look at
some of the astrology,

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.600 align:middle line:84%
we're in the same
time that the Essenes

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:25.550 align:middle line:84%
were when their whole
community was taken apart.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And we had to-- they
had to see the truth.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to go to
safe places so creating

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:35.570 align:middle line:84%
parallel structures
is also the answer

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:37.250 align:middle line:90%
to getting out of menticide.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:42.180 align:middle line:84%
There is an Afterskool, After
S-K-O-O-L, those videos.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.400 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.980 align:middle line:84%
I love that site and
what they put out.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.432 align:middle line:84%
And it was called
"Mass Psychosis."

00:19:48.432 --> 00:19:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: "Mass Psychosis."

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You saw it?

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yep.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.200 align:middle line:84%
I would encourage anybody
that hasn't seen it to go to--

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.850 align:middle line:84%
on YouTube, Afterskool, and the
keywords are mass psychosis.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And what you just said
really triggered it for me,

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and that is, as they get toward
the end of explaining how

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:09.410 align:middle line:84%
it happens and they did it
so beautifully, as you are,

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.600 align:middle line:84%
they said in the
end, you're not going

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.760 align:middle line:84%
to stop psychopaths
or narcissists.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: No.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you can
create parallel structures,

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.340 align:middle line:84%
parallel societies,
and we'll get

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:84%
to that toward the end because
that's more-- the healing

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.440 align:middle line:84%
element, but not
to despair here.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.910 align:middle line:84%
So meanwhile, we're on
this propaganda wagon.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.830 align:middle line:84%
We're watching communities
and families split apart.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And doubt is, as you call it,
the on-ramp to that doubt.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.520 align:middle line:90%
And so now, this can go to--

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.790 align:middle line:84%
this leads to the subject we
mentioned earlier, gaslighting.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:45.320 align:middle line:84%
This has become a
really common phenomena

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.580 align:middle line:84%
not just from within
relationships of individuals

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.130 align:middle line:84%
but from institutions,
politicians, I mean,

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.340 align:middle line:90%
it's just awful.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.882 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, some
people have heard the term

00:20:55.882 --> 00:20:57.090 align:middle line:90%
but don't know what it means.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So talk about
gaslighting for a moment,

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.770 align:middle line:90%
explain what it is first.

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And while
it's top of mind,

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I want to mention
that it's like--

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.070 align:middle line:84%
there's a scientific
experiment that

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:11.910 align:middle line:84%
was done where you put frogs
in water and it's cool water.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And you start to
turn up the heat.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, the frogs don't jump
out because it's so gradual.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.260 align:middle line:90%
You don't even know it.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.800 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what's happening.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.102 align:middle line:84%
So gaslighting can sneak
up on you a little bit.

00:21:23.102 --> 00:21:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain
what it is first,

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and let's talk about
how it sneaks up.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So gaslighting is when
you know something

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.130 align:middle line:84%
to be true in
yourself and somebody

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:84%
is telling you that's not
true, it's not reality.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a crazy-making tactic.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:43.190 align:middle line:84%
It's intent-- the
person is actually--

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:48.350 align:middle line:84%
it's an emotional abuse with
manipulation at its core.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's looking,
and the goal of it

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.890 align:middle line:84%
is to overpower and to
control another person.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And so, there's
actually a play, I

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.700 align:middle line:84%
think it was done
in 1938 or '39,

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.820 align:middle line:84%
that was also turned into
a movie about gaslighting.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And one of the examples
that's in that play

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:12.500 align:middle line:84%
is where the man who
is the protagonist

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.390 align:middle line:90%
is telling his wife--

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:84%
she wants to turn out a
light that's flickering.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And he says, that
light's not flickering,

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.820 align:middle line:90%
that light is flickering.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.670 align:middle line:10%
Well, anybody-- yes, the
light was flickering,

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.670 align:middle line:10%
but he tells her to
the point that she

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:32.750 align:middle line:10%
starts to go mad that that
light isn't flickering.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:36.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a benign example,
but you are being told

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:37.702 align:middle line:90%
that down is up and up is down.

00:22:37.702 --> 00:22:39.493 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
having this everywhere,

00:22:39.493 --> 00:22:41.120 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
science right now.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.610 align:middle line:84%
There's this raging
debate going on,

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:47.630 align:middle line:84%
and you have statistics
actually turned upside down.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Case studies turned upside
down in one media outlet

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and then turn the
other way in another.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And how is anyone--
why shouldn't people

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.350 align:middle line:84%
say, I'm totally
confused and don't

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.990 align:middle line:84%
know what to believe
anymore, especially when

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.390 align:middle line:84%
we're coming to the world
of science too which

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.490 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to have a
little bit more objectivity.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:08.250 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to have, but we
know it doesn't necessarily.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:09.890 align:middle line:90%
It depends who funds the study.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:10.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.447 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Most definitely.

00:23:11.447 --> 00:23:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I have
a saying that science

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.195 align:middle line:90%
has been hijacked by industry.

00:23:15.195 --> 00:23:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Like the mystics
were hijacked by religion.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.330 align:middle line:84%
We have the same
thing playing out now.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, you can
actually take statistics

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and make it say anything
you want it to say, right?

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:35.000 align:middle line:84%
But true scientists, there
are many of them that

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.567 align:middle line:90%
are becoming whistleblowers.

00:23:36.567 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:84%
There's many of them
that are speaking

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:39.733 align:middle line:84%
truths, that are
writing open letters,

00:23:39.733 --> 00:23:41.435 align:middle line:84%
putting their
reputations on the line.

00:23:41.435 --> 00:23:42.477 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, there are.

00:23:42.477 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: There's a lot
and-- oh, God bless them--

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:51.020 align:middle line:84%
because we need this call
to honesty, call to truth.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And when we're confused, we
don't know what truth is.

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:59.240 align:middle line:84%
But internally, we do
know what truth is.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So the gaslighter,
to go back to that,

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%
is essentially
telling you what you

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:84%
believe to be true isn't and
their reality is the truth.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And you need to conform
to their reality.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is an
epidemic right now.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: That's the pandemic.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.952 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah the
pandemic is gaslighting.

00:24:17.952 --> 00:24:19.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And one of the tactics too
is to obscure change topics,

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:25.813 align:middle line:84%
so you forget where you
were, think, wait a minute,

00:24:25.813 --> 00:24:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we were talking
about that, and, boom,

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.320 align:middle line:84%
you're on to something
else entirely.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Open loop.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.560 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: It's an open loop.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.227 align:middle line:90%
So it's another way to--

00:24:34.227 --> 00:24:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like
a bait and switch.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: It is.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:38.840 align:middle line:90%
And you watch--

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't even watch
the news, not any outlet.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.280 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:43.970 align:middle line:90%
No more.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:45.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And I try to find people who
I think have reasonable minds

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and are independent thinkers
and follow their columns

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And even so, that is reinforcing
your own point of view

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.440 align:middle line:90%
to a certain extent.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.690 align:middle line:90%
OK, let me bring that part in.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.760 align:middle line:84%
That's another part
of the problem.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:05.660 align:middle line:84%
The film "The Social
Dilemma," right?

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.360 align:middle line:84%
How we are reinforcing
our preferences

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.230 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Where does that come into the
notion of being propagandized,

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.780 align:middle line:90%
gaslit, manipulated?

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Technology.

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:23.480 align:middle line:84%
This is Meerloo's point
about how with the advent

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.720 align:middle line:84%
of television, what you're
able to do is hijack the mind.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.850 align:middle line:84%
You get somebody--
have you ever tried

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.745 align:middle line:84%
speaking to a kid when they
are so deeply into something?

00:25:31.745 --> 00:25:33.620 align:middle line:84%
No matter how many times
you call their name,

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.287 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
get their attention.

00:25:35.287 --> 00:25:36.470 align:middle line:90%
They're in a trance.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a perfect
state of neutrality.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.248 align:middle line:84%
Now, we all love
entertainment like anybody

00:25:41.248 --> 00:25:42.290 align:middle line:90%
else loves entertainment.

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.370 align:middle line:90%
A good movie is fantastic.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:47.037 align:middle line:84%
I love the Marvel movies because
there's elements of truth and--

00:25:47.037 --> 00:25:48.703 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, there
are a few good ones.

00:25:48.703 --> 00:25:50.405 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: --heroism,
and there's so--

00:25:50.405 --> 00:25:52.820 align:middle line:84%
there's such good truth
telling in there, and--

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, there
are some good ones.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.187 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: --we need
to find our superpower--

00:25:55.187 --> 00:25:56.978 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think we're
looking for-- we're

00:25:56.978 --> 00:25:59.030 align:middle line:84%
heroes in our-- we're
looking for our own heroes,

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.613 align:middle line:84%
and we're looking
for the hero within,

00:26:00.613 --> 00:26:02.553 align:middle line:84%
and we can cheer
them on, and hope

00:26:02.553 --> 00:26:04.220 align:middle line:84%
that we have a little
bit of that in us,

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.600 align:middle line:84%
but go ahead with
what you're saying.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: That's true.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually
what it takes.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a heroic effort
in order to get out

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:15.390 align:middle line:84%
of a gaslighting or narcissistic
relationship in that regard.

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So it takes that empowered
movement to, wow,

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, I am starting to see this.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And with us having
a conversation

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.800 align:middle line:84%
about it and it being much more
prevalent today where people

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.945 align:middle line:90%
are saying, that's gaslighting.

00:26:32.945 --> 00:26:35.510 align:middle line:84%
There is an aspect of
"The Social Dilemma,"

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.070 align:middle line:90%
that is happening as well.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.650 align:middle line:90%
This-- what is it?

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
algorithmic reinforcement

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:42.230 align:middle line:90%
of your preferences.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.750 align:middle line:84%
You don't hear any kind of
opposition to your story.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:48.620 align:middle line:84%
It keeps refining and refining
what it's going to feed you.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it's
interesting when you're

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.200 align:middle line:84%
trying to find
sovereignty of mind

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.350 align:middle line:84%
when you're choosing to
have your own preferences

00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:00.710 align:middle line:84%
reinforced, meaning you're
not allowing outside data

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:02.040 align:middle line:90%
or points of view in.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So my favorite
phrase is something

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:84%
that Paul and I say a lot as
well is, that's interesting.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So when something comes up, it's
like doing a pattern interrupt

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.900 align:middle line:84%
to it because those
preferences, they're

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.580 align:middle line:90%
looking for little hooks.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And those little hooks
are what can take you

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:22.070 align:middle line:84%
on the rabbit trail of
where they want you to go,

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:24.050 align:middle line:90%
and that discernment, that--

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.360 align:middle line:84%
you're staying
true to ourselves,

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.920 align:middle line:84%
and realizing, ah,
that's what's happening.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So it takes an
observer's point of view.

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Backing out a
little bit and being

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:38.660 align:middle line:84%
able to not go full steam
into what another's agenda is.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And also, as I was just
mentioning a minute ago,

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.990 align:middle line:84%
we have to be careful not to
do that even with ourselves

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:46.020 align:middle line:90%
in a certain way.

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.900 align:middle line:84%
This is where it gets
tricky because, as you say,

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.580 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to allow someone
else's version of reality

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:56.630 align:middle line:84%
or us that just contradicts
our internal gnosis to have

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:59.910 align:middle line:84%
an influence to the point
of where we're confused

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:01.790 align:middle line:90%
and we're ineffective.

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:03.660 align:middle line:84%
We can't make clear
decisions anymore.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.690 align:middle line:84%
We don't want that,
but we don't want

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to put ourselves in a situation
where we're so narrowed down

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:13.370 align:middle line:84%
in our single-minded preferences
that our own minds can't

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:15.237 align:middle line:84%
operate and broaden
out anymore either.

00:28:15.237 --> 00:28:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
kind of both sides

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:18.620 align:middle line:90%
are being challenged right now.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: I mean,
we're in a tough spot.

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:26.330 align:middle line:84%
This is go-time for humanity
to wake up and become

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:28.160 align:middle line:90%
the initiate.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.490 align:middle line:84%
There's a Hopi prophecy
that was sent to me.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I think it's White
Eagle, and we're

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.140 align:middle line:90%
saying a lot of the same things.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.930 align:middle line:84%
When I read this prophecy, I
was like, oh, this is exactly--

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:42.710 align:middle line:84%
and he says it's either
a door or a hole.

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:46.760 align:middle line:90%
And we're at that place now.

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.290 align:middle line:90%
What are you choosing?

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean to be
a broken record here,

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.450 align:middle line:90%
but that is the thing.

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:57.500 align:middle line:84%
We must engage our
ability to choose and find

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:58.610 align:middle line:90%
that sovereignty.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
will say, well,

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that is.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.330 align:middle line:84%
That's an inside
job because even

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:09.710 align:middle line:84%
as somebody that helps people
on the path as everybody

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:14.500 align:middle line:84%
that you talk to is
essentially wanting to do,

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.070 align:middle line:84%
you can guide a person but
it's their internal compass

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.955 align:middle line:84%
that needs to be
reactivated and turned on.

00:29:19.955 --> 00:29:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:23.413 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: There's only so much
you can do for another human.

00:29:23.413 --> 00:29:26.000 align:middle line:84%
They have to want it
and engage with it.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.810 align:middle line:84%
But that comfort
even with people

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:31.310 align:middle line:84%
who are empaths and narcissists
that are in a relationship--

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're going to
get to that, well, right now.

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:34.660 align:middle line:90%
Let's go for it.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:37.720 align:middle line:84%
You said empaths
and narcissists are

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.000 align:middle line:84%
finding each other
now, and creating

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.057 align:middle line:84%
alliances and relationships
collectively and individually.

00:29:44.057 --> 00:29:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So is this
really in a bigger number

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.790 align:middle line:84%
or do we just have now
more of an understanding

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.320 align:middle line:90%
of these kind of behaviors?

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think with--
it's a good question.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I don't know.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:54.892 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: I don't have
the answer to it either.

00:29:54.892 --> 00:29:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm seeing clairvoyantly
right now when I look at,

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:00.700 align:middle line:90%
is this a numbers thing?

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Is this a behavioral
type of thing?

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.240 align:middle line:90%
Is this just another label?

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.810 align:middle line:84%
But I have a lot of people
that contact me for,

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:10.480 align:middle line:84%
oh, I just discovered I'm
a high-sensitivity person.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm an empath.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.950 align:middle line:84%
They've got this
label for it now.

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:15.970 align:middle line:90%
It's-- OK.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:17.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm a recovering empath.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So I think we can both have deep
conversations on this, right?

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So what I see is
this Mobius strip.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:26.560 align:middle line:90%
This is the vision that I had.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's what was--
a Mobius strip is--

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:31.750 align:middle line:84%
it's a three-dimensional
or multidimensional shape

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.940 align:middle line:84%
where you-- what
was on the bottom

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.770 align:middle line:84%
is now on the top
and vice versa.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:38.075 align:middle line:90%
And so, what we're seeing--

00:30:38.075 --> 00:30:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Also called
an infinity loop.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: It is
an infinity loop.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:41.708 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Absolutely.

00:30:41.708 --> 00:30:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And so but this pinch that we're
at right in the middle right

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:46.990 align:middle line:84%
now is this
incredible discomfort

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.420 align:middle line:84%
of having the realization,
oh my god, I'm

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.220 align:middle line:90%
in a narcissistic relationship.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, I'm a
high-sensitivity person.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.180 align:middle line:90%
I hate being called sensitive.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god, I'm an empath.

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:57.850 align:middle line:90%
What do I do now?

00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:58.650 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's great that
this awakening

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:02.890 align:middle line:90%
is happening in this, who am I?

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And why is it such an
increase in numbers?

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.300 align:middle line:84%
It's because we need
all hands on deck

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and we need the emotional
sensitivity now.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:16.420 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to be so mental.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.610 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
menticide can grab

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:22.000 align:middle line:84%
all of these
illusions of grandeur

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.888 align:middle line:84%
that we have or just
illusions, period.

00:31:23.888 --> 00:31:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and where
you can misuse the mind

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:27.460 align:middle line:90%
toward things like gaslighting.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.050 align:middle line:90%
That's a very mental process.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:30.640 align:middle line:90%
It's not kind.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And I-- and you said, is
this a numbers thing or what?

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.570 align:middle line:84%
I think it must be gaining
in numbers because I'm

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:42.130 align:middle line:84%
seeing articles pop up in some
of the strangest mainstream

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.650 align:middle line:84%
places about gaslighting,
specifically.

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:46.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's coming up
in conversation where

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:48.340 align:middle line:84%
two or three years
ago most people

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.987 align:middle line:84%
had never heard the
term, and certainly

00:31:49.987 --> 00:31:51.070 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what it meant.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's pretty common
even if a lot of people

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:54.700 align:middle line:90%
are misusing it.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.772 align:middle line:84%
There's-- it's still part of
our vernacular now for a reason.

00:31:57.772 --> 00:31:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Absolutely.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And what I will
speak to here is,

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.940 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of clients
who were gaslit as a child.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And when we say,
drop into your heart

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.100 align:middle line:90%
and seek the light of truth.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:15.050 align:middle line:90%
Put truth in your life.

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you were a
child who was gaslit,

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:25.590 align:middle line:84%
you may not understand that
up is really up and down

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:26.390 align:middle line:90%
is really down.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: That
really is a confusion.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a false platform.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Right.

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And then as an adult, if you're
in one of those situations,

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.740 align:middle line:84%
you are being called to
action for what do you

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.920 align:middle line:90%
know to be true?

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.650 align:middle line:90%
And now, how do you navigate?

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Appropriate boundaries,
discernment,

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.150 align:middle line:84%
being able to make
healthy choices,

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:47.630 align:middle line:84%
choosing yourself
first, loving others

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:50.390 align:middle line:84%
from the overflow of the love
that you have for yourself,

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:52.040 align:middle line:90%
not rescuing people.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:57.655 align:middle line:84%
That's the magnetic pull of
the narcissist and the empath.

00:32:57.655 --> 00:32:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do they both
have to learn if you're

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.340 align:middle line:90%
going to put it in a capsule?

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So the narcissist is actually
learning about emotions

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:09.350 align:middle line:84%
and learning how to become
sensitive because the actual--

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:11.300 align:middle line:84%
if you were to take
it apart and look

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:14.540 align:middle line:84%
what was it going on in that
narcissist's early life,

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.060 align:middle line:84%
there was a sensitivity
there that was denied.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Or it was beat the
crap out of, right?

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:24.290 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't-- it was
misunderstood and ill-directed,

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:25.142 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:33:25.142 --> 00:33:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they had to
form their own sense of self

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:28.460 align:middle line:90%
in whatever way they could.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Right.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, they're
the ones that were

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:32.480 align:middle line:90%
the bullies in the classes.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.300 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that
sought to overpower another

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.060 align:middle line:84%
because they were so
underpowered in their life

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:41.690 align:middle line:84%
at home or in another
facet of their life

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:44.400 align:middle line:84%
that they needed to
figure out, well,

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.700 align:middle line:84%
I need to have some
power structure here.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.420 align:middle line:90%
And hurt people, hurt people.

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.220 align:middle line:90%
They will.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.270 align:middle line:90%
That's not permission.

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:52.770 align:middle line:90%
But that is what will happen.

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:84%
It's just this
trickle-down effect.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And in this C pinch,
now we're in the choice.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I am not choosing to do
what has been done to me.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I am not going to
continue on this--

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:04.745 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Break this cycle.

00:34:04.745 --> 00:34:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: --karmic journey.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.780 align:middle line:84%
I've got my own dharma
to live, what is it?

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.449 align:middle line:84%
That's the biggest question
that we get to ask ourselves.

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.210 align:middle line:84%
You just talked about
what the narcissist has

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:16.790 align:middle line:84%
to learn in some of the
underpinnings of narcissism

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:17.900 align:middle line:90%
from childhood.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what the
empaths have to learn.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So the
empaths are known--

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:24.500 align:middle line:84%
they know that
they're sensitive.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.150 align:middle line:90%
They're feeling everything.

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And they may have not come
up like adult children

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.960 align:middle line:90%
of alcoholics, right?

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.350 align:middle line:90%
ACA-type people.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:38.949 align:middle line:84%
They had to learn,
how do I navigate

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:42.190 align:middle line:84%
in this environment that
feels very unsafe right now?

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So you're not just reading
how you feel, you're reading,

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:47.350 align:middle line:84%
is it safe to come
out of my room?

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Is it safe to come
out of the closet?

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.670 align:middle line:90%
Can I put this book down?

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:52.840 align:middle line:90%
Should I go in the house?

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.900 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
are coming up

00:34:55.900 --> 00:35:00.410 align:middle line:84%
for them reading the tea
leaves of, is it safe?

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's this
turned-on sensitivity.

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:05.425 align:middle line:84%
And there's the--
it's interesting.

00:35:05.425 --> 00:35:07.675 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're also
often pleasers as a result.

00:35:07.675 --> 00:35:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Rescuers
and pleasers.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You want
everybody to be happy.

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:12.033 align:middle line:90%
You can't take the stress.

00:35:12.033 --> 00:35:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Rescuers
and pleasers.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:14.350 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And anxiety oftentimes
is borne out of that

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:21.040 align:middle line:84%
because there's an anxiety
that can show itself

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:25.090 align:middle line:84%
as like an absorption of
everybody's emotions and/or

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:26.680 align:middle line:90%
it can come out of control.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:30.160 align:middle line:90%
So you can actually have this--

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.280 align:middle line:84%
it's a two-edged sword because
I know many empaths that

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.200 align:middle line:84%
are staying in
those relationships

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.442 align:middle line:84%
because it's where they feel
they have a job and value.

00:35:38.442 --> 00:35:40.150 align:middle line:84%
They're staying-- the
empaths are staying

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:43.990 align:middle line:84%
in unhealthy relationships
because there's a sense of,

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:45.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing good here.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:46.420 align:middle line:90%
I can help.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: I can help.

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's all they
ever wanted to do,

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.250 align:middle line:84%
but because they
were so misunderstood

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:53.560 align:middle line:84%
in other relationships
or in their childhood,

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:58.000 align:middle line:84%
this was a way that they got to
have a freedom of expression.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.150 align:middle line:84%
But most of them are
denying who they really are.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:04.360 align:middle line:84%
They're living for other,
not living for themselves.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.300 align:middle line:90%
And don't have boundaries.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.100 align:middle line:90%
That's a big one.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.240 align:middle line:90%
They don't have any boundaries.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what they're
here learning, so the--

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To understand for
yourself and learn to when

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.870 align:middle line:90%
to say no, and to not--

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:20.260 align:middle line:84%
I think for empaths, a lot of it
is, how to stand for yourself,

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.990 align:middle line:84%
how to create your boundaries,
but not shut your heart down

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:25.330 align:middle line:84%
because of the pain
and disillusionment.

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Keep the heart open
and create boundaries.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a huge
challenge for a lot of humanity

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:31.630 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: It is.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.215 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, you look--
like the friends you've lost

00:36:35.215 --> 00:36:38.680 align:middle line:84%
and associations you've lost
because of all the conflicted

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.550 align:middle line:90%
thinking right now.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:40.530 align:middle line:90%
I have too.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to then
slip into judgment

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:45.100 align:middle line:90%
and start losing your love.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's not it either.

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: No.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:50.170 align:middle line:84%
We need to find
the path of love.

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:52.060 align:middle line:84%
How would some of
the master teachers

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:55.040 align:middle line:84%
that you've known in
your life deal with this?

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.440 align:middle line:84%
What's the next
right thing to do?

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I said this at
the very beginning of the show,

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.830 align:middle line:90%
this isn't just about us.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Our collective
emotional field is

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:09.410 align:middle line:84%
intertwined with Earth's
own emotional dimension.

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:12.310 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that now because it's

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:13.570 align:middle line:90%
the chicken or the egg.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Is it the cosmos?

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:15.310 align:middle line:90%
Is it the Earth?

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Is it us?

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Is everyone going
crazy together?

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Is this chaos?

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:20.890 align:middle line:90%
Where is the chaos coming from?

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:22.510 align:middle line:90%
But it is a time of chaos.

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:24.940 align:middle line:84%
So talk about that
interrelationship

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.210 align:middle line:90%
with our lovely planet.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:28.970 align:middle line:84%
It's-- I think this
is really interesting.

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:31.600 align:middle line:84%
This is another
clairvoyant vision I had

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.580 align:middle line:84%
of this increase in numbers,
of this Mobius, this moving

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:39.040 align:middle line:84%
from what was below,
what was in the descent

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.750 align:middle line:90%
before is now on top, et cetera.

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:44.950 align:middle line:84%
So when we are
being in our power,

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:47.170 align:middle line:84%
we're actually helping
our Mother Earth,

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:49.540 align:middle line:84%
our beloved goddess,
Mother Earth.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.460 align:middle line:84%
When we are taking
responsibility

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:58.490 align:middle line:84%
for our emotions, this is
a blessing in so many ways.

00:37:58.490 --> 00:37:59.980 align:middle line:84%
But there's
something else that I

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.910 align:middle line:84%
see that has to do with
our own methylation.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So methylation are our pathways
to be able to even detox

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.830 align:middle line:90%
our bodies, right?

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So when we think about
the fracking of the earth

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:17.170 align:middle line:84%
that we have been doing, the
planetary bodies, if you will,

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:20.733 align:middle line:84%
are a mimic of our
fields, you could say.

00:38:20.733 --> 00:38:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, I've
often wondered,

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:24.460 align:middle line:84%
why from a bio-field
sciences point of view,

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.105 align:middle line:84%
why don't we have
a map of this yet.

00:38:26.105 --> 00:38:26.980 align:middle line:90%
I am working on this.

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:31.000 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have a full
understanding of that

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.190 align:middle line:84%
we-- from an astrophysics
point of view,

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:34.510 align:middle line:90%
we know the troposphere.

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:35.620 align:middle line:90%
We know the magnetosphere.

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:36.670 align:middle line:90%
We know the ionosphere.

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:39.200 align:middle line:84%
We know that there's different
properties within them.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So the earth has
this ability to be

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.620 align:middle line:84%
able to have compost
our emotions to take it.

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of my favorite
grounding exercises

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:50.140 align:middle line:84%
is to imagine that
you've got roots

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.870 align:middle line:84%
that are coming out of your
waist, not just your feet.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:55.420 align:middle line:84%
But they help us to
dump off the things that

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:59.620 align:middle line:84%
are no longer serving
because our beloved Earth has

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.270 align:middle line:90%
the ability to compost it.

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:02.920 align:middle line:84%
What she doesn't
have the ability

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.120 align:middle line:84%
to do is deal with the
fracking and all of this--

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.700 align:middle line:84%
the damming up of things,
of ruining waterways,

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.840 align:middle line:90%
of polluting--

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Incredibly invasive,
even violent actions.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: That's the
genocide that we've

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:18.490 align:middle line:90%
been doing to our Earth.

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's very
much a real thing.

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And when we think about
it and we couple it

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:25.040 align:middle line:84%
with the menticide
of what's going on.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about
power and control.

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And we're thinking that we
can have dominion in that way.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.790 align:middle line:84%
That's just-- it's
such a fallacy,

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:36.170 align:middle line:90%
but yet we're in it right now.

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:38.890 align:middle line:84%
So shining the
light of truth on,

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:42.340 align:middle line:84%
should I be dumping this
right here right now?

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's emotional
baggage or whether meaning

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.650 align:middle line:90%
to a group of people.

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Or should I be processing it?

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:55.180 align:middle line:90%
What can I process myself?

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the key before
you even do a grounding

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:58.480 align:middle line:90%
exercise.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.680 align:middle line:90%
Process what it is.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.670 align:middle line:84%
What was the intention about
having that interaction

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:07.480 align:middle line:84%
with the person that we were
intending to teach ourselves

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.190 align:middle line:90%
in that moment?

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, as we process it, get
the gold out of that situation.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And then release what
the whole scenario was.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:20.800 align:middle line:90%
That's the letting go.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And also, when we're looking at
these larger patterns of where

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:27.310 align:middle line:84%
we are right now in
this chaotic time

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:29.410 align:middle line:90%
is in childhood development.

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:31.000 align:middle line:84%
They always say
that before there's

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.040 align:middle line:84%
a breakthrough and
a movement upward,

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.380 align:middle line:84%
there's a regressive
state, and that we

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:38.050 align:middle line:84%
go into a bit of a regression,
suck our thumb for a little bit

00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:39.520 align:middle line:84%
before we break
through and let go

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.480 align:middle line:84%
of the binkie and the
blanket and everything.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like
there might be some

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:45.110 align:middle line:84%
of that going on too
because in a way,

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:48.550 align:middle line:84%
it seems as though we have
digressed on a scale of just

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:53.170 align:middle line:84%
consideration, kindness,
gentlemanly, gentlewomanliness.

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Those are values that seem to
be left behind in my father's

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:58.750 align:middle line:90%
generation by now.

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:01.820 align:middle line:90%
And those were useful values.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:02.620 align:middle line:90%
You don't see that.

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not reflected in
the media or anywhere.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:07.888 align:middle line:84%
So I think we've been in a
bit of a regressive stage.

00:41:07.888 --> 00:41:09.805 align:middle line:84%
It means we're ready to
throw away the binkie.

00:41:09.805 --> 00:41:10.605 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:41:10.605 --> 00:41:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes,
I totally agree.

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I wanted to
ask you a quick question.

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.987 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end, I want
to ask you about a film.

00:41:15.987 --> 00:41:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So you and Paul are
teaching a class on personal

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:20.650 align:middle line:90%
self-integration during--

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:21.920 align:middle line:90%
in the midst of all this.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit
about what you do.

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.680 align:middle line:90%
It's-- you know the--

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't expect it
but what emerged out

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.790 align:middle line:84%
of the personal
self-integration and what

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:33.850 align:middle line:84%
personal self-integration is, is
the meeting of our subconscious

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:35.620 align:middle line:90%
selves and our inner child.

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And we have more than just
the flesh, blood, and bones

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.230 align:middle line:90%
and regular subconscious.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:45.790 align:middle line:84%
There's more to it of who's the
archetype of our mental sphere?

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Who's the archetype
of our emotional body?

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And in those regions,
our body self.

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:54.610 align:middle line:84%
These are aspects of us
that have an intelligence,

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:56.620 align:middle line:90%
an innate knowing.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:00.040 align:middle line:84%
But they can be also part
of us, that's the binkie--

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.620 align:middle line:84%
sucking our thumb,
not wanting to grow up

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.690 align:middle line:84%
or having some
recalcitrants around that.

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:08.200 align:middle line:84%
What emerged out of the
course was this sovereignty.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And many enlightenment
experiences

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:13.450 align:middle line:90%
came of people just--

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:15.820 align:middle line:90%
wow, I am not the body.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:16.930 align:middle line:90%
It was just so clear.

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:19.150 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't necessarily,
yes, I mean

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:21.857 align:middle line:84%
we intend that for all of us
and it's not-- unfortunately,

00:42:21.857 --> 00:42:23.440 align:middle line:84%
it's not one of these
things like it's

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.607 align:middle line:84%
a poster you put on your
wall, like a diploma, like,

00:42:25.607 --> 00:42:26.500 align:middle line:90%
OK, I got it.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:27.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm enlightened, I'm good.

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:31.120 align:middle line:84%
No, this is a continual
place of work for us

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.160 align:middle line:84%
because values,
as you mentioned,

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.130 align:middle line:84%
that being nice, being
gentlemanly, being womanly,

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:37.960 align:middle line:90%
being kind, all of that.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.490 align:middle line:90%
These are our value systems.

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, much of that is how it is
that we behave subconsciously.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And what are we putting into
motion with our thoughts,

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.240 align:middle line:84%
what we're putting
out in the world,

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.720 align:middle line:90%
and how it is that we operate.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeking and do with
personal self-integration

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:00.740 align:middle line:84%
to make the
unconscious conscious.

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.565 align:middle line:84%
Back to that original
quote of Carl Jung--

00:43:02.565 --> 00:43:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Jung, yeah.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.625 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: --which I think
is so timely right now.

00:43:05.625 --> 00:43:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And we have to see
our part, where

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:11.930 align:middle line:84%
we are-- where are we in
this generational structure

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:14.120 align:middle line:90%
of evolution or devolution?

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.010 align:middle line:90%
Where are we in it?

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:15.810 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:19.370 align:middle line:84%
I watched my father
and his friends.

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:21.290 align:middle line:84%
He's in an assisted
care facility.

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:23.570 align:middle line:84%
He's 91 and he
needs a lot of help.

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And we see him a lot, and he
talks about his social life

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.950 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:29.720 align:middle line:84%
But when you watch them,
the people are courteous.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.670 align:middle line:84%
There's still the
old-fashioned courtesy.

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:36.080 align:middle line:84%
When you look at what's
happening out and about right

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.120 align:middle line:84%
now in the streets,
it's not very kind

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.410 align:middle line:90%
and courteous a lot of times.

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think we can look
to the older generation

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.220 align:middle line:84%
to bring back a certain
level of refinement.

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.980 align:middle line:84%
As an external to
all of this, just

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.620 align:middle line:84%
bring back a little bit of
consideration and kindness

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and courteousness and
truth And then blend it

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:56.630 align:middle line:84%
with what you're saying,
this deep inner work,

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:58.370 align:middle line:84%
and I think we're
going to be fine.

00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:59.630 align:middle line:90%
We just have to find it again.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:01.297 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And finding
that compassion.

00:44:01.297 --> 00:44:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And the beautiful thing
about being an empath

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:06.320 align:middle line:84%
is the sensitivity to feeling
what others are feeling.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.870 align:middle line:84%
But you don't want to lose
yourself in the midst of that.

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:13.130 align:middle line:10%
So it can be a bridge
to helping compassion

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:16.355 align:middle line:10%
be what is the leading force.

00:44:16.355 --> 00:44:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And so but we're not
meant to lose ourselves--

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:20.987 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: --in that.

00:44:20.987 --> 00:44:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So the being kind, if we could
just get back to what that is

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:31.880 align:middle line:84%
or just find it for
ourselves, and emulate,

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.530 align:middle line:84%
put it out there in
every way that we can.

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:36.470 align:middle line:90%
It's called for right now.

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.945 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: It is.

00:44:36.945 --> 00:44:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In spades.

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.587 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to share have
you seen the movie, "Free

00:44:39.587 --> 00:44:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Guy" with Ryan Reynolds?

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: No.

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:44.360 align:middle line:90%
I love that film.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.730 align:middle line:84%
It's in the theaters, and
it'll be on video soon,

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:47.970 align:middle line:90%
and I'm sure on streaming.

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:50.350 align:middle line:90%
But I won't tell--

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:52.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to give
any of the plot away.

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:53.870 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous characters.

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Very original
screenplay concept.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.430 align:middle line:90%
Great CGI.

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:02.990 align:middle line:84%
But it's about average
person claiming their freedom

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:05.240 align:middle line:84%
underneath these
powers of control--

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.620 align:middle line:90%
these systems of control.

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.670 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's sweet and
it has love in it.

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:11.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just one of
the bright spots

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:13.530 align:middle line:84%
that I'm finding in
entertainment right now.

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Fantastic.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I just wanted
to share that with you

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.230 align:middle line:90%
and share it with everybody.

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:17.147 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Thank you.

00:45:17.147 --> 00:45:18.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to know it.

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So Tiffany,
thank you so much

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.160 align:middle line:84%
just for putting sanity
around what we're all

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.930 align:middle line:90%
encountering every day.

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:27.380 align:middle line:84%
You're always very clear in
your articulation of themes that

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:29.460 align:middle line:90%
get all jumbled inside people.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:30.500 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Oh, well.

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:34.133 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: I appreciate having
the forum with you because you

00:45:34.133 --> 00:45:36.620 align:middle line:84%
are very clear, and you help
a lot of people to shine

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:38.393 align:middle line:84%
the light of truth
where we need to have--

00:45:38.393 --> 00:45:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
we're trying to do here.

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: --the light shone.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:41.450 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:44.073 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you so
much, and until next time.

00:45:44.073 --> 00:45:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Until next time.

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I hope this has been
helpful for any of you who

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:50.210 align:middle line:84%
have been feeling a
little bit crazy lately.
