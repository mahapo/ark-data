00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Perhaps
one of the strangest phenomena

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.270 align:middle line:10%
among humans is what
we call walk-ins.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.440 align:middle line:10%
This occurs when a
soul is ready to depart

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.720 align:middle line:10%
a body with another
soul waiting to enter

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.460 align:middle line:10%
the same body within
a split second.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:84%
This is said to generally
occur among younger people when

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:84%
the soul of the one
born in one body

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.290 align:middle line:84%
decides their job is done
and turns the vehicle over

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:84%
to another soul who
wants to short-circuit

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.160 align:middle line:84%
the process of maturation to get
on with a task here on Earth.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas David Ngan says
he is one of these souls.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Having a clear directive in life
with his soul contract work,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.420 align:middle line:84%
he began hearing similar
stories in others

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and created a network
for people who

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.900 align:middle line:90%
believe they may be walk-ins.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.255 align:middle line:84%
David, I've talked to you
via Skype from England.

00:01:12.255 --> 00:01:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's wonderful to
have you here on the show.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you're enjoying
your time in the US.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And I've always found the
subject of walk-ins intriguing.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And living in Sedona,
Arizona, that's no surprise.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not an uncommon thing
to even talk about there.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very complex
and very real subject.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.270 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to ask you
to begin the conversation

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.520 align:middle line:84%
with telling us
how you initially

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.290 align:middle line:84%
began feeling like something
was different in your own life

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and how you discovered
this about yourself.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NICHOLAS DAVID NGAN: Well,
I'd always felt different from

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.505 align:middle line:90%
most people.

00:01:50.505 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:10%
And I thought that was normal.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.710 align:middle line:10%
I looked at my family when
I was a child thinking,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.800 align:middle line:10%
these aren't my real parents.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:10%
Someone hasn't
told me something.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.040 align:middle line:10%
There's a secret that
someone hasn't told me.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'd look at the stars,
I'd be looking for home.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You were looking
to the stars for home?

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: Yeah.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.310 align:middle line:90%
I was looking for home.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew
something wasn't right,

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.550 align:middle line:90%
that this Earth wasn't home.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:84%
These weren't my family,
like I was adopted,

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle line:90%
or I was a visitor.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.095 align:middle line:90%
That's how I felt.

00:02:20.095 --> 00:02:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I had this big question
mark my entire life of, why

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.680 align:middle line:90%
don't I fit in?

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Why do people do all
these strange things,

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:90%
why don't they tell the truth?

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.929 align:middle line:84%
And I used to go around
telling the truth all the time

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:35.420 align:middle line:84%
and get myself in
a lot of trouble.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.660 align:middle line:84%
But I thought that's
what you should do.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:90%
You should tell the truth.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
nothing but that.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking
for my real family.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.270 align:middle line:84%
I knew there were
people out there who

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.290 align:middle line:84%
I could open to and
be connected to.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Because I hadn't
found any of them yet.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And people seem to be
like on remote control,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.229 align:middle line:84%
just going through
the motions in life.

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't doing the
best that they could either.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.103 align:middle line:84%
They were doing less
conscious things.

00:03:01.103 --> 00:03:03.630 align:middle line:90%
They were exploiting others.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.140 align:middle line:84%
They were not really engaging
with how life should be,

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.720 align:middle line:90%
I thought.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I was in a spiritual
workshop when I was about 30

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:84%
with my teacher,
Frank Alper, who

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.195 align:middle line:84%
taught me the soul
contract work.

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And he spoke about
walk-ins, about,

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.100 align:middle line:84%
just as you said, we
come into our body

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.980 align:middle line:84%
when we're a few years after the
body's been actually created.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.052 align:middle line:84%
I came in when I was about,
well, maybe 12, actually.

00:03:30.052 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, that's a
little older, isn't it?

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: Yeah.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: I came in at 12.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed a distinct
change at that age.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.485 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly became
much more powerful.

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel timid anymore.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:84%
I took on my father, who
was a very powerful man.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.919 align:middle line:84%
And I felt none
of this is right.

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing in this family?

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:90%
What's really going on?

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.695 align:middle line:84%
I was really searching
for the answer.

00:03:51.695 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And so Frank Alper talked to
me, or talked to all of us

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.800 align:middle line:84%
in this workshop,
about walk-ins,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:84%
how we choose to
come into a body

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:84%
to bring a much more conscious
or powerful soul in to bring

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.450 align:middle line:84%
transformational
energy, to bring

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle line:84%
high consciousness through
an existing personality which

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:84%
stays the same when we have a
change of soul and walk-ins.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.780 align:middle line:84%
So my emotional, mental, and
spiritual bodies changed.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.579 align:middle line:84%
But the personality
stayed the same.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.600 align:middle line:90%
So we had a big clash.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.037 align:middle line:84%
It was like I was in a
very dysfunctional body.

00:04:24.037 --> 00:04:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And there was this very
high-frequency being

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.970 align:middle line:84%
trying to speak the
truth through this body.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so we're going to
talk about a lot of the common

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:84%
denominators between people
with this experience.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.970 align:middle line:84%
But in the case of
your family, what

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.380 align:middle line:90%
was the experience like for you?

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.620 align:middle line:90%
For them, too.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:90%
Both.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.198 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Well, they were
mystified why had this

00:04:47.198 --> 00:04:52.045 align:middle line:84%
previously shy, timid child
suddenly get very strong,

00:04:52.045 --> 00:04:55.372 align:middle line:84%
get very mouthy, and
want to do his own thing.

00:04:55.372 --> 00:04:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
you were what, 12?

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:84%
They thought
hormones, pubescence--

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Yeah, well that's
what they thought probably.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.837 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:00.837 --> 00:05:02.461 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: But they
couldn't make me out.

00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:03.880 align:middle line:84%
They were a bit
shocked, actually,

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.770 align:middle line:90%
of what was actually going on.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When you said you
were telling the truth a lot--

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.180 align:middle line:84%
of course, on this planet, a
lot of people don't necessarily

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.610 align:middle line:84%
want to hear the truth
per se, unless, of course,

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.100 align:middle line:84%
it's a flattering
portrait of something.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So what kind of truths
were you telling

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.490 align:middle line:84%
in your family that
could've been upsetting,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.485 align:middle line:90%
for example, and friends?

00:05:26.485 --> 00:05:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Well, it was more--
at school and with friends--

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.610 align:middle line:84%
I would just call things,
just name things for what they

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:90%
really were.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.556 align:middle line:84%
And I would look at people
doing things, say with money.

00:05:36.556 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
They were trying, students
trying to make sure they

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.940 align:middle line:84%
got a good student loan
not telling the truth

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.210 align:middle line:90%
about their real status.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And I would tell the
truth and get less money.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, well,
that's not fair.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.630 align:middle line:84%
I told the truth,
that should be OK.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.456 align:middle line:84%
And none of them told the truth,
and they got a better pursory.

00:05:51.456 --> 00:05:53.955 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You hadn't learned
the guile of planet Earth yet,

00:05:53.955 --> 00:05:54.455 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:05:54.455 --> 00:05:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: No, I was really naive.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Walk-ins can be very
naive, because we

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.490 align:middle line:84%
come from at least the
fifth dimension or higher,

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.330 align:middle line:84%
where the unity consciousness
is, and there's only truth.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.690 align:middle line:90%
There are no lies.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.457 align:middle line:90%
There's no polarity.

00:06:06.457 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:90%
There's no illusion.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.320 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, this
is just the way it is.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.850 align:middle line:84%
So I thought this is how
it should be on Earth.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.840 align:middle line:84%
But I was shocked,
because it wasn't.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, no.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, now you were 12 years old.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.841 align:middle line:84%
When this happens with most
people, they're quite a bit

00:06:21.841 --> 00:06:22.340 align:middle line:90%
younger.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about the
normal age range this happens

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.766 align:middle line:90%
and why that is?

00:06:27.766 --> 00:06:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: The reason
it happens is

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.630 align:middle line:84%
because if the walk-in's
soul came in at the time

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.010 align:middle line:84%
of conception, the
frequency difference between

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.139 align:middle line:84%
the walk-in's soul and their
mother would be too great.

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And she'd end up
having a miscarriage

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.750 align:middle line:84%
because she couldn't
carry that soul.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is that what
happens with women?

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Is it-- I wouldn't
say common-- but does

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
that happen, that a
soul tries to come in,

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and the frequencies
are such a mismatch

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.814 align:middle line:84%
with the little vehicle in
development that it miscarries?

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: That could
be one reason.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.180 align:middle line:90%
But usually it's more--

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, I'm not
saying on average by any means,

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.114 align:middle line:84%
but it occurred to me that may
be why some of these occur.

00:07:04.114 --> 00:07:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: I think maybe
some of the time.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.880 align:middle line:84%
But usually it's
more the soul wants

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.999 align:middle line:84%
to have embodiment for part
of the time in the fetus,

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:12.790 align:middle line:84%
but then it just says,
OK, I've had enough.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:13.510 align:middle line:90%
This is plenty.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.804 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of here.

00:07:14.804 --> 00:07:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: And so, you--

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This is hard.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: So this is
why this happens.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, they just may have
wanted to get used to it.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Or the mother and father may
have had a contract to actually

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.070 align:middle line:84%
experience life and
death, to go through grief

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.430 align:middle line:90%
of the loss of a child.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.970 align:middle line:84%
There can be all sorts
of agreements worked out

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.865 align:middle line:84%
between the souls
prior to incarnation.

00:07:31.865 --> 00:07:33.990 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole range
of things that can happen.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, so going back to
the walk-in scenario,

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:84%
so a high frequency
entity-- it's

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.110 align:middle line:84%
too difficult to get through
the birth process, right?

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.070 align:middle line:90%
So let's go from there.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.653 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: Yeah.

00:07:45.653 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:84%
So what happens there
is that the walk-in soul

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and the first soul will pick
a time, a very specific time

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and location, for the
walk-in to actually occur.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Because the firs
soul has created

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.223 align:middle line:84%
the body, the
personality, and it's

00:07:59.223 --> 00:08:02.210 align:middle line:84%
got a very specific astrological
configuration, which

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.390 align:middle line:84%
is why kids are often early or
late, because they are trying

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.830 align:middle line:84%
to adjust to make sure they
get the right astrology.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And so the walk-in
soul will pick

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.140 align:middle line:84%
a time which will produce
a new astrological chart,

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.125 align:middle line:90%
the walk-in chart.

00:08:14.125 --> 00:08:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And so it wants a very specific
pattern to occur there,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.620 align:middle line:84%
that's why the time
is prearranged.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And so when they do the
exchange, what actually happens

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.076 align:middle line:84%
is that the first
soul withdrawals all

00:08:25.076 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:84%
its energy from the
cellular structure,

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:84%
just like when we
die, physically die.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.570 align:middle line:84%
It pulls all the energy from
the cells to the pranic tube.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.787 align:middle line:84%
And then it leaves in about
a millionth of a second.

00:08:33.787 --> 00:08:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In a
millionth of a second?

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.299 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: About a
millionth of a second.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.049 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
that it goes like this.

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And then the second soul
will come like this.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.433 align:middle line:90%
And they pause about here.

00:08:40.433 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it happen once.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.382 align:middle line:84%
They pause, they just must
communicate very briefly.

00:08:44.382 --> 00:08:45.465 align:middle line:90%
And then they go, "shoop."

00:08:45.465 --> 00:08:48.264 align:middle line:84%
The other one comes in and
spreads its energy back

00:08:48.264 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:90%
into the cellular structure.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.890 align:middle line:84%
But basically it's
a brand new being.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.765 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's within
a breath it's done.

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:54.445 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Literally
a blink of an eye.

00:08:54.445 --> 00:08:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's done.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about you at 12
years old and where you were

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:06.770 align:middle line:84%
and how this happened, and
what the notion of memory

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.140 align:middle line:90%
for yourself.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
talk in a little bit.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.372 align:middle line:84%
I talked to Drunvalo about
this recently on camera.

00:09:12.372 --> 00:09:14.330 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to insert
that in a little later

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.690 align:middle line:84%
about his experience of how that
happened on a cellular memory.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.390 align:middle line:90%
But how was your transition?

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.300 align:middle line:90%
How did this occur?

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.526 align:middle line:84%
And where, and why did you
choose that place and time?

00:09:24.526 --> 00:09:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: There's two
types of walk-ins.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.900 align:middle line:84%
You can have either a conscious
one or an unconscious one.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.120 align:middle line:90%
Mine was relatively unconscious.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.347 align:middle line:84%
Usually the first soul initiates
a shock, or an illness,

00:09:35.347 --> 00:09:37.430 align:middle line:84%
something to disrupt all
the energy systems that--

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:38.055 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:09:38.055 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So what did your previous-- the
soul in this body previously--

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.315 align:middle line:84%
what did it manifest in
order to make this happen?

00:09:43.315 --> 00:09:44.565 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: I'm not sure exactly.

00:09:44.565 --> 00:09:47.370 align:middle line:84%
All I knew is that I
woke up one day feeling,

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.530 align:middle line:90%
I haven't been here before.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what's going
on, I looked at the world

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:52.930 align:middle line:90%
completely differently.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: Things were more--

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.625 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So you had no memory.

00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:56.340 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: I had no memory.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.548 align:middle line:90%
Things were more luminescent.

00:09:57.548 --> 00:09:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm just like, who
are these people?

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.940 align:middle line:84%
It was literally like
waking up out of a dream.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was in this body trying
to work it out, what's going on.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't feel a
connection to my family.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: At all.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: From what
I can remember,

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:12.980 align:middle line:90%
not much of a connection.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.271 align:middle line:84%
Who are these people going
through the motions of life?

00:10:15.271 --> 00:10:16.860 align:middle line:90%
What's this house?

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.450 align:middle line:90%
It was really strange.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.280 align:middle line:90%
It's like having amnesia.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.984 align:middle line:90%
So I actually had lost memory.

00:10:22.984 --> 00:10:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I'd lost the
emotional connection,

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:84%
because the emotional
body changes.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So all the emotional
cords are gone.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.430 align:middle line:84%
But I'd also lost
a bit of memory.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.495 align:middle line:90%
So I have blanks on childhood.

00:10:32.495 --> 00:10:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Because the mental
body which contains

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.330 align:middle line:90%
the memory had left as well.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.580 align:middle line:84%
We have residual
memory in our cells

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.930 align:middle line:90%
which could come out eventually.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.679 align:middle line:84%
But at that stage, it
was like literally I

00:10:41.679 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:84%
had been transplanted
into someone else's life

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.770 align:middle line:84%
with no memory of
how I got there.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How weird can that
be when you don't have memory?

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.744 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like some people have
more memory from the beginning,

00:10:52.744 --> 00:10:54.535 align:middle line:84%
others have less memory
from the beginning.

00:10:54.535 --> 00:10:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: It varies.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:55.699 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It varies.

00:10:55.699 --> 00:10:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: It varies.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So were you at home?

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, you don't know.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, the day you remember
feeling different,

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.430 align:middle line:84%
was everything kind of
unrecognizable to you?

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:10.999 align:middle line:84%
Or was there some body memory of
some of your stuff and maybe--

00:11:10.999 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: The house sort
of looked familiar.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.170 align:middle line:84%
But it was almost like
a soft-focus movie.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:17.687 align:middle line:90%
Again, I was like, ooh.

00:11:17.687 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:90%
It sort of looks OK.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.837 align:middle line:90%
But it's not quite OK.

00:11:20.837 --> 00:11:21.920 align:middle line:90%
I guess that's how it was.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I remember a very specific
moment in the lounge at home,

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.097 align:middle line:84%
looking around, trying to work
it out, what is going on here?

00:11:30.097 --> 00:11:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Where were you?

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.264 align:middle line:90%
Where did this take place?

00:11:32.264 --> 00:11:33.888 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: That was at
my parents' house.

00:11:33.888 --> 00:11:34.530 align:middle line:90%
I was only 12.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Were you in
England at the time?

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: Well, no.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:90%
This was in New Zealand.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This
was in New Zealand.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Yes, this
was in New Zealand.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.273 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK., All right.

00:11:41.273 --> 00:11:43.999 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: And then from there
on, I tried to work out-- well,

00:11:43.999 --> 00:11:45.040 align:middle line:90%
what's actually happened?

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I started exploring,
trying to work it out.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.373 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't as
conscious as I am now.

00:11:48.373 --> 00:11:51.000 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that
something wasn't right.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So as you
started expressing yourself,

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:84%
and your family had
to get used to you,

00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:00.330 align:middle line:84%
what were the soul expressions
that were occurring?

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:01.827 align:middle line:90%
You obviously came for purpose.

00:12:01.827 --> 00:12:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing
your life's work now,

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:05.650 align:middle line:84%
which is really beautiful
work, and your work,

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.530 align:middle line:90%
also, in soul contracts.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And so how did this
start showing itself

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.670 align:middle line:84%
in terms of
personality difference

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.350 align:middle line:84%
if you were to ask
your family about it?

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Well, I think I
became probably more driven.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.220 align:middle line:84%
I was searching for the
real meaning of my life.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.980 align:middle line:84%
All these kids at
school were going

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.524 align:middle line:84%
to go and be policeman or
engineers or architects,

00:12:25.524 --> 00:12:27.190 align:middle line:84%
whatever the stuff
they do at school is.

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.357 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well I'm not
going to do any of that.

00:12:29.357 --> 00:12:30.773 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I have
to do something.

00:12:30.773 --> 00:12:32.040 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm in a body.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.764 align:middle line:84%
So I sort of settled
for something,

00:12:33.764 --> 00:12:34.930 align:middle line:90%
I settled to be an engineer.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.470 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that
wasn't really it.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:84%
But I hadn't actually found
what, deep in my soul,

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.610 align:middle line:84%
was the real meaning
for being here.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I knew I was unconsciously
searching for that.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of set off to
find out, well, what is it?

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.310 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be a real
reason for being here.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And no one could
give me the answer.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.970 align:middle line:90%
It was silence.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And that was like,
what do I do with this?

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is a
very common experience.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
questionnaire, when

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.459 align:middle line:84%
people start feeling like
something's not right--

00:13:07.459 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:84%
why am I here, I don't belong
to these people, all the things

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.272 align:middle line:84%
you said-- if
they're lucky, they

00:13:12.272 --> 00:13:14.480 align:middle line:84%
will come in contact with
someone that will turn them

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:84%
onto your site and understand
there are many others like you.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not common, but there
are others out there.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And this feeling
of not belonging

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.594 align:middle line:84%
is probably number
one, would you say?

00:13:24.594 --> 00:13:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Yes, it's because
there's a vast difference

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.320 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness and frequency
in between a walk-in soul

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:84%
and the majority of people
on Earth, even lightworkers,

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.880 align:middle line:90%
even other service souls.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they're
any better or worse,

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.650 align:middle line:84%
it's just that a
walk-in soul volunteers

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.820 align:middle line:84%
to come to Earth to bring a
very specific stream of higher

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:44.580 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.645 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of the
ascension process on Earth.

00:13:46.645 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:84%
We each have very
specific roles.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.520 align:middle line:90%
We don't come here by accident.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:90%
We get chosen.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.956 align:middle line:84%
We volunteer, but we get chosen
for the gift we will bring.

00:13:55.956 --> 00:13:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And because the walk-in
soul has an enormous amount

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.180 align:middle line:84%
of experience and soul power,
we are programmed at soul level;

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.360 align:middle line:90%
we will do it no matter what.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.540 align:middle line:84%
No matter how dense the cellular
memory from the first soul

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.990 align:middle line:84%
is, the issues we
have to work through.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Because we need to learn
how to become human.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't know what
it's like to be human.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.320 align:middle line:84%
We can't relate
our gift to people.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.070 align:middle line:84%
It'll just be going over
their head, it'll be nonsense.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So we have to have the
human experience, as well.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.600 align:middle line:90%
And that's the dichotomy.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.870 align:middle line:84%
It's like we've got a lot of
dysfunction in the body, which

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.960 align:middle line:84%
we all have, just the nature
of being in a body and separate

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.540 align:middle line:90%
from God.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And then we've got this
higher-frequency truth wanting

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:84%
to come through us in
a very specific way.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And this frequency is
coming into the body.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And what it's doing
is it's releasing

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.179 align:middle line:84%
all this dysfunctional
programming

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:41.220 align:middle line:90%
as it's trying to embody.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.240 align:middle line:84%
But it must do that so the
body rises in frequency,

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.915 align:middle line:84%
to allow the higher
consciousness

00:14:45.915 --> 00:14:48.040 align:middle line:84%
part of the walk-in to
embody more parts of itself.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.581 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't
all come in at once.

00:14:49.581 --> 00:14:52.070 align:middle line:84%
We come in in layers
and different components

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.032 align:middle line:84%
if the frequency of
the body can handle it.

00:14:54.032 --> 00:14:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I see.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Cause if we all
came in at one go, we'd pop.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:57.830 align:middle line:90%
Our body couldn't handle it.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You'd short-circuit
the body, the brain,

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.410 align:middle line:90%
the neurology--

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:01.306 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: The body
could not handle it.

00:15:01.306 --> 00:15:02.306 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --everything.

00:15:02.306 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Oh, so parts of you keep
coming in over time.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.579 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Yeah,
new parts come in.

00:15:08.579 --> 00:15:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
that I couldn't

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.150 align:middle line:90%
find the answer of why I'm here.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Because it wasn't going to
be revealed to me till I

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.370 align:middle line:84%
was ready-- I could
emotionally cope,

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.640 align:middle line:84%
and I was spiritually evolved
enough at a personally level

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:84%
to better handle the answer
that was going to come.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.005 align:middle line:84%
So we have to get clear
enough emotionally,

00:15:26.005 --> 00:15:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and embody enough
of who we are, then

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.710 align:middle line:84%
spirit starts to reveal,
now, here's the real purpose.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And when they reveal
that, it's like,

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.420 align:middle line:90%
yeah, I can cope with that.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.910 align:middle line:90%
I can cope with that.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you told me I'd be
doing this, say 20 years ago,

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:38.910 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't have coped with that.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:39.852 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:15:39.852 --> 00:15:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: But I can now.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.740 align:middle line:84%
It's like, bring
it on, let's go.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.488 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: You see.

00:15:43.488 --> 00:15:47.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's an experiment
in consciousness.

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Because the soul doesn't know
how me, at personality level,

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.720 align:middle line:84%
is going to relate to a
lot of what's going on.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.680 align:middle line:84%
So it has to try a few
things on to awaken,

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.480 align:middle line:84%
embody consciousness,
and see what happens.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.570 align:middle line:90%
And it adjusts.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a
foregone conclusion

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:02.866 align:middle line:84%
how the life's
going to turn out.

00:16:02.866 --> 00:16:04.948 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I was
going to ask you that next.

00:16:04.948 --> 00:16:06.940 align:middle line:84%
What happens when this
agreement has been made,

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:84%
a soul successfully
exchanges with the other,

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:84%
and it takes on
this walk-in status,

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and then the one who has
walked in says, "It's too much.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:18.810 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this."

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Does that happen fairly often,
where then the soul will leave,

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.884 align:middle line:84%
and the body goes
ahead and dies?

00:16:25.884 --> 00:16:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: Occasionally.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it with some of
the clients I've worked with.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Because we work with a
lot of walk-in souls.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.320 align:middle line:84%
We seem to be walk-in
central in England.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes,
walk-in central, yes.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Yeah, they
find us somehow.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Because I've tried
everything else.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And we're like the port of
last resort, please help.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.864 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that's
what's going on.

00:16:43.864 --> 00:16:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally they
come into a body which

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.580 align:middle line:84%
is too dysfunctional,
and the walk-in

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:51.140 align:middle line:84%
can't wake the
personality up enough.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the
body will get ill.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:54.820 align:middle line:90%
And it will die.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.240 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it happen a few times.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the walk-in soul
can misjudge the level

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.597 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and
the density of the--

00:17:02.597 --> 00:17:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Density, yeah--

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: -cell memory.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --the potential of
the cells to take that-- yeah.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: And how
someone can change.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the human ego is
very attached to suffering

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.609 align:middle line:84%
and staying in its
same old place.

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:14.220 align:middle line:84%
It wants to hang
on to the old way

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:84%
rather than open
to consciousness.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.440 align:middle line:90%
So it happens occasionally.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.940 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time,
most walk-in souls

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.109 align:middle line:90%
find a way to integrate.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.470 align:middle line:90%
It can be rough at times.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Some are relatively smooth,
because we have different soul

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.562 align:middle line:90%
types.

00:17:30.562 --> 00:17:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you have the
same soul type coming

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.600 align:middle line:84%
in the bodies as a predecessor,
it's so much easier.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.670 align:middle line:90%
Like, we have angelics.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:42.260 align:middle line:84%
You have extraterrestrials,
and you have ascended masters.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And a smattering
of elohim souls,

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.970 align:middle line:84%
very high-frequency
beings who come in.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:49.774 align:middle line:84%
So if you have, for
example, say an angelic soul

00:17:49.774 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:84%
in the body initially--
it's very gentle

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and unconditionally
loving-- then

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.340 align:middle line:84%
you bring an
extraterrestrial soul--

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.710 align:middle line:84%
who is going to have a much
more harder, more focused

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:84%
energy, because that's where a
lot of extraterrestrial souls

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.019 align:middle line:84%
come from-- the body's going
to go, what's going on here?

00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, that
makes sense, because--

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Like a
different language, see?

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and adaptations
would have to be made within

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.540 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence of the
souls-- I mean of the cells

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.370 align:middle line:84%
of the body-- to
accommodate that soul.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:13.490 align:middle line:90%
That makes perfect sense.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:84%
ET energy is not at all the
same as an angelic guide,

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:20.090 align:middle line:90%
or source type of energy.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's not as though
one is over the other.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.525 align:middle line:84%
They're just such a
different energy--

00:18:25.525 --> 00:18:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: It's a
different language.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --for a
different person Yeah,

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and they have different
purposes for coming here, right?

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: Oh, yeah.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I think it's
important to acknowledge that

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:42.550 align:middle line:84%
each one of us is a splendid
being at the core of all

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:45.510 align:middle line:84%
of this and trying
to just work it out.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And the notion that you
come in a little bit

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.840 align:middle line:84%
later to be able to get on with
this process without having

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.746 align:middle line:84%
to go through the first 12
years, or the first 20 years,

00:18:53.746 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:84%
or in Drunvalo's
case, I think it

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.970 align:middle line:84%
was almost 30
years or something.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:90%
I can understand that.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.070 align:middle line:84%
If a soul has to make a contract
to get a certain thing done

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.920 align:middle line:84%
at a time when the planet is
ready for that information,

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.430 align:middle line:90%
say, like what you're doing.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Yeah, usually it's
pre-incarnationally organized,

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.890 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes they're
done on the fly.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes someone will
say, I'm sort of done.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And then a walk-in
sou-- they may even

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.760 align:middle line:84%
have a discussion
at the soul level.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.551 align:middle line:84%
The will say, OK, well,
we can do a change.

00:19:22.551 --> 00:19:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And this one will
say, yep, no problem.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And especially nowadays,
because we've been through 2012,

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.945 align:middle line:84%
and the process of ascension
is going very rapidly,

00:19:31.945 --> 00:19:33.820 align:middle line:84%
no one actually knows
what's going to happen.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.587 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of odd specialists
are going to turn up.

00:19:36.587 --> 00:19:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A lot of specialists?

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Specialists, in
terms of their consciousness--

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.799 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: --what the gifts
they'll bring in-- and they may

00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:44.340 align:middle line:84%
come in literally
at the last minute.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.714 align:middle line:84%
OK, we need this now, we need
this now, we need this now.

00:19:46.714 --> 00:19:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And they'll arrive to
actually help in the process.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.904 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the phenomena
of walk-ins is increasing?

00:19:53.904 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: It's hard to
say from my perspective,

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.486 align:middle line:84%
because we see a
disproportionate number

00:19:57.486 --> 00:20:00.384 align:middle line:84%
of people like this,
simply because of--

00:20:00.384 --> 00:20:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because they're
finding their way to you.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Because they're
finding us, you see.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:04.840 align:middle line:84%
So we do a lot of
work with that.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if the
number's increasing,

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:07.830 align:middle line:90%
but I'd say it's not decreasing.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So tell us about
instances, for example--

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.120 align:middle line:84%
because you have, sometimes,
this lack of memory,

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.820 align:middle line:84%
or amnesia of sorts, but the
whole personality has changed--

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.080 align:middle line:84%
with some of the people
that you have dealt with--

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.440 align:middle line:84%
can you give us an example
of someone else-- no names,

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:27.160 align:middle line:84%
of course-- where their entire
personality began changing,

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and what it did to a family,
or within their relationships.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:34.784 align:middle line:84%
It can be anyone that comes
to your mind, actually.

00:20:34.784 --> 00:20:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Yeah, sometimes
people can do this process--

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.880 align:middle line:84%
because I've helped people
do this consciously,

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.800 align:middle line:84%
this is where I've observed the
change of souls, literally--

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:49.087 align:middle line:84%
and they can come in as one
person, in the treatment room.

00:20:49.087 --> 00:20:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And they end up going
out as another person.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And they know
something's happened.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:53.384 align:middle line:84%
And I will explain
to them-- this

00:20:53.384 --> 00:20:56.449 align:middle line:84%
is one person I explained--
this is about to happen.

00:20:56.449 --> 00:20:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very specific
time it had to happen.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So a spirit told me, you must
have her in a certain state,

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.290 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the energy work
we were doing, by this time,

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:05.932 align:middle line:84%
because we're going
to have a walk-in.

00:21:05.932 --> 00:21:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is where
the astrology has to happen,

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:08.570 align:middle line:90%
in that second--

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Yeah, they literally
talk to my ear, see.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.990 align:middle line:84%
They're like, 10:59
AM and 30 seconds

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.020 align:middle line:90%
this is going to happen.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.380 align:middle line:90%
And it did.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:15.470 align:middle line:90%
And they said in my ear.

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: How bizarre is that?

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.495 align:middle line:90%
So you've assisted--

00:21:18.495 --> 00:21:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: Assisted and--

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And witnessed, too--

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:20.926 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: witnessed it.

00:21:20.926 --> 00:21:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --the change.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And so tell us what happened
with the personality

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:90%
before and after.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Well, she went home
to her family as a different

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:31.580 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And then she looked in
the wardrobe, thinking,

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.230 align:middle line:84%
all these flower, hippy-like
clothes, blah, yuck.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Don't like any of these.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.940 align:middle line:90%
She chucked them all out.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.090 align:middle line:84%
She stopped eating what
the previous soul did.

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:46.114 align:middle line:84%
She quit the job of
the previous soul.

00:21:46.114 --> 00:21:47.490 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And she basically built
an entirely new life

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.730 align:middle line:84%
and was very lost, initially,
very emotionally dysfunctional

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:58.180 align:middle line:84%
because the high
frequency coming in

00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.680 align:middle line:84%
was pushing out
all the dysfunction

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:84%
from the first soul, which is
contained in the soul contract.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And so she spent the
first two or three years

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:84%
just cleaning the body out
and blowing chakras and trying

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.260 align:middle line:84%
to rebuild her energy system,
so that the high frequency

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.200 align:middle line:90%
part could arrive.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.089 align:middle line:84%
And so all her friends
just were gone.

00:22:16.089 --> 00:22:17.630 align:middle line:84%
She looked at these
people thinking--

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:19.463 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No friends,
lost all her friends.

00:22:19.463 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: It's like,
I don't know you.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you're relating
to me the way I used to be.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:27.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's not me.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.200 align:middle line:84%
So they were
projecting on her what

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.967 align:middle line:84%
we call telepathic imaging
of how she should be.

00:22:31.967 --> 00:22:33.550 align:middle line:84%
It was like an
energetic cage, and she

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.290 align:middle line:84%
was feeling really constricted
and got ill around them.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So she said, I can't
be with these people.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Because they unconsciously
think I'm her, but I'm me.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So she had to rebuild
all her friendships.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.170 align:middle line:84%
She completely rebuilt
the relationship

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.090 align:middle line:90%
with her biological parents.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.170 align:middle line:90%
It took a long time.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.420 align:middle line:84%
But she knew she had to do
that as part of integration

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.745 align:middle line:84%
to actually relate
to human beings--

00:22:53.745 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:54.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: --that have a family.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:59.070 align:middle line:10%
So basically it created a
completely different life

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.400 align:middle line:10%
and was quite unstable for
a long time, energetically,

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.550 align:middle line:10%
because of all the higher
frequencies coming in

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.110 align:middle line:10%
and what was in the
body, separation-wise.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.040 align:middle line:84%
But eventually it
started to integrate.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.554 align:middle line:90%
Things started to align.

00:23:10.554 --> 00:23:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And her mission
started to happen.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:15.530 align:middle line:84%
But it was quite tough,
because she was like 30,

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:17.294 align:middle line:84%
and because we get a
lot more solidified

00:23:17.294 --> 00:23:19.460 align:middle line:84%
with our emotional programming
by the time we're 30.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.160 align:middle line:84%
When we're a child, which is
like I was, when it happens,

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.120 align:middle line:90%
it's much easier.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.224 align:middle line:84%
Children are much more
fluid, emotionally.

00:23:25.224 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:90%
They are much more flexible.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot
easier to integrate.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's about the same
age it happened to Drunvalo.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And what we'll do is we'll take
the next several minutes-- six,

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:84%
seven minutes,
something like that--

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and take a look at a
video of his experience.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And just before-- it was
a longer conversation

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.120 align:middle line:84%
I had with him,
about a half an hour.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And we've just taken
a couple of excerpts.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And he was able
to, after a period

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.070 align:middle line:84%
of time, regain his
memory completely

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:90%
of the whole process.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And souls travel from all
parts throughout the cosmos

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.839 align:middle line:84%
to go through this step-down
process, right, in density?

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:01.380 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: Yes.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.505 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is a
subject I'm familiar with.

00:24:03.505 --> 00:24:04.840 align:middle line:90%
And he explained it.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And from him-- his soul-- as
far back as that memory goes,

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:12.400 align:middle line:84%
as a non-physical being
from a higher dimension--

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.950 align:middle line:84%
went through the Crab
Nebula beyond Orion

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:19.030 align:middle line:84%
and started a step-down
process through,

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:22.210 align:middle line:84%
I believe, the Pleiades,
and then into Sirius,

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.690 align:middle line:84%
and then from Sirius to
Venus, and step down,

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:84%
step down, step down,
into more and more density

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:31.710 align:middle line:84%
until the process was finished
enough so that he could

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.270 align:middle line:84%
come into a
physical, Earth body.

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:37.130 align:middle line:84%
We're going to pick his story
up where he speaks about,

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:41.220 align:middle line:84%
I believe, the Sirian portion
of it, of leaving Sirius,

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:90%
now on his journey toward Earth.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:43.820 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: OK.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:50.740 align:middle line:10%
>> DRUNVALO: I remember
leaving the surface of Sirius B

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:55.140 align:middle line:10%
and making a huge, huge
arc, coming around to come

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:59.060 align:middle line:10%
into Sirius A. And
we were moving--

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.580 align:middle line:10%
not at the speed of light,
but sub-speed of light,

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:05.270 align:middle line:10%
about 9/10 the speed of
light-- and we went straight

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:10.370 align:middle line:10%
into the sun, Sirius A. And
about 90 seconds later we came

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:15.450 align:middle line:10%
out in our sun, here,
in our solar system.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Our sun and their sun
are interconnected.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And we move in a double-helical
pattern around the galaxy.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.940 align:middle line:90%
And that's why this was so easy.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I
had to go to Venus

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.030 align:middle line:84%
to get permission to come
into Earth, because Venus

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.880 align:middle line:84%
is the highest level
of consciousness

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.610 align:middle line:90%
in this solar system.

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:38.640 align:middle line:90%
And I did that.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I came
into Earth, into 1840,

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.790 align:middle line:84%
into the fourth
dimension of the Earth.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And they released me into the
atmosphere, and I went in.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And I thought all of
the ascended masters

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.110 align:middle line:90%
were going to be there.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:53.210 align:middle line:90%
There was nobody there.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And I went up in the
fifth, nobody there.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.125 align:middle line:84%
And I went into the sixth,
and there they all were.

00:25:57.125 --> 00:25:59.160 align:middle line:90%
And I spent 10 years with them.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.440 align:middle line:84%
But that's 10 years
fourth-dimensional,

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.900 align:middle line:90%
10 years of Earth time.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably,
maybe 100 years.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.160 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know what it is.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a long time.

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And then in 1850, I was born
normally, not as a walk-in.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:20.752 align:middle line:84%
So each time along
here I was walking in.

00:26:20.752 --> 00:26:21.710 align:middle line:90%
But this time I didn't.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:25.560 align:middle line:84%
I came in a normal way and
was born to the Taos Pueblo.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's another whole story.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Eventually I died
in there in 1890.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And the moment I did,
I made so many mistakes

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:90%
in this first life.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.400 align:middle line:84%
It was just like I didn't
know what I was doing.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept doing
everything wrong.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And I went back with
the ascended masters.

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And I spent from 1890 to 1972
with them, trying to (LAUGHING)

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.560 align:middle line:84%
understand what
this is all about.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And I finally felt
like I was ready.

00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And then on April 10, 1972,
I walked into this body.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:08.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, I knew as a
spirit that we first

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:10.710 align:middle line:84%
had to select the
body on the Earth.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:14.250 align:middle line:84%
It isn't like selecting one
out of an inventory that

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:90%
knew things.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.310 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't do that,
because this planet

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.930 align:middle line:90%
didn't know about this.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.510 align:middle line:90%
And so I had to select a body.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:24.560 align:middle line:84%
That was chosen because
of its education

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.140 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of other factors.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Its emotional stability,
a lot of things.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, I
began to speak with him

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:36.960 align:middle line:84%
about nine years
before I came in.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.130 align:middle line:84%
I knew to the second
when he was going to die.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:42.910 align:middle line:84%
I had permission to
enter into this body,

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:46.780 align:middle line:90%
but I was also giving to him.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.890 align:middle line:84%
We began to train him on higher
levels of consciousness, which

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I would
be able to use later.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:28:00.460 align:middle line:84%
But we gave him a huge gift
of allowing him to, when

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:04.250 align:middle line:84%
he did die, to go to a much
higher level of evolution

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:05.730 align:middle line:90%
than what he was on.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And that was like a gift
for him giving us his body.

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And well, I knew exactly
when it was going to happen.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And so when it did happen
on April 10 of 1972,

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:32.870 align:middle line:84%
the person that he was
working with was an alchemist

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:35.940 align:middle line:84%
and did something that
he thought was right.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.210 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps it wasn't,
because he ended up

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:39.260 align:middle line:90%
killing this person.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.210 align:middle line:90%
He didn't mean to, but he did.

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And I still remember
when he breathed out--

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and actually, as he started
to, the world began to spin.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:51.790 align:middle line:90%
I still have that memory.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing started
spinning faster and faster

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:58.574 align:middle line:84%
and faster, until
it was just a whirl.

00:28:58.574 --> 00:29:00.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to explain it.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.110 align:middle line:90%
It was just light.

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.960 align:middle line:90%
And then he died.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.750 align:middle line:84%
When he did, I gave
it just a moment.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I breathed in as
he left that continuum.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And I began to breathe
through his body.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And then got to my house
and just dropped me off

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:18.990 align:middle line:90%
and drove away.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So I go into my house to a
family I'd never seen before.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:26.990 align:middle line:84%
But another thing happens
when you're walking in,

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:31.583 align:middle line:84%
and you have to understand,
is that the energies

00:29:31.583 --> 00:29:35.080 align:middle line:84%
of the memories
of the body, which

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:39.130 align:middle line:84%
are in the cellular memory,
begins to take over.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And your old memories begin to
fade, of where you came from

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.970 align:middle line:90%
and what it was all about.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I had
driven back there,

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:49.980 align:middle line:84%
I was the person I was
before-- I mean the person that

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.500 align:middle line:84%
was in this body before--
I had his memories.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew I was coming
back to my wife and my child.

00:29:56.430 --> 00:30:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And I walked in, and it was
just like I was just returning.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And this went on for-- the
angels that have been with me

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:13.720 align:middle line:84%
all this time, they're
guiding me carefully--

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And I went for almost two years
without any memory of who I was

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.010 align:middle line:90%
or why I was in this body.

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:25.610 align:middle line:84%
They wanted me to
balance my karma.

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I spent two
years going around

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.242 align:middle line:84%
to people that I had done things
to and said, oh, I'm so sorry.

00:30:32.242 --> 00:30:33.700 align:middle line:84%
I didn't mean to
hurt you and this.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And when I left
for Canada, I had

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:38.220 align:middle line:90%
spent a lot of credit cards.

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And I went back and
I paid them off.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And I did everything
I could think of

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.400 align:middle line:90%
to make everything feel better.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And when I finally got to the
place where the angel said, "OK

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:51.370 align:middle line:84%
your karma is not perfect, but
it's good enough," they said,

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:55.160 align:middle line:84%
"Now you have to
remember who you are."

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.649 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what
they were talking about.

00:30:57.649 --> 00:30:59.440 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what they
were talking about.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.410 align:middle line:90%


00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So does all that
sound somewhat familiar from

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:08.970 align:middle line:84%
some of the stories of
other people, as well?

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:11.965 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Oh yes,
very, very familiar.

00:31:11.965 --> 00:31:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, people have very
similar sort of stories.

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I have the memory
of coming to Earth.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.940 align:middle line:90%
But it came much later.

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So can you share
what it was like for you

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.494 align:middle line:84%
to remember, and where
you had come from?

00:31:24.494 --> 00:31:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: A lot of my
soul comes from Arcturus.

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mhm.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:28.590 align:middle line:90%
Arcturus, yes.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:30.922 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: And I remember
coming on the grids,

00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:33.860 align:middle line:84%
these geometric
grids, through space.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:37.045 align:middle line:84%
I just remember traveling-- I
think it came out of my cells

00:31:37.045 --> 00:31:40.790 align:middle line:84%
as I got clear enough, of
actually traveling to Earth

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:41.725 align:middle line:90%
and being in orbit.

00:31:41.725 --> 00:31:44.058 align:middle line:84%
I was in some sort of ship
at a higher dimensional level

00:31:44.058 --> 00:31:46.195 align:middle line:84%
observing Earth, a
very strong memory.

00:31:46.195 --> 00:31:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Because whenever I
see a movie like, say,

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.990 align:middle line:84%
"Gravity," I feel
like I've done this.

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:53.150 align:middle line:84%
I've just sat there
and watched Earth.

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:55.770 align:middle line:84%
It's far beyond just the awe
of seeing it on the screen.

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:56.960 align:middle line:90%
It's like it comes back.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.710 align:middle line:84%
I remember sitting--
there was like this frame

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:01.820 align:middle line:84%
on the spaceship--
and I'm observing

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Earth getting ready, sort
of preparing, training,

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.710 align:middle line:90%
and waiting for the right time.

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And I have the memory
of actually incarnating

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.177 align:middle line:84%
at a very specific
time at the changeover.

00:32:13.177 --> 00:32:15.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the memory of
the actual changeover itself,

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:18.830 align:middle line:84%
but I have the memory of going
down the grid into the body,

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:20.160 align:middle line:90%
just before.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.740 align:middle line:90%
I still remember that.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes
blank, just like--

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just
like what he said.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: --what
Drunvalo-- you go blank.

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's like you're struggling
for, I know there's something

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:31.150 align:middle line:84%
there, but it's
gone to darkness.

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Because you go into the
void, or the unconsciousness

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:35.730 align:middle line:90%
of the cellular memory.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I spent 20-odd
years trying to wake up again

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:41.350 align:middle line:90%
from that.

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And funny-- you
mentioned that you remembered

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:46.040 align:middle line:90%
being in the craft and so forth.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.030 align:middle line:84%
That's part of many
things that were cut out

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:50.280 align:middle line:84%
of that little bit of
conversation you heard there.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: It's really clear.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:51.575 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:32:51.575 --> 00:32:53.660 align:middle line:84%
He remembered the
craft, too, before even

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.980 align:middle line:84%
coming into Sirius
B, for example.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:58.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, Arcturus
has a lot of connection

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:07.080 align:middle line:84%
with Earth right now in
terms of also sending

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.965 align:middle line:84%
a lot of non-physicals
and guides here.

00:33:09.965 --> 00:33:12.820 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
guides from Arcturus.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Often times they're perceived as
these very tall, blue energies,

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:23.490 align:middle line:84%
for example, and really
beautiful beings,

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:24.980 align:middle line:90%
beautiful beings.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's a nice place
to come from, I guess,

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:28.185 align:middle line:90%
is what I'm saying.

00:33:28.185 --> 00:33:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Oh yeah, Arcturians
have a very high level

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:31.720 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual technology.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're sort of like
the major caretakers

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.980 align:middle line:84%
of this ascension process
and doing whatever

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.752 align:middle line:84%
it takes to make sure this
happens with grace and ease,

00:33:42.752 --> 00:33:44.710 align:middle line:84%
despite all the things
that go on in the world.

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:47.050 align:middle line:90%
I have a couple of guides.

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:48.930 align:middle line:84%
I just call them
the big blue guys.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:50.450 align:middle line:90%
And they're from Arcturus.

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:52.620 align:middle line:90%
And they're like genies to me.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.060 align:middle line:90%
They're amazing.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Whatever has to be modulated
or done, they just do it.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest problem
is remembering to ask,

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:04.490 align:middle line:84%
because I forget to ask for
assistance most of the time.

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:06.950 align:middle line:84%
But when I do, I'm shocked
at what they're able

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:10.520 align:middle line:84%
to, from non-physical
realms, work so easily

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:14.080 align:middle line:84%
into this dimension, even
of a physical nature.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.469 align:middle line:90%
They're really wonderful.

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of respect
for your people. [LAUGHS]

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.219 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's get down to
some of the physicality of it

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:23.929 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
things that you might

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:26.570 align:middle line:84%
look at if you're
thinking, gosh you know,

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:27.880 align:middle line:90%
I have some of these traits.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.130 align:middle line:84%
One of the things is food
becomes an issue when

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:32.340 align:middle line:84%
you get into your
vehicle, your new vehicle.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, from
what I understand,

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:38.000 align:middle line:84%
people don't know what they
want to fuel themselves with,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.350 align:middle line:90%
what they want to eat.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:40.590 align:middle line:90%
Food becomes an issue.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Yeah, the reason for
that is because we're used

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.620 align:middle line:84%
to, from the higher dimensions,
having higher dimensional life

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:49.139 align:middle line:84%
force, or called higher
light, feeding us.

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:52.409 align:middle line:84%
The Breatharians are on to that
idea, but in the physical body.

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:54.909 align:middle line:84%
But normally we don't have to
eat in the higher dimensions.

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So when we come in a body, we're
looking for higher frequency

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:59.550 align:middle line:90%
energy to keep us going.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:00.950 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes we forget to eat.

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:02.699 align:middle line:84%
And then we realize,
ooh, I've got a body.

00:35:02.699 --> 00:35:03.615 align:middle line:90%
I need to eat.

00:35:03.615 --> 00:35:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And a very typical thing
that happens with walk-ins

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.884 align:middle line:84%
is they're going looking
for dark green stuff.

00:35:07.884 --> 00:35:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, really?

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: They're going around
the supermarket looking

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:11.097 align:middle line:90%
for dark green stuff.

00:35:11.097 --> 00:35:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Why dark green stuff?

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Because they just know
it has the right frequency.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: And the closest thing
they usually find is blue-green

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:16.750 align:middle line:90%
algae.

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:17.984 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, right.

00:35:17.984 --> 00:35:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: And once they find
that, it's a lot easier.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.733 align:middle line:90%
But actually--

00:35:20.733 --> 00:35:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's like,
yum, food, algae.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.401 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Yeah, well that's
because it's very high

00:35:24.401 --> 00:35:25.480 align:middle line:90%
frequency usually.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.740 align:middle line:84%
But they're trying lots
of different things.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And they're finding
out it doesn't work.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.401 align:middle line:84%
Because they can't remember
what it is they need.

00:35:30.401 --> 00:35:32.710 align:middle line:84%
They just know this is not
it, and this is not it.

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:34.294 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
searching for it.

00:35:34.294 --> 00:35:35.710 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens
with the food.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.400 align:middle line:90%
So we have to go very organic.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.550 align:middle line:84%
It has to be very
highly conscious,

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.369 align:middle line:84%
be cooked and
prepared, the food.

00:35:43.369 --> 00:35:45.910 align:middle line:84%
You see, they're trying to raise
the frequency of their body.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you put normal food
with pesticides and additives,

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.860 align:middle line:84%
then you're just dropping
the frequency of the body.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.821 align:middle line:84%
And the walk-in-- it's
the last thing it wants.

00:35:51.821 --> 00:35:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, right.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.987 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: You see, so that's
why the food's an issue.

00:35:54.987 --> 00:35:56.986 align:middle line:84%
A lot of walk-ins don't
eat properly for a while

00:35:56.986 --> 00:35:58.610 align:middle line:84%
till they figure
out the food thing.

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:00.901 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: First thing they
taste-- and it's like, ooh,

00:36:00.901 --> 00:36:02.030 align:middle line:90%
yum, cookies.

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Or they'll try lots
of things on, not just food.

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:06.310 align:middle line:84%
They'll try things
on to see, well,

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:07.870 align:middle line:84%
what's it like to
drive this body?

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:08.812 align:middle line:90%
Let's try hamburgers.

00:36:08.812 --> 00:36:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Eh, don't like that.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:10.613 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's try spaghetti.

00:36:10.613 --> 00:36:11.655 align:middle line:90%
Oh that's not too bad.

00:36:11.655 --> 00:36:12.405 align:middle line:90%
I can handle that.

00:36:12.405 --> 00:36:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They
like the spaghetti?

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:14.366 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Then it might
change over time.

00:36:14.366 --> 00:36:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, right.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:15.790 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:16.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: Everything changes.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.903 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's this
confusion around the whole

00:36:18.903 --> 00:36:20.070 align:middle line:90%
scenario of food.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And what about, also-- I
was reading in your book

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:28.110 align:middle line:84%
that schizophrenia, a feeling
of feeling schizophrenic,

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:30.640 align:middle line:84%
like there's more than
one personality in there,

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.032 align:middle line:90%
that that's a real problem.

00:36:32.032 --> 00:36:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Yeah, that comes
because the cellular memory

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.620 align:middle line:90%
of the first soul's still there.

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:38.505 align:middle line:84%
So it's residual
personality memory.

00:36:38.505 --> 00:36:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got
the new soul coming

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:45.099 align:middle line:84%
in putting higher light, higher
frequency, into those cells.

00:36:45.099 --> 00:36:46.890 align:middle line:84%
It's pushing out the
old cellular memories.

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So they get a flash, ooh I feel
really dysfunctional today.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Or this is a familiar
not so good feeling,

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.817 align:middle line:84%
like it was-- I remember what
it was like when I was five.

00:36:56.817 --> 00:36:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Then the new part of them is
going, that's not an issue.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.400 align:middle line:90%
We've just got to be in truth.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.960 align:middle line:84%
We've just got to be focused
on what we're here to do.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:03.960 align:middle line:90%
At the same time--

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you have two
different personalities

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.430 align:middle line:90%
chatting with each other--

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:07.513 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: At the same time.

00:37:07.513 --> 00:37:08.890 align:middle line:90%
And they're not compatible.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:10.460 align:middle line:84%
That's why you get the
schizophrenic feeling.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not saying that everyone
with schizophrenia has that.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.930 align:middle line:84%
But if our walk-in-- often
that happens initially.

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
two consciousnesses

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.440 align:middle line:84%
trying to exist at the same time
and function at the same time,

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.270 align:middle line:84%
probably trying to do different
things at the same time.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's why a lot
of confusion happens.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And another thing
is that often these people,

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:34.720 align:middle line:84%
like yourself, feel very
driven to higher purpose.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Because they came
in for purpose.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.870 align:middle line:84%
They didn't come here
just to live it out.

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:40.330 align:middle line:90%
They came for a purpose.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about that and
maybe a couple of people

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:45.540 align:middle line:84%
that you have
worked with and how

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.420 align:middle line:84%
that affected them
and impacted them

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.769 align:middle line:84%
and what they were
able to manifest?

00:37:49.769 --> 00:37:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Yeah, what happens
with a walk-in is initially

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.984 align:middle line:84%
they're having to deal
with what's in the body.

00:37:54.984 --> 00:37:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And if they've
figured out they're

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.679 align:middle line:84%
a walk-in, that's
the half-way home.

00:38:00.679 --> 00:38:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, it takes a while to accept
that it's actually happened.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like, this is
really science fiction,

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:06.990 align:middle line:84%
but I've tried everything
else and realized

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:09.270 align:middle line:84%
this is the only thing
that actually explains it.

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:10.727 align:middle line:84%
And it's like,
OK, I'm a walk-in.

00:38:10.727 --> 00:38:12.310 align:middle line:84%
I've got to sort out
my emotional side

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.150 align:middle line:90%
of the first side.

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:16.335 align:middle line:84%
I need to come out of
the emotional swamp

00:38:16.335 --> 00:38:18.960 align:middle line:84%
and try and get conscious again,
just like Drunvalo was talking

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.592 align:middle line:84%
about, and become
conscious again.

00:38:21.592 --> 00:38:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Then OK, I'm dealing with
this emotional stuff.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And now I need to get to
the real divine purpose.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Because I know it's in there.

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:30.935 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to find it.

00:38:30.935 --> 00:38:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens then is
that they will search for it.

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:35.268 align:middle line:84%
And they will try out
lots of different things.

00:38:35.268 --> 00:38:37.850 align:middle line:84%
They will explore
and push and really

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:40.770 align:middle line:84%
go for it much more than the
average lightworker or service

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:41.512 align:middle line:90%
soul.

00:38:41.512 --> 00:38:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Because they know
it's so important

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:44.053 align:middle line:90%
that that mission happens.

00:38:44.053 --> 00:38:45.030 align:middle line:90%
It's very precious.

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:47.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the whole
meaning of their life.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.190 align:middle line:90%
And they'll search for that.

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And they'll try out
lots of different things

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:54.129 align:middle line:84%
to find out-- well, it's a
process of elimination, really,

00:38:54.129 --> 00:38:56.420 align:middle line:84%
and also a process of getting
clear enough emotionally.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.628 align:middle line:84%
But when they get clear
enough emotionally, or enough

00:38:58.628 --> 00:39:02.904 align:middle line:84%
of them is embodied and grounded
in the DNA and the souls,

00:39:02.904 --> 00:39:04.320 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to
hit what we call

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:09.870 align:middle line:84%
a point of soul integration,
where we've reached enough

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:13.330 align:middle line:84%
of ego dissolution so that
the soul actually takes over,

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.775 align:middle line:84%
so that the feelings and
thoughts of the personality

00:39:15.775 --> 00:39:18.000 align:middle line:90%
and the soul are synchronized.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.525 align:middle line:84%
So the ego is no
longer in charge.

00:39:19.525 --> 00:39:21.260 align:middle line:90%
So it has let go.

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the mission
really starts to reveal itself.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And not many people get there
simply because the density

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:28.910 align:middle line:90%
we carry.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:31.115 align:middle line:84%
But when they do,
what happens then

00:39:31.115 --> 00:39:33.560 align:middle line:84%
is that you move to a
life of flow and bliss,

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.110 align:middle line:84%
because the higher consciousness
is actually literally

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:39.000 align:middle line:84%
manifesting everything
around them.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Because this
reality, this matrix,

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.380 align:middle line:84%
is actually only a projection
of higher consciousness

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:45.560 align:middle line:90%
onto a screen.

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Nothing comes from
it in and of itself.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.140 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when
a walk-in reaches--

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:51.869 align:middle line:84%
or any human being
is on a path--

00:39:51.869 --> 00:39:53.410 align:middle line:84%
reaches a point of
soul integration--

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:56.260 align:middle line:84%
because everyone can do this--
the principles for integrating

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.580 align:middle line:84%
a walk-in are applicable to
anyone on a spiritual path.

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Once they reach that point,
what starts to trigger

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:04.100 align:middle line:90%
is their divine purpose.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And that literally emanates
from their higher heart chakra

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and creates a holographic
bubble around them.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:12.560 align:middle line:84%
So the consensus reality
which everyone unconsciously

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:16.416 align:middle line:84%
has agreed to no longer is
relevant for that individual.

00:40:16.416 --> 00:40:18.290 align:middle line:84%
They're literally creating
their own reality,

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:20.590 align:middle line:84%
a bubble around them,
a holographic bubble.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And it affects
everyone around them.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea here is that
enough walk-ins, or enough

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:29.440 align:middle line:84%
conscious souls,
do this, you have

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.190 align:middle line:84%
enough of these holographic
bubbles of higher frequency,

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:33.570 align:middle line:84%
guess what's going to
happen to the consensus?

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:34.730 align:middle line:90%
It's going to start to dissolve.

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Because the higher
consciousness will basically

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:39.010 align:middle line:84%
raise the frequency
of everything.

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:41.935 align:middle line:84%
That's actually what walk-ins
are trying to do, especially.

00:40:41.935 --> 00:40:44.365 align:middle line:84%
But when this opens--
their heart opens,

00:40:44.365 --> 00:40:46.410 align:middle line:84%
the higher heart
opens-- then they

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:48.494 align:middle line:84%
become very conscious
of their mission.

00:40:48.494 --> 00:40:49.910 align:middle line:84%
But they have to
get clear enough,

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:51.368 align:middle line:84%
and come out of
the unconsciousness

00:40:51.368 --> 00:40:52.315 align:middle line:90%
of their personality.

00:40:52.315 --> 00:40:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And everyone has their
own unique journey.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:58.192 align:middle line:84%
And walk-ins often have
particularly challenging

00:40:58.192 --> 00:40:59.650 align:middle line:84%
journeys, because
they need to know

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:00.775 align:middle line:90%
what it's like to be human.

00:41:00.775 --> 00:41:04.511 align:middle line:84%
So they may extreme
disempowerment, extreme trauma.

00:41:04.511 --> 00:41:06.885 align:middle line:84%
And they have all sorts of
things which most people would

00:41:06.885 --> 00:41:08.051 align:middle line:90%
find very hard to cope with.

00:41:08.051 --> 00:41:10.790 align:middle line:84%
But because of the power
of the soul, they can cope.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And having been through
that intense experience,

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:14.900 align:middle line:84%
they can relate to what
most people go through.

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Therefor, they can related their
higher consciousness message

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:17.660 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.640 align:middle line:84%
You can't do that if
you don't understand

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:20.654 align:middle line:90%
what it is to be human.

00:41:20.654 --> 00:41:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: That's right.

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's actually sort of a
general view of the experience.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And they will follow
their particular challenge

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:29.800 align:middle line:84%
which is laid out in
the soul contract.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.035 align:middle line:90%
And that will be their gift--

00:41:31.035 --> 00:41:32.035 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:41:32.035 --> 00:41:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: --that
they will deliver.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.240 align:middle line:84%
So they're all
different variations.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.450 align:middle line:90%
No one is ever the same.

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And they get to that purpose
in their own unique way.

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And it seems it's
not a linear path.

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:43.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a very curved path.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.021 align:middle line:90%
You go around here.

00:41:45.021 --> 00:41:46.020 align:middle line:90%
You hit some roadblocks.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.620 align:middle line:90%
You move around those.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.717 align:middle line:84%
And it's about just
following the heart,

00:41:49.717 --> 00:41:51.300 align:middle line:84%
eventually, when it
gets clear enough.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.595 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, if they keep at
it, the mission will show up.

00:41:54.595 --> 00:41:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.242 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: But it requires
a lot of dedication.

00:41:57.242 --> 00:41:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: One other
person-- and you know her.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.616 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was maybe through
your connection with her?

00:42:01.616 --> 00:42:04.770 align:middle line:84%
You can tell me-- that
figured this out for herself

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:08.460 align:middle line:84%
with a very interesting
and unique skill

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.330 align:middle line:84%
set-- is an
interviewee here, also,

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Susie Miller, who has
the unique ability

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.500 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
telepathically communicate

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.000 align:middle line:90%
with autistic children.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.190 align:middle line:84%
She and physicist
Dr. William Tiller

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:25.400 align:middle line:84%
are doing this amazing
consciousness experiments

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.930 align:middle line:84%
with these kids, in terms
of helping bring them out

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:31.200 align:middle line:84%
so that they can
start integrating

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.760 align:middle line:90%
with the body better.

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And Susie is-- she's a
lovely soul, herself.

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.080 align:middle line:84%
But she's being of
tremendous service

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.260 align:middle line:84%
in helping some of
these people who

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.750 align:middle line:84%
are appearing to be autistic
bring the soul in to find

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:49.420 align:middle line:84%
that they have very advanced
knowledge and purpose

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:50.330 align:middle line:90%
here on planet Earth.

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about the phenomena
of walk-ins, also, and autism.

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Does this occur as well?

00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Are some of the kids,
perhaps, or people

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:02.700 align:middle line:84%
who are considered autistic
just having these integration

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:06.990 align:middle line:84%
issues on that level-- or
is that wholly separate?

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:10.402 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: It's not an area I
have a lot of expertise in.

00:43:10.402 --> 00:43:12.110 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the
children who are labeled

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:15.800 align:middle line:84%
with ADHD and autism
and things that-- often

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:20.196 align:middle line:84%
this is because the orientation,
the way they consciously

00:43:20.196 --> 00:43:22.070 align:middle line:84%
engage with reality--
because on every planet

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:23.600 align:middle line:90%
we relate differently.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Because our emotional and mental
bodies are built differently--

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.540 align:middle line:84%
they're coming in
from a different place

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.210 align:middle line:84%
to bring a different
consciousness in.

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.543 align:middle line:84%
Just because the current
system doesn't understand that,

00:43:33.543 --> 00:43:35.616 align:middle line:84%
it's labeled as
something is wrong.

00:43:35.616 --> 00:43:37.530 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
necessarily the case.

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:39.196 align:middle line:84%
It's more like we're
trying to-- they're

00:43:39.196 --> 00:43:41.060 align:middle line:84%
trying to bring in a
different paradigm.

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:43.159 align:middle line:84%
And it may be that the
density of the place

00:43:43.159 --> 00:43:45.200 align:middle line:84%
is just too much for them
to cope with, because--

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's what
it would appear.

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: And so
they're sort of here.

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:50.055 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when
we make an assessment

00:43:50.055 --> 00:43:52.210 align:middle line:84%
from the higher
dimensions coming in,

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:54.950 align:middle line:84%
we can misjudge just
how dense it is.

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And so they can come and
realize, oops, I've got stuck.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Because I
went a bit too far.

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
they're not here.

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:01.815 align:middle line:90%
And they're not there.

00:44:01.815 --> 00:44:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Yeah, a bit too far
in creating the situation,

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:05.881 align:middle line:84%
trying to bring my
higher frequency--

00:44:05.881 --> 00:44:09.180 align:middle line:84%
and they can't relate to me at
all if I'm labeled in a certain

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.730 align:middle line:90%
way, I'm given drugs, whatever.

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And therefore I'm
getting trapped.

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I can't actually
break out of this.

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:16.407 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that can happen a lot.

00:44:16.407 --> 00:44:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: And so maybe some
of the children are walk-ins.

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:21.300 align:middle line:84%
I haven't worked
with any directly.

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.600 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:26.550 align:middle line:84%
But there are certainly
very higher frequency souls

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:28.630 align:middle line:84%
bringing a different
dimension of love.

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And Susie has been
brilliant at working with them

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:34.400 align:middle line:84%
as a result of-- and I
think her discovery that--

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.550 align:middle line:84%
it appears she also,
at a young age,

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:41.200 align:middle line:84%
had this same transition you had
as a walk-in and came for this

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:41.700 align:middle line:90%
purpose.

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.800 align:middle line:84%
She was a speech pathologist,
and then kind of, as you say,

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:50.440 align:middle line:84%
bumped into this
particular area.

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Autism wasn't what she
had set out to do--

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and then found she had this
unique ability as the walk-in

00:44:56.070 --> 00:45:00.800 align:middle line:84%
being, higher dimensional being
that she is, by nature she was

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.830 align:middle line:90%
able to do this communication.

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're bringing
them into integration.

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, they're having some
very interesting result, she

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.465 align:middle line:90%
and William Tiller.

00:45:09.465 --> 00:45:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Yeah, well, it probably
was one of the main reasons.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:14.210 align:middle line:84%
But walk-ins usually
have many skills.

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:15.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the question of what's
actually needed here.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:16.345 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:45:16.345 --> 00:45:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I see
what you're saying.

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, they certainly
need what she's doing.

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:20.628 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: She connected.

00:45:20.628 --> 00:45:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And so she did her job
and is doing her job.

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, she
is doing her job.

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Also, you say-- and you
just mentioned this--

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.780 align:middle line:84%
that walk-ins often want
to wear a lot of hats.

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Because they come in with
a lot of different skill

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:34.530 align:middle line:90%
sets and intelligence.

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:37.160 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to
sort of propel themselves

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.680 align:middle line:90%
down just one path.

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Yeah, a walk-in will
have many different lifetimes.

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:44.970 align:middle line:84%
What a walk-in
soul will do is it

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:46.655 align:middle line:84%
will bring in particular
soul components

00:45:46.655 --> 00:45:48.720 align:middle line:84%
from its many
lifetimes, and it will

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:53.089 align:middle line:84%
produce a specific, unique
mix for this lifetime.

00:45:53.089 --> 00:45:54.380 align:middle line:90%
It'll make its best assessment.

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think we're going
to need this on this planet,

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:57.990 align:middle line:84%
because, oh, we have
a problem of this,

00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:59.530 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
very good on this.

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:01.113 align:middle line:84%
So we need to bring
that skill set in.

00:46:01.113 --> 00:46:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And they'll come in, they'll
start to use that skill set.

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:06.380 align:middle line:84%
But it may bring in
new ones in situ,

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.000 align:middle line:90%
depending on what goes on.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.920 align:middle line:84%
The higher self will decide,
OK, we need more Christ

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.817 align:middle line:84%
consciousness to
come in, for example,

00:46:12.817 --> 00:46:13.900 align:middle line:90%
that component to come in.

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Mhm, Christ
consciousness, yes.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.428 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: So different
parts will come in.

00:46:16.428 --> 00:46:18.637 align:middle line:84%
So some of these parts are
quite disparity different.

00:46:18.637 --> 00:46:19.344 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:46:19.344 --> 00:46:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Which, if you're
in a body, can feel,

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:23.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to reconcile
this part and this part.

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's oil and water.

00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:26.672 align:middle line:90%
And it can be a real conflict.

00:46:26.672 --> 00:46:27.880 align:middle line:90%
And they can be quite strong.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Because they need both skill
sets in different situations.

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:34.582 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: So often with a
walk-in it can be pulled in many

00:46:34.582 --> 00:46:35.790 align:middle line:90%
different directions at once.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:38.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's about just accepting
all the different parts of them

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and using whatever mix is
necessary in that moment

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.950 align:middle line:90%
for the mission.

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:45.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
can pretty much

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:48.610 align:middle line:84%
do-- a strong one can pretty
much do what they like here,

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:50.810 align:middle line:90%
in terms of being of service.

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:53.205 align:middle line:84%
OK, and once they get clear
enough in the personality.

00:46:53.205 --> 00:46:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you said--
also in your book--

00:46:55.080 --> 00:47:00.630 align:middle line:84%
that oftentimes there's a,
if not a confusion around

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:03.440 align:middle line:84%
sexuality and how all that's
supposed to work and come

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:07.590 align:middle line:84%
together, but even almost an
asexual or androgynous kind

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:10.005 align:middle line:84%
of feeling that
walk-ins often have.

00:47:10.005 --> 00:47:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: That's especially
strong at the beginning.

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Because we are androgynous
at a soul level.

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.340 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we choose
a polarized male-female

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.070 align:middle line:84%
orientation when
we're in a body.

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So it can be, initially
we're in a body, well,

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:23.071 align:middle line:90%
it's a man's body.

00:47:23.071 --> 00:47:24.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm meant to like women.

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Or a woman, I'm
meant to like men.

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:27.544 align:middle line:90%
Don't quite get that.

00:47:27.544 --> 00:47:29.835 align:middle line:84%
Then they go and try it out,
see, well, do I like this?

00:47:29.835 --> 00:47:30.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's not too bad.

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:33.820 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, it's my boyfriend
the previous soul had.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:35.917 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh I don't like him.

00:47:35.917 --> 00:47:37.000 align:middle line:90%
This is not going to work.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And they'll go off and
try something else.

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:40.840 align:middle line:84%
So there's
experimentation with that

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.270 align:middle line:84%
to find out where
their orientation is.

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Because they're trying to
balance the higher dimensional

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:49.520 align:middle line:84%
part of them with the
raw human emotional part.

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's like there's
an idea initially,

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:53.820 align:middle line:84%
but they have to go and
try lots of things on

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:56.964 align:middle line:90%
to see what actually works.

00:47:56.964 --> 00:47:59.380 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of unknowns,
actually, arriving in a body.

00:47:59.380 --> 00:47:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: Especially when
you start to go unconscious,

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.490 align:middle line:90%
as Drunvalo said.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:04.698 align:middle line:84%
Because you're trying to
reach up and stay conscious,

00:48:04.698 --> 00:48:06.880 align:middle line:84%
but, oops, I'm
sinking, I'm gone.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:07.590 align:middle line:90%
And we forget.

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:10.665 align:middle line:84%
And we become the personality
for quite a long time

00:48:10.665 --> 00:48:13.280 align:middle line:84%
until we start to
reach up and realize

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.580 align:middle line:90%
it's just a big program.

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, what am I going
to do about that?

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.561 align:middle line:90%
How do I clear all the stuff?

00:48:19.561 --> 00:48:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And they'll go and
search for tools.

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:23.635 align:middle line:84%
I searched for tools to
clear the unconsciousness

00:48:23.635 --> 00:48:24.870 align:middle line:90%
that he was talking about.

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:26.745 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew underneath
that was the answer

00:48:26.745 --> 00:48:27.690 align:middle line:90%
I was searching for.

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, and you did.

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:28.838 align:middle line:90%
You came through.

00:48:28.838 --> 00:48:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Your teacher was a really-- that
was really key in your life.

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Frank Alper and you were
able to work through not just

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:39.310 align:middle line:84%
his system, but expand on
it, bring the consciousness

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:42.320 align:middle line:84%
that your soul chose to bring
through to create the work you

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:45.340 align:middle line:84%
do, which is your soul
contract work using a higher

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:47.370 align:middle line:84%
dimension, so to
speak, of numerology.

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:50.020 align:middle line:84%
So you have very
specific purpose.

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Before we wrap up
this conversation,

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:57.630 align:middle line:84%
explain what has been the most
wonderful aspect of learning

00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:01.627 align:middle line:84%
this about yourself and
in assisting others.

00:49:01.627 --> 00:49:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: I think if you're going
to take someone who has tried

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:07.470 align:middle line:84%
everything in their life,
has felt lost, beaten down,

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:09.620 align:middle line:84%
by just being in the
reality, being in the matrix,

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:12.380 align:middle line:84%
and show them there
is an order to it,

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.130 align:middle line:84%
which is what the soul
contract work does,

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:17.199 align:middle line:84%
but then giving them the
specific tools to address

00:49:17.199 --> 00:49:18.990 align:middle line:84%
the different issues,
challenges they face,

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:20.090 align:middle line:90%
which seem insurmountable.

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
trying to solve them,

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:25.150 align:middle line:84%
solve, quote, "the
problem," from the place

00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:27.670 align:middle line:84%
of the lower conscious,
or the personality.

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:31.025 align:middle line:84%
So what walk-ins do
is they bring a higher

00:49:31.025 --> 00:49:33.316 align:middle line:84%
level of consciousness and
say, well, have a loot at it

00:49:33.316 --> 00:49:33.560 align:middle line:90%
from up here.

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Then someone goes,
oh it's obvious

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:35.740 align:middle line:90%
what we have to do here.

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.090 align:middle line:84%
But from down here,
I couldn't see it.

00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:40.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's seeing someone
open and flower

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:42.940 align:middle line:90%
and bring their mission online.

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:48.322 align:middle line:84%
That's the most satisfying thing
I have in working with people.

00:49:48.322 --> 00:49:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Especially when they do it,
they actually come online

00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:52.850 align:middle line:90%
and they remember who they are.

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
don't manage to do that,

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.380 align:middle line:84%
because they got stuck
in their personality.

00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
not walk-ins, it's

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.632 align:middle line:90%
just lightworkers, in general.

00:50:00.632 --> 00:50:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes,
lightworkers, in general.

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: It's easy to
get lost in the swamp

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.440 align:middle line:90%
of the personality.

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And for yourself, the most
wonderful and amazing thing

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:09.980 align:middle line:90%
of this experience?

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:14.190 align:middle line:10%
>> NGAN: I think having my
son, who I've managed to keep

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:22.160 align:middle line:10%
conscious, and seeing him
have a much easier life,

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.925 align:middle line:10%
raising him consciously so
that that spark of God we see

00:50:24.925 --> 00:50:28.347 align:middle line:10%
in kids' eyes when they're
born has stayed there at 13--

00:50:28.347 --> 00:50:29.930 align:middle line:10%
that's been the most
satisfying thing,

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:32.187 align:middle line:10%
that he will go off and
have an easier life,

00:50:32.187 --> 00:50:34.645 align:middle line:10%
but he will go off and deliver
his gift much earlier than I

00:50:34.645 --> 00:50:35.500 align:middle line:10%
ever could.

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NGAN: That's been the
most satisfying thing.

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's the thing
about conscious parenting,

isn't it?

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:43.417 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for this.

00:50:43.417 --> 00:50:44.500 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate your sharing.

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:48.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a very vulnerable subject,
because it's just so odd.

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:49.930 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
are, what is this?

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:51.240 align:middle line:90%
Is this sci-fi?

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:52.870 align:middle line:90%
No, this is not sci-fi.

00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:53.945 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:50:53.945 --> 00:50:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: Yes, it's very real.

00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:57.456 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the few
people that I've met that are

00:50:57.456 --> 00:51:01.610 align:middle line:84%
walk-ins, every one of them
is a very, I would say,

00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:03.370 align:middle line:90%
gentle and beautiful soul.

00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And love figures very
high on the level

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:09.420 align:middle line:84%
of what they choose to
share with the world.

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:10.450 align:middle line:90%
And you're among them.

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:11.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NGAN: Thank you, Regina.

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.500 align:middle line:84%
It's been a pleasure
working with you.

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:16.920 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: If you or someone
you love is displaying most

00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:19.570 align:middle line:10%
of these traits, then you may
want to contact David through

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:23.580 align:middle line:10%
his website at the
centerforconsciousascension.net,

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.290 align:middle line:10%
and they'll get
the proper support.

00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:27.520 align:middle line:10%
I hope this conversation
has added some clarity

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.200 align:middle line:10%
and compassion for anyone you
see struggling in this way,

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.550 align:middle line:10%
as many new souls are coming
into Earth to help now.

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:37.484 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
