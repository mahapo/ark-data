00:00:27.535 --> 00:00:28.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
How many times

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.368 align:middle line:10%
have we found
ourselves complaining

00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:32.320 align:middle line:10%
that we have no energy?

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.080 align:middle line:10%
When we feel sluggish, the
voltage in our cell is sub par.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And if it goes on long enough,
we have chronic disease.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.551 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jerry Tennant brought
himself back to life

00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:42.675 align:middle line:84%
with one little dog cuddled
around his head and one

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:44.430 align:middle line:84%
at his spleen,
and he'll tell you

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.230 align:middle line:84%
he was using their voltage to
recover from a serious illness.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Since then, he's done
breakthrough work

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.630 align:middle line:84%
in helping medical
professionals understand

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.460 align:middle line:84%
that healing is a
matter of voltage,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.530 align:middle line:90%
and our body is the battery.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is really a very
simple, but revolutionary, way

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.774 align:middle line:90%
to look at healing.

00:01:00.774 --> 00:01:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And I know there are others--
the body electric and such--

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.810 align:middle line:84%
who've gone before
you and written

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.230 align:middle line:90%
lovely books on the subject.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.720 align:middle line:84%
But you've put it in--
you've put it down in a way

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.920 align:middle line:84%
that the lay person can
actually understand.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.920 align:middle line:84%
This is a battery, and
when the voltage runs low--

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.680 align:middle line:90%
if it runs too low-- we're gone.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.430 align:middle line:10%
>>DR. JERRY TENNANT:
That's exactly right.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.980 align:middle line:10%
And I think in order to
understand this paradigm,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.130 align:middle line:10%
we have to talk a little bit
about some electronic terms

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.630 align:middle line:10%
and bring them into a way
you can understand them.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
start with you.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.780 align:middle line:84%
You got sick, and
then we're going

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.589 align:middle line:84%
to back into the
science part of it, OK?

00:01:39.589 --> 00:01:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: All right.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.900 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about you.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And also, you didn't
write this book

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:84%
as an M.D. Let's just
talk about what humanity

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.310 align:middle line:84%
is up against right now in
the Western world in even

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.220 align:middle line:84%
trying to find any sensible
ways of healing ourselves.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Which is goes back
to the statement

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.710 align:middle line:84%
I made-- you didn't
write this as an M.D.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.210 align:middle line:84%
You wrote it under the auspices
of a license pastoral health

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.140 align:middle line:90%
practitioner.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.157 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about
that part first.

00:02:09.157 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: Sure.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Well most people think that if
some university does studies

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
and proves that something is a
useful treatment that doctors

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.710 align:middle line:84%
can read those studies
and automatically

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.620 align:middle line:84%
start using that for their
patients, but that's incorrect.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.590 align:middle line:84%
In this country, we
have what's called

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.010 align:middle line:90%
standard of care medicine.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And what has happened is
that various positions

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.110 align:middle line:84%
have gotten around
tables and decided

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.880 align:middle line:84%
that for this diagnosis, it
must be treated this way.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And so your physician, each
time they make a diagnosis,

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:84%
must write down a diagnosis
code which activates

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.810 align:middle line:90%
the standard of care treatment.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So standard of care
treatment may not

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.060 align:middle line:84%
be exactly what
you want, but it's

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:84%
what your physician must do
or lose his or her license.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.310 align:middle line:84%
So for example, one of
my friends in Dallas

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.670 align:middle line:84%
had a heart attack and
was in the hospital,

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and the next morning they
brought a bunch of pills in

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.979 align:middle line:84%
and he said what's
that pill for.

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And the nurse said, well that's
to lower your blood pressure.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well
why blood pressure.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.604 align:middle line:90%
It's 90 over 50.

00:03:15.604 --> 00:03:17.270 align:middle line:84%
If you lower it any
more, I'll pass out.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You'll be dead.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: She
said, it doesn't matter.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.141 align:middle line:84%
It's standard of
care that anybody

00:03:21.141 --> 00:03:23.390 align:middle line:84%
who comes into the hospital
has to have blood pressure

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.190 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.898 align:middle line:84%
He said, well what's
that other pill for.

00:03:25.898 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:84%
She said, that's the
lower your cholesterol.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.010 align:middle line:90%
So what is my cholesterol?

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, we
haven't measured it.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.080 align:middle line:84%
So why do I have to
take a cholesterol pill?

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:90%
Because it's standard of care.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.950 align:middle line:84%
So the point is
that once someone

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:84%
proves that something
works, then they

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.990 align:middle line:90%
get that published in journals.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.890 align:middle line:84%
But then they have
to go to the FDA

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and basically
purchase from the FDA

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.970 align:middle line:90%
the right to say that it works.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the whole notion
that it works to begin with

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.660 align:middle line:90%
is flawed.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.370 align:middle line:84%
When you get into
the original studies,

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.930 align:middle line:90%
oftentimes they're flawed.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: That's true.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.510 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just
because they say it

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.609 align:middle line:84%
work-- that's a
whole other subject,

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't mean it actually
does work for most people.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.659 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: That's correct.

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So if we could do this
train of thought, and then

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.880 align:middle line:90%
I would like to comment on that.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume that I find
some way to magically cure

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.750 align:middle line:84%
x disease, then I can't have
a physician start using that.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.340 align:middle line:84%
What I have to do is that
I have to go to the FDA

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and pay millions of dollars over
a period of usually five years

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.720 align:middle line:84%
or more to get them to
say, OK now you can--

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.140 align:middle line:84%
we give you the permission
to say that it works.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And then once the
FDA approves it,

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.630 align:middle line:84%
you still have to get it as
part of standard of care.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.900 align:middle line:84%
So if a physician
tries to use something

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.700 align:middle line:84%
that is not standard
of care, the physician

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:90%
often loses their license.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a real
roadblock to progress

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.299 align:middle line:90%
in medicine in this country.

00:04:55.299 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Now the second one
that you mentioned

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.090 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the way
medical studies are reported.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.990 align:middle line:90%
So let me give you an example.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that six people out
of 100 have athlete's foot.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.030 align:middle line:90%
What percentage is that?

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BOTH: 6%.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT:
That's easy enough.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Now we give one group of
them green jelly beans,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and we discover that only three
out of 100 have athlete's foot.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.130 align:middle line:90%
So that's 3%, isn't it?

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.965 align:middle line:84%
So you would assume that one
would say in your article

00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:30.050 align:middle line:84%
or in your medical
journal that that's

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.250 align:middle line:84%
a 3% reduction in
athlete's foot.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's not reported that way,
it's reported as relative risk.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.245 align:middle line:84%
And since three
is 50% of six, it

00:05:41.245 --> 00:05:44.540 align:middle line:84%
will be reported that
green jelly beans reduce

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.550 align:middle line:90%
athlete's foot by 50%.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Well obviously that's sort
of true, but not really true.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a great way
to deceive people.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Every single medical
journal now reports

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.796 align:middle line:90%
things in relative risk.

00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So now let's expand that
out of a little bit.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that you have two
people out of 10,000 have

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.560 align:middle line:84%
a problem, and then you do
some treatment and one person

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.390 align:middle line:90%
out of 10,000 as a problem.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's 0.0001%
absolute risk reduction.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:84%
It'll still be reported
as a 50% reduction.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And so when you read
journal articles

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.770 align:middle line:84%
and say that
something works, you

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.860 align:middle line:84%
have to go back and
look at the real numbers

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:84%
because the summary that
the authors give says,

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.620 align:middle line:84%
green jelly beans
worked 50% of the time.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.680 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what happened
with cholesterol drugs.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.040 align:middle line:84%
If you look at-- if you read
the cholesterol studies-- which

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.910 align:middle line:84%
I've done, I spent a couple
of years reading them--

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.530 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that
the absolute risk

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.910 align:middle line:84%
reduction for coronary
artery disease

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.600 align:middle line:90%
is somewhere between 1% and 3%.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And yet, all of the articles
say that the relative risk

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.620 align:middle line:84%
reduction is somewhere in the
neighborhood of 50%, or even

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.780 align:middle line:90%
75%--

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.202 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's so deceitful.

00:07:07.202 --> 00:07:08.743 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: And
that's why doctors

00:07:08.743 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:84%
insist that if you have anything
that even suggests that you

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.530 align:middle line:84%
might have a
circulatory problem,

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:90%
you must get on these drugs.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is is that
the side effects of drugs

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.530 align:middle line:84%
are much higher
than the benefits.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT:
That's the problem.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.653 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even in
the world of medicine,

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:28.470 align:middle line:84%
when they're being honest,
the subject of cholesterol

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:34.100 align:middle line:84%
itself is extremely complex in
that high numbers in one person

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.780 align:middle line:84%
is a perfectly healthy
level for another person.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.610 align:middle line:84%
It might have some kind
of negative impact,

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:45.250 align:middle line:84%
and yet to just do this skewed
way of presenting information,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.310 align:middle line:84%
in addition to the nuance
of each individual body,

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.069 align:middle line:90%
makes it absolutely worthless.

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Well if
you read the studies, what

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.010 align:middle line:84%
you find is that-- and look
at them as a whole-- one

00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:01.150 align:middle line:84%
person out of 2000 is benefited
by reducing cholesterol

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.520 align:middle line:84%
by any means whatsoever--
whether it's diet,

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.970 align:middle line:90%
or drugs, or anything else.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One out of 2,000.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Only
one out of 2000.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And yet, higher
than 70% of people

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.130 align:middle line:84%
will have musculoskeletal
symptoms from these drugs.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.750 align:middle line:84%
It doubles the risk of you
dying from congestive heart

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.970 align:middle line:90%
failure, et cetera, et cetera.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And you have to remember
this-- all of your hormones,

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.980 align:middle line:84%
with the exception of
thyroid and adrenalin,

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.920 align:middle line:90%
are made from cholesterol.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you stop your body's
ability to make cholesterol,

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:84%
then you're not going to have
an adequate amount of hormones.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.299 align:middle line:84%
Do you think hormones
are important?

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:39.360 align:middle line:90%
Most people do.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for hitting
on that topic.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.300 align:middle line:84%
There are a few other-- there's
just a couple of others,

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.500 align:middle line:84%
actually, before we start
getting into your subject

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.850 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to touch
on because these were

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.790 align:middle line:84%
in your book, and I thought
because of the demographic

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.320 align:middle line:84%
of our audience, they
would find it interesting.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:90%
One of them is mammograms.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Talk to us about the
reality behind mammograms.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Well most of the
best studies about mammograms

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:08.890 align:middle line:84%
have been done in Europe, and
that has been largely done

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.590 align:middle line:90%
in the Scandinavian countries.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:84%
The results vary somewhat, but
the end message is the same.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And that is, for
example, one of the study

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.920 align:middle line:84%
showed that if you have a
mammogram every other year

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:29.770 align:middle line:84%
for 15 years it saves
one breast cancer death,

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.760 align:middle line:84%
but increases breast cancer
deaths overall four times.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.560 align:middle line:90%
In what?

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.800 align:middle line:90%
One of 100, you're saying?

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Or, one out of what?

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: No.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:45.330 align:middle line:84%
If you-- basically, the answer
is that if you have a mammogram

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:49.200 align:middle line:84%
every other year for 15 years,
you're four times more likely

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.540 align:middle line:84%
to die from breast cancer
than if you didn't.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.609 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:52.609 --> 00:09:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: So
one of the problems

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.510 align:middle line:84%
with early screening
of cancer of any kind--

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.730 align:middle line:84%
whether you're talking about
breast, or prostate, or colon,

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.340 align:middle line:84%
or whatever-- is
that we don't really

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:11.040 align:middle line:84%
know the date that cancer
began in any given person.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And we don't actually have
the best data-- particularly

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.800 align:middle line:84%
for an individual
person-- that if nothing

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.180 align:middle line:84%
were done for that cancer,
it started on this date

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.110 align:middle line:90%
and you died on the state.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.770 align:middle line:90%
So why is that important?

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Because they say that if
you catch it early that

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:32.790 align:middle line:84%
it reduces the number of deaths,
but that may not be true.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.160 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's probably not true.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Particularly with the
treatments that are being given.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.420 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that,
oh I caught it early

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to reduce
my likelihood of dying--

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.650 align:middle line:84%
the statistics
don't bear that out.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
cancer death statistics

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:84%
from the National
Cancer Institute

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:84%
from 1930 to the latest one that
I've seen-- which is, I think,

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:02.270 align:middle line:84%
2005 or so-- the number
of people per 1,000

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:84%
dying from any type of cancer
has been basically straight

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.350 align:middle line:90%
line since 1930.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Now there have been
some reductions and--

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Per capita, yeah.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Some reductions
in, say, stomach cancer,

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.000 align:middle line:84%
but there have been
increases in other cancers

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.290 align:middle line:90%
like uterine cancer and so on.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So there are a few
outliers, but basically

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.630 align:middle line:84%
the number of people
dying from cancer

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.304 align:middle line:90%
has not changed since 1930.

00:11:31.304 --> 00:11:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With all
these invasive,

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.090 align:middle line:90%
expensive, ghastly treatments.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: And
of course, if you

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:41.440 align:middle line:84%
look at the way they spin
it, they talk about more

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and more people are
living after a cancer

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.010 align:middle line:84%
diagnosis with the spin
that, oh we're getting

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:90%
better treating it.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.670 align:middle line:84%
No, we're not getting
better at treating it

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.330 align:middle line:84%
it's just that more
people have cancer.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.235 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, more people
are alive after having

00:11:57.235 --> 00:11:58.035 align:middle line:90%
had that diagnosis.

00:11:58.035 --> 00:11:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and also
there's the x factor

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.730 align:middle line:84%
of all those people that
are living with cancer all

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:02.550 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And one case I
remember reading about

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:11.750 align:middle line:84%
was a man who wouldn't go
the doctor-- not unusual,

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:84%
especially in the senior--
among seniors from the past.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.430 align:middle line:90%
Just, hey leave me alone.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.552 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing just fine.

00:12:19.552 --> 00:12:21.260 align:middle line:84%
He went through his
life and he was fine.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, by the time
he died, there was

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:84%
something that
indicated an autopsy

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and the man had very large
cancerous growth in his lung.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't aware of
it, he lived his life,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and he lived out to a good,
normal, kind of older age.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.225 align:middle line:84%
Now that same man--
that cancer may

00:12:40.225 --> 00:12:42.207 align:middle line:84%
have growing for 20
years in that spot.

00:12:42.207 --> 00:12:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: Yeah.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And again, if you look at this
idea of early cancer screening,

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:54.400 align:middle line:84%
the subject of prostate
cancer comes to the fore.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Both the United States and
the European common market

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.300 align:middle line:84%
decided to do studies
about that subject.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And so, they looked at men
who had a PSA test done

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.800 align:middle line:84%
at least every
other year and they

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.180 align:middle line:84%
compared those against what they
considered usual care-- which

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.370 align:middle line:84%
meant they may or may not
have gotten anything done.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And then they
looked at the number

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.140 align:middle line:84%
of men who died
from prostate cancer

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.820 align:middle line:90%
after a long period of time.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And in both the European
and American studies,

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.920 align:middle line:84%
the number of men dying
from prostate cancer

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.730 align:middle line:90%
was the same-- 0.7%.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.660 align:middle line:84%
But the difference
between the two groups

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.140 align:middle line:84%
is that those who
had a PSA test done,

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.340 align:middle line:84%
and if they were
positive, had a biopsy.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.604 align:middle line:84%
And if that was
positive, then they had--

00:13:45.604 --> 00:13:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Radical treatment.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.228 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT:
--radical treatment,

00:13:48.228 --> 00:13:54.040 align:middle line:84%
that group had the side effects
of urinary incontinence,

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.470 align:middle line:84%
sexual lack of performance,
all of those kinds--

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:02.910 align:middle line:84%
plus just the fear and
stress that comes with,

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:07.510 align:middle line:84%
hey I've got cancer, versus
the man who did nothing.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So what it showed
was that-- in both

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.120 align:middle line:84%
the European and
American studies--

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.160 align:middle line:84%
that your risk of dying
from prostate cancer

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.976 align:middle line:84%
was not improved if
you did PSA tests.

00:14:17.976 --> 00:14:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's why most of
the European countries

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.265 align:middle line:84%
now have banned the
use of that test.

00:14:22.265 --> 00:14:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the other interesting
thing about the PSA test

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:30.080 align:middle line:84%
is that it's said to be a
prostate specific antigen,

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:37.240 align:middle line:84%
but it's certainly not because
the test is positive in women.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And the fellow who invented
the test, who discovered

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:45.030 align:middle line:84%
how to do it, actually published
an article in, I think,

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:49.670 align:middle line:84%
the New York Times where
he stated his disgust

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:53.570 align:middle line:84%
at how his test had been
abused because he said,

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.250 align:middle line:84%
basically, it's not a
good predictive test

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.280 align:middle line:90%
for prostate cancer.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's a test for fungus.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Well then it gets into a
whole other subject regarding

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.526 align:middle line:90%
fungus cancer and so forth.

00:15:06.526 --> 00:15:07.566 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: Of course.

00:15:07.566 --> 00:15:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: But the point
is that the standard of care

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:84%
says that if you're over 40
you get a PSA test every year,

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:84%
and if it's positive you
get thrown into the system.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.780 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
what the European--

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.020 align:middle line:84%
the large European and
the large NIH study showed

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.329 align:middle line:90%
is what the science.

00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
for sharing that.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: You're welcome.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm glad I asked.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And I don't get into the-- I
was going ask you-- go ahead.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: You
hinted at this,

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.820 align:middle line:90%
but I want to say this openly.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Any time I give
lectures or interviews,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.810 align:middle line:84%
I always discuss the
fact that I'm not

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.520 align:middle line:90%
talking with my M.D. license.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.750 align:middle line:84%
But rather, I'm talking
under the umbrella

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.600 align:middle line:84%
of a private
expressive association.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is that
in all states-- including

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:05.570 align:middle line:84%
my state of Texas-- if I
give recommendations that

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.740 align:middle line:84%
are other than
standard of care, I'll

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.330 align:middle line:90%
be in trouble with my board.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.970 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to-- I'm
not speaking as an M.D.,

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:17.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking as a practitioner
under a private expressive

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:19.480 align:middle line:90%
association.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.318 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so we'll call
you Jerry instead of doctor.

00:16:22.318 --> 00:16:23.692 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT:
That works for me.

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, Jerry.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.117 align:middle line:84%
We really have more than two
or three hours of material

00:16:28.117 --> 00:16:29.950 align:middle line:84%
to do in one hour, so
I'm going to pass over

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.250 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of
this and really want

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.320 align:middle line:84%
to start jumping into
the notion of voltage.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.780 align:middle line:84%
So up till now, the
standard medical model

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:44.210 align:middle line:84%
is a chemical model in going
after whatever ails the body.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that, and then let's

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.590 align:middle line:84%
talk about why that
needs to be reviewed,

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.754 align:middle line:90%
and the electrical model.

00:16:50.754 --> 00:16:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT:
Well the reality is

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:54.180 align:middle line:84%
that if you have two
hydrogen ions that

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.460 align:middle line:84%
want to buddy up with
an oxygen to make water,

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.110 align:middle line:90%
what's the first thing they do?

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Exchange electrons.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.339 align:middle line:84%
The exchanging of electrons is
called physics, or electronics.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:10.010 align:middle line:84%
So basically, in
all of chemistry,

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:84%
it is first physics before
it becomes chemistry.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.190 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps even
though that is true,

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.220 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't really,
I think, give you

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:26.210 align:middle line:84%
the concept that you need to
understand about the importance

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.520 align:middle line:90%
of voltage in the body.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So here's the basic thing
that you have to The body

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:35.850 align:middle line:84%
is constantly
wearing itself out,

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and so we're constantly having
to make new cells to replace

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.770 align:middle line:90%
those that are worn out.

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:43.130 align:middle line:84%
So you get new cells in
the macular of your eye

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:84%
every 48 hours, the
lining of your guts

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.420 align:middle line:84%
replaced every three days, the
skin you're sitting in today

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.690 align:middle line:84%
is six weeks old, your
liver's eight weeks old,

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:84%
your nervous system's
eight months old.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So we're constantly
wearing ourselves out.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.625 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
renewing ourselves.

00:17:57.625 --> 00:17:58.458 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: Yeah.

00:17:58.458 --> 00:18:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So a chronic disease
of any kind only

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.077 align:middle line:84%
occurs when you lose the ability
to make new cells at work.

00:18:08.077 --> 00:18:10.160 align:middle line:84%
That's important enough,
I'd like to say it again.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Chronic disease only occurs
when you lose the ability

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.160 align:middle line:90%
to make new cells at work.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.800 align:middle line:84%
If you can't maintain yourself
as you wear yourself out,

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:18.600 align:middle line:90%
guess what?

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.250 align:middle line:90%
You get sick.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Well that easily draws us
to the question-- what's

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.280 align:middle line:90%
it to make new cells at work?

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, our cells are designed
to run at minus 25 millivolts

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.930 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:84%
To make a new cell requires
minus 50 millivolts.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So very basic for
making new cells

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.456 align:middle line:84%
is having the energy,
the voltage, to do it.

00:18:41.456 --> 00:18:42.830 align:middle line:84%
But in addition,
you have to have

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:46.050 align:middle line:84%
all of the parts it
takes to make a cell.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.950 align:middle line:84%
So the inside of cells
are made from amino acids.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.700 align:middle line:84%
So what's the body's
source of amino acids?

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.280 align:middle line:90%
Stomach acid.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.040 align:middle line:84%
The way the body is designed is
that, when you eat a protein,

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:84%
stomach acid breaks those
proteins into amino acids

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:03.612 align:middle line:84%
and now those are available
to make the inside of cells.

00:19:03.612 --> 00:19:05.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
have stomach acid,

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:07.830 align:middle line:84%
you can't keep
yourself maintained.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.860 align:middle line:84%
So what's it take to
make stomach acid?

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:15.216 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin B1, iodine, zinc,
salt, and the voltage to do it.

00:19:15.216 --> 00:19:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Now the outside
of cells are made

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.630 align:middle line:84%
of fats, very special
fats, called phospholipids.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.700 align:middle line:90%
But fats, nevertheless.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So what does it take to
absorb and make fats?

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:26.969 align:middle line:90%
You have to have bile.

00:19:26.969 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:84%
The liver makes a quart
and a half of bile a day,

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:30.300 align:middle line:90%
so it needs a storage tank.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.280 align:middle line:84%
The storage tank
is the gallbladder.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So you have a
gallbladder full of bile

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.900 align:middle line:84%
ready to dump into the digestive
process so you can absorb fat.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.980 align:middle line:84%
But what tells the
liver to make bile,

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and the gallbladder to dump
it into the digestive process?

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Our old friend, stomach acid.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:51.590 align:middle line:84%
When stomach acid hits
the small intestine,

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:84%
it causes the release of a
hormone called cholecystokinin.

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Well that funky word means--
chole means gall, cyst means

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.110 align:middle line:90%
bladder, kinin means move.

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Gallbladder move hormone.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So when stomach acid hits the
small intestine, that hormone's

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.735 align:middle line:84%
released, makes the
liver make bile,

00:20:11.735 --> 00:20:14.280 align:middle line:84%
the gallbladder
squeezes some out.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.040 align:middle line:84%
No stomach acid,
no cholecystokinin.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.520 align:middle line:90%
No cholecystokinin, no bile.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.435 align:middle line:90%
No bile, can't absorb fats.

00:20:21.435 --> 00:20:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Now you become deficient in all
your fat soluble vitamins-- A,

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.950 align:middle line:84%
D, E, and K. So we have to have
our old friend stomach acid.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Well then you have to have
vitamins and minerals.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Vitamins and minerals are under
control of a substance called

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.046 align:middle line:90%
fulvic-- F-U-L-V-I-C.

00:20:39.046 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which,
really, has only

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.255 align:middle line:84%
risen to the forefront
in the last decade or so

00:20:43.255 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:90%
of our awareness.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Talk about what fulvic
is and what humic is.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: In medicine it
is, but not in agriculture.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.050 align:middle line:90%
It's been around a long time.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:51.008 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:20:51.008 --> 00:20:52.400 align:middle line:90%
In medicine.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Well, if I may,
let me finish what cells need

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and then I want to come back
around to talk about fulvic.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:04.679 align:middle line:84%
So cells need-- we've said need
amino acids, they need fats,

00:21:04.679 --> 00:21:06.470 align:middle line:84%
and they need vitamins
and minerals-- which

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:08.230 align:middle line:90%
is under control of fulvic.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Well then you also
need oxygen. Now

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.810 align:middle line:84%
one of the interesting
things about oxygen

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:17.160 align:middle line:84%
is the amount of oxygen that
will dissolve in a liquid

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.920 align:middle line:84%
is dictated by the
voltage of the liquid.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Our cells about 70%-- some
people say as much as 90%--

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.950 align:middle line:90%
water.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So if a cell is going to be
able to have oxygen available,

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.540 align:middle line:84%
it has to have
enough voltage there.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.190 align:middle line:84%
But if the voltage
is low, the oxygen

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:40.080 align:middle line:84%
won't go into solution because
if I took this cup of water

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.460 align:middle line:84%
and I put a tube in it and
it started bubbling oxygen

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.230 align:middle line:84%
in there-- if I raise
the voltage of the water,

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:47.720 align:middle line:90%
more oxygen goes into solution.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.580 align:middle line:84%
If I lower the voltage of the
water, the oxygen comes out

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:90%
and the solution disappears.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:56.700 align:middle line:84%
So in our cells, if the
voltage drops oxygen goes away.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:90%
So that's a problem.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have
voltage in your cell

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.450 align:middle line:90%
to get oxygen into it.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.920 align:middle line:84%
But you also have to have
oxygen in the neighborhood.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.712 align:middle line:84%
You can have normal
voltage, but if there's

00:22:06.712 --> 00:22:08.295 align:middle line:84%
no oxygen in your
neighborhood there's

00:22:08.295 --> 00:22:09.780 align:middle line:90%
no oxygen in the neighborhood.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's under the
control of nitrate oxide.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:84%
So we need to have
nitric oxide available

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:84%
so we can have
oxygen. And if you

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.210 align:middle line:84%
look at the natural
curve of nitric oxide,

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:24.970 align:middle line:84%
essentially everyone in this
country, past the age of 40,

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.550 align:middle line:90%
is deficient in nitric oxide.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.430 align:middle line:84%
So we have to take that
as a supplement of being

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.920 align:middle line:90%
able to make that as well.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.110 align:middle line:84%
You also have to have water,
and water inside of cells

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:36.410 align:middle line:90%
isn't H2O.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:39.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a special kind
of water, H3O2,

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:84%
which Dr. Pollack the
fourth phase of water.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.174 align:middle line:84%
But it's an electron
donor form of water,

00:22:46.174 --> 00:22:47.090 align:middle line:90%
and so how do we get--

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he's done
breakthrough work--

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:49.020 align:middle line:90%
this is Gerald, right?

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:49.660 align:middle line:90%
Gerald Pollack?

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: Yeah.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: So how
is the primary way

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:57.460 align:middle line:90%
that we make kind of water?

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.700 align:middle line:90%
Infrared light.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So where do we find
infrared light?

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.690 align:middle line:90%
Outdoors.

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So if we pretend
that we are moles

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and spend our whole life
indoors or inside our car,

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:12.560 align:middle line:84%
we don't get that dose of
infrared light that we need.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:90%
We need to be outdoors.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
primary things it takes

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:21.300 align:middle line:90%
to make a cell that works.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.780 align:middle line:84%
But then we also have to look
at the third thing, and that

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.840 align:middle line:84%
is are there things
hanging around

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.800 align:middle line:84%
that will damage cells
as fast as we make them.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And the most common things
that damage cells fast-- and we

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:35.520 align:middle line:84%
make them-- are toxins
from dental infections,

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.436 align:middle line:84%
and heavy metals like mercury,
cadmium, lead, et cetera.

00:23:39.436 --> 00:23:42.060 align:middle line:84%
There are others, obviously, but
those are the most common ones

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:43.790 align:middle line:90%
that we've run into.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So we've been going
down this scenario

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:84%
of what it takes to
make a cell because we

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.859 align:middle line:84%
began this the conversation
of the role of voltage.

00:23:52.859 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:84%
So we'll get back to the
voltage in just a moment

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.580 align:middle line:84%
after I answer your
fulvic question.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.260 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Now fungus is amazingly
important to our planet.

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is indeed.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: If it
were not for fungus,

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.370 align:middle line:84%
we would all be
over our eyeballs

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:13.390 align:middle line:84%
in dead leaves and dead animals
because the job of fungus

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:19.120 align:middle line:84%
is to take dead, organic
material and turn it into dirt.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about a
leaf that's on a tree,

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:24.160 align:middle line:90%
it's covered with fungal spores.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.000 align:middle line:84%
But because the leaf is
alive, it has voltage.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.040 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, it has oxygen.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Now the leaf dies and
falls off the tree,

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:34.910 align:middle line:84%
the voltage goes
away because it's

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.460 align:middle line:84%
no longer attached to
the tree, and therefore

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.800 align:middle line:90%
the oxygen goes away.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
signal for the fungus

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.100 align:middle line:84%
to wake up and turn
that leaf into dirt.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, the dirt is actually a
collection of organic acids

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:53.880 align:middle line:84%
called humic-- H-U-M-I-C.
And one of the humic acids is

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.630 align:middle line:84%
fulvic-- F-U-L-V-I-C-- and
they work hand in hand,

00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:59.180 align:middle line:90%
but in different ways.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So they're sitting there in
the dirt, the wind blows a seed

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.270 align:middle line:90%
in, they get a little rain.

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:07.770 align:middle line:84%
So now the fulvic opens
the pores on the seed,

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:11.110 align:middle line:84%
the humic and the fulvic go
in, and that's the signal

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:90%
for the seed to start growing.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And now it grows into
a nice plant that's

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.770 align:middle line:84%
full of humic and fulvic,
so we harvest that plant,

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:22.560 align:middle line:84%
we eat, it now we have the
humic and fulvic we need.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.290 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is the farmer
practices in this country

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:27.475 align:middle line:90%
have eliminated that cycle.

00:25:27.475 --> 00:25:29.766 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's just what
I was going to ask you, yes.

00:25:29.766 --> 00:25:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: So we use
pesticides, and fungicides,

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and genetically
modified foods so

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.760 align:middle line:90%
that the fungus doesn't exist.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, our soil runs
out of humic and fulvic,

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.850 align:middle line:90%
so now the seeds won't grow.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:48.071 align:middle line:84%
So then we put fertilizer
on, so now the seed will grow

00:25:48.071 --> 00:25:49.570 align:middle line:84%
but they don't have
humic and fulvic

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.020 align:middle line:90%
of any consequence in them.

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So now we harvest
those foods, and now we

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.070 align:middle line:84%
run out of humic and fulvic
and so our cell membranes can't

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:02.100 align:middle line:84%
work correctly because fulvic is
one of the primary things that

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.560 align:middle line:84%
monitors the cell
membrane as to what gets

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.420 align:middle line:90%
and what doesn't get in.

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Plus, the interesting
thing about humic

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.620 align:middle line:84%
is it has every known
vitamin, every known mineral,

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.549 align:middle line:90%
every known amino acid.

00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's the Earth.

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: It's the Earth.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:22.590 align:middle line:84%
So, fortunately for us,
there are some deposits

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:29.260 align:middle line:84%
around the world where dead,
organic material was wet enough

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.500 align:middle line:90%
that it didn't turn into coal.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And that dead, organic
material is basically

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.330 align:middle line:90%
mines of humic and fulvic.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And so it's possible to
go and mine that and then

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:43.194 align:middle line:84%
turn it into a nutrient or
supplement that we can take.

00:26:43.194 --> 00:26:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some companies are
doing-- some people, companies,

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:46.520 align:middle line:90%
are doing that.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.478 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: Exactly.

00:26:47.478 --> 00:26:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the way
that we can overcome that.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Just as, for example, we
talked about nitric oxide,

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Nathan Brian is
a brilliant scientist

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.230 align:middle line:84%
at Texas Heart
Institute in Houston

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.760 align:middle line:84%
who is the first
person to ever develop

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.700 align:middle line:84%
his system for measuring
the nitric oxide in person,

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and also a tablet that you
can put on your tongue that,

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.020 align:middle line:84%
within six minutes, restores
your nitric oxide levels.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:12.820 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is
his name again?

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Nathan
Brian is Dr. Brian's name,

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and his product is
Neo-40-- N-E-O-40.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.940 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing product that I
put every patient past 40 on.

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.930 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it
fixes circulation.

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:28.730 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.983 align:middle line:84%
Every little child knows
that grandma has cold hands.

00:27:31.983 --> 00:27:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:34.013 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: The reason?

00:27:34.013 --> 00:27:35.430 align:middle line:90%
No nitric oxide.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:38.490 align:middle line:90%
Fix it in six minutes.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:40.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:45.410 align:middle line:90%
Now when-- OK.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the ways
in which our body starts

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.700 align:middle line:90%
losing its voltage, commonly.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.580 align:middle line:84%
In the way we live,
the foods we eat,

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.740 align:middle line:84%
certain foods
that, in your book,

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.740 align:middle line:84%
you write very
descriptively-- you

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.900 align:middle line:84%
have wonderful little
graphics and such as well

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:05.300 align:middle line:84%
to help the lay person
get it-- where electrons

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.270 align:middle line:84%
are being donated
and where electrons

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.020 align:middle line:90%
are being given or stolen.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think it'd be really
important for us to start

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.250 align:middle line:90%
learning that part of this.

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.710 align:middle line:10%
>>DR. TENNANT: Well to
understand how the body works

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:22.070 align:middle line:10%
electronically, you first
have to understand its battery

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:25.590 align:middle line:10%
system and its wiring system.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:84%
The human body is a
portable electronic device.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And all portable electronic
devices need a battery,

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:32.560 align:middle line:90%
don't they?

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Well it turns out
that our muscles are

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.870 align:middle line:84%
rechargeable batteries,
and they're also

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.060 align:middle line:90%
what's called Pizeoelectric.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And that funny word means
that if you take something

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and stress it, and
it emits electrons,

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:49.060 align:middle line:90%
that's called Piezoelectricity.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So when I do my arm like
this, I'm stressing my muscles

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and they're
generating electrons.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, my muscles are
also rechargeable batteries.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm doing this, I'm
recharging my muscle batteries.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Our muscles are surrounded by a
white, fibrous substance called

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:10.630 align:middle line:90%
the fascia.

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.330 align:middle line:84%
All of us have seen that at
Christmas and Thanksgiving

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:15.170 align:middle line:90%
time when we carve the turkey.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:18.510 align:middle line:84%
All that shiny stuff around
the muscles is call fascia.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:21.180 align:middle line:90%
Now fascia is a semiconductor.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.635 align:middle line:90%
So what's a semiconductor?

00:29:22.635 --> 00:29:25.460 align:middle line:84%
A semiconductor is
simply an arrangement

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:28.320 align:middle line:84%
of molecules that
allows electrons

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.780 align:middle line:84%
to move at the speed of
light through them, but only

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.250 align:middle line:90%
in one direction.

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So our muscles are surrounded by
this fascia, which is basically

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.600 align:middle line:90%
the body's wiring system.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And so we can move electrons
from the batteries, which

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:48.160 align:middle line:84%
are our muscles, to places we
need them, to whatever organ

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.190 align:middle line:84%
we need them, at
the speed light.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.770 align:middle line:84%
That's why if you put an
essential oil on your big toe,

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.784 align:middle line:84%
it's in your brain that
quick because it sends the--

00:29:56.784 --> 00:29:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
through the fascia.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT:
--through the fascia.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:03.792 align:middle line:84%
Well now I have to talk a
little bit about acupuncture.

00:30:03.792 --> 00:30:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's--

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: For a very long
time, nobody's really known

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.705 align:middle line:84%
want an acupuncture
meridian was,

00:30:08.705 --> 00:30:11.630 align:middle line:84%
and there all sorts of
theories about what they are,

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:15.360 align:middle line:90%
but here's my take on that.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.007 align:middle line:84%
Every organ in the body
has its own battery pack.

00:30:19.007 --> 00:30:20.090 align:middle line:90%
Let me say that once more.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Every single organ in the
body has its own battery pack.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And that battery pack
is a very specific stack

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.900 align:middle line:90%
of individual muscles.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So our muscles are stacked
together, hooked together,

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:35.580 align:middle line:84%
very much like you
putting several batteries

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.760 align:middle line:90%
in a flashlight.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And so, for example, if you
want to think about the battery

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:44.210 align:middle line:84%
pack for my heart, it starts
here my little finger,

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:47.430 align:middle line:84%
goes up-- its these muscles-- it
goes up here, goes over there,

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.480 align:middle line:84%
goes around to my shoulder,
goes into my heart.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.710 align:middle line:84%
That's the battery
pack for my heart,

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and that is called the
heart acupuncture meridian.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.350 align:middle line:84%
So an acupuncture
meridian is simply

00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:59.555 align:middle line:90%
a stack of muscle batteries.

00:30:59.555 --> 00:31:02.240 align:middle line:90%


00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If I
can-- this is just

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.271 align:middle line:90%
kind of an aside, but on point.

00:31:06.271 --> 00:31:09.200 align:middle line:84%
30 years ago, I
was tracking down

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.550 align:middle line:84%
energy and medicine
in Europe, and I

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:15.530 align:middle line:84%
did a story with a man named
Dr. Jean Claude Darras who,

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:19.540 align:middle line:84%
at that time, was a hero in
Asia because what he had done

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.650 align:middle line:84%
is they have these
acupuncture meridian

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:23.820 align:middle line:84%
charts that they'd
used historically,

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.430 align:middle line:90%
but there was no proof.

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:27.690 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't open it up
and look at it as you could

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:29.450 align:middle line:90%
our circulatory system.

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And what he did was he
proved the existence of this

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:37.480 align:middle line:84%
by shooting radioactive isotopes
into one of the meridians

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.370 align:middle line:84%
and watching the migration
patterns-- the speed where they

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:42.550 align:middle line:90%
went-- and then all bore out.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:45.020 align:middle line:84%
This meridian system
you're talking about

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:46.950 align:middle line:90%
is a physical reality.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.260 align:middle line:84%
I just bring that up
to say it has been done

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.920 align:middle line:90%
in the Western medical model.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: Yeah.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:32:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So what happens then is when
we want to consider an illness,

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:04.500 align:middle line:84%
we must consider
its power supply.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So you tell me you
have angina, then

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I know that you have low
voltage in the battery pack

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.270 align:middle line:84%
that supplies voltage
to your heart.

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And so all I have
to do, then, is

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:19.730 align:middle line:84%
go figure out why is the voltage
low in that battery pack.

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Or another way of
saying it-- why

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:27.020 align:middle line:84%
can't the battery pack for
your heart maintain a charge?

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Maintain a voltage-- it's
charge-- because if it could,

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:34.760 align:middle line:84%
then, almost certainly, you
would repair your heart.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.770 align:middle line:84%
You'd make new cells at work,
and your heart would work fine.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So then what one
has to do, then,

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.910 align:middle line:84%
is go through sort
of a checklist

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK what are the
things that are affecting

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.840 align:middle line:90%
that particular circuit.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Now one of things you also
have to begin to realize

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:57.850 align:middle line:84%
is that all of the
acupuncture circuits

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:02.330 align:middle line:84%
began in either a
hand or a foot, and--

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those are
like the terminus.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Yeah, that's
basically where-- Yeah.

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:06.090 align:middle line:90%
Where it starts.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
ears, too, right?

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: That's the
first battering in the pack.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First
battery in the pack.

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:10.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: And
so it runs up a leg,

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:17.230 align:middle line:84%
but it goes all the way
to the top-- to the brain.

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Or it starts in the fingers,
and it comes up all the way

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.980 align:middle line:84%
to the brain on its way
to wherever it goes.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And on its way
through the skull,

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:28.610 align:middle line:84%
it goes through
very specific teeth.

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:34.060 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, one of the
more important cir-- by the way,

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:37.040 align:middle line:84%
you have a circuit that goes
up and one that goes back down.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.870 align:middle line:84%
So the spleen stomach--
the spleen circuit

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.560 align:middle line:84%
starts in your big toe,
goes all the way up

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.070 align:middle line:84%
to the frontal
lobes of the brain,

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:45.986 align:middle line:84%
hooks on to what's called
the stomach circuit,

00:33:45.986 --> 00:33:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and goes all the way
back down to the foot.

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Now the spleen
stomach circuit is

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:51.848 align:middle line:84%
one of the more important
circuits in the body,

00:33:51.848 --> 00:33:53.740 align:middle line:84%
in my view, because
it's the battery

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:57.140 align:middle line:84%
pack for the entire
reproductive system,

00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:00.400 align:middle line:84%
for all of the endocrine system,
and for the frontal lobes

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.315 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:34:01.315 --> 00:34:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's important.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Including
the maculars of your eye.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.070 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, when
the spleen circuit

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:11.670 align:middle line:84%
comes up and gets to the
frontal lobes of your brain

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:15.469 align:middle line:84%
and switches over to
the stomach circuit,

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:17.110 align:middle line:84%
it's the power supply
to the macular.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:19.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a patient
with macular degeneration,

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:20.100 align:middle line:90%
guess what?

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.370 align:middle line:84%
It always has low
voltage-- stomach circuit.

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:25.409 align:middle line:84%
Let me just ask
you at this point.

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Are you indicating, then,
that acupuncture would be

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.770 align:middle line:90%
one of the primary paths, then?

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Well look,
acupuncture, historically,

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:37.260 align:middle line:84%
was sticking a
needle into a spot

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and noticing that it changed
the health of that person.

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:48.280 align:middle line:84%
But my view on that is that
a needle acts like an antenna

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.889 align:middle line:84%
and takes some
electrons out of the air

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:56.000 align:middle line:84%
and goes through that-- it helps
recharge that battery pack.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Now certainly when I
was in China in 1978,

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.570 align:middle line:84%
a very long time ago, what
they would do is put them in

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and they would still clip on
to them with electric power

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.600 align:middle line:84%
sources because
it's more efficient.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: We found, of
course, you don't need needles.

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:19.810 align:middle line:84%
You could very easily-- if you
have the appropriate waveform

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and the appropriate frequency,
you can easily recharge

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:26.277 align:middle line:84%
the battery packs with electrode
devices, like my biomodulator--

00:35:26.277 --> 00:35:27.110 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:27.990 align:middle line:84%
You created one
for that purpose.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT:
--just recharges it.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to be
careful when you're

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.480 align:middle line:84%
talking about
acupuncture and you're

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.570 align:middle line:84%
saying that the most
efficient way to treat

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:38.860 align:middle line:84%
macular degeneration, for
example, is with needles.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:39.660 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.700 align:middle line:84%
The most efficient
way is figure out

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:44.630 align:middle line:90%
why the stomach has low voltage.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:47.460 align:middle line:84%
But while you're figuring it
out and fixing it, plug into--

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give it a little
bit of extra voltage.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.668 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: --terminals
because all of our battery

00:35:51.668 --> 00:35:54.910 align:middle line:84%
packs in our body have specific
areas that are terminals,

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:56.800 align:middle line:84%
like the terminals
on your car battery,

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.100 align:middle line:84%
where you would go
clamp in to recharge it.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.770 align:middle line:90%
We have specific ones.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
a starting place?

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: Yeah.

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:05.499 align:middle line:84%
So you recharge
the battery pack,

00:36:05.499 --> 00:36:07.040 align:middle line:84%
and then while you're
doing it you're

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.920 align:middle line:84%
answering the question-- why was
it that this battery pack could

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.650 align:middle line:90%
not hold its charge?

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, a common one is
hyperthyroidism thyroid hormone

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.800 align:middle line:84%
T3 controls the voltage
of every cell membrane--

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And isn't
that an epidemic now?

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: Yes.

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And T2 controls the voltage
of the mitochondria.

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So you have to look
at T3 in particular,

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:32.710 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately most
blood tests for a thyroid

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:33.780 align:middle line:90%
do not look there.

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:37.730 align:middle line:84%
They look at either T4,
or, even worse, at TSH.

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:40.800 align:middle line:84%
TSH is the least reliable
of the thyroid tests,

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.260 align:middle line:84%
even though it's the one
that is standard of care.

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.130 align:middle line:90%


00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:49.030 align:middle line:84%
So you have to look
at hyperthyroidism.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Next thing you have
to look at is scars.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So because the fascia
is a wiring system,

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:01.660 align:middle line:84%
if you put a scar
across and it goes down

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and touches the fascia, it
creates a short or a ground.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And so it drains off
some of the voltage,

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:11.860 align:middle line:84%
just like leaving the
dome light on in your car.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll see is that,
commonly, a scar is not

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:18.140 align:middle line:84%
sufficient to cause
an organ to fail,

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.850 align:middle line:84%
but it is sufficient
to turn off the pump

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:25.680 align:middle line:84%
inside of a tooth that keeps
the tooth from getting decay.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is that
a kid falls off their bike

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and they get a scar across their
knee-- which is, by the way,

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:36.200 align:middle line:84%
the spleen and stomach
circuit-- and within the year,

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.715 align:middle line:84%
they have decay in the molar
on that side-- upper molar

00:37:38.715 --> 00:37:40.140 align:middle line:84%
or lower premolar--
because those

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.470 align:middle line:90%
are the teeth in that circuit.

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Every tooth has a
pump inside of it

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.509 align:middle line:84%
that pumps fluid into the
mouth so that bacteria

00:37:46.509 --> 00:37:47.550 align:middle line:90%
can't get into the tooth.

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Well if you shut that pump
down, now you get decay.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Decay is more due
to pump failure

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:55.970 align:middle line:84%
than it is due to
eating too many sweets.

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:58.730 align:middle line:84%
That was proven at the
dental school in Loma Linda.

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is that you fall
off your bike, you get a scar,

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.474 align:middle line:84%
a year later you've got a
filling, a few years after that

00:38:06.474 --> 00:38:08.640 align:middle line:84%
you get a bigger filling,
a few years after that you

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.270 align:middle line:84%
get bigger filling, a few years
after that you get a crown.

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:13.915 align:middle line:84%
And soon after
you get the crown,

00:38:13.915 --> 00:38:15.590 align:middle line:84%
you get decay under
the crown which

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.390 align:middle line:84%
the dentist can't see because
the X-rays won't go through it.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then you
have a root canal.

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Then
you have a root canal.

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:23.992 align:middle line:84%
One root canal shuts down
63% of your immune system

00:38:23.992 --> 00:38:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and I just got through reviewing
the last 50 cases of cancer

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.750 align:middle line:90%
that I've seen in my office.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:34.273 align:middle line:84%
95% of them had a dental
infection, usually

00:38:34.273 --> 00:38:37.070 align:middle line:84%
a root canal, in the
same acupressure circuit

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:39.290 align:middle line:90%
as their primary cancer.

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:42.950 align:middle line:84%
So the thing that's worst
about dropping the voltage

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:45.900 align:middle line:84%
in a circuit-- we
didn't say this before,

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:51.410 align:middle line:84%
but-- when you go from minus
25 millivolts of electron donor

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:54.190 align:middle line:84%
and go to zero, and
then go to plus 30

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:57.900 align:middle line:84%
millivolts of electron stealer,
that's where cancer occurs.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Cancer occurs at
plus 30 millivolts.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to the kids-- the
kid with the cut on the knee.

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.350 align:middle line:90%
Now these things are inevitable.

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:07.766 align:middle line:84%
To a certain extent
in life, we're

00:39:07.766 --> 00:39:10.130 align:middle line:84%
going to have a few
scars here and there.

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:13.730 align:middle line:84%
How does one pump the voltage
back up in the presence

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:14.580 align:middle line:90%
a scar tissue?

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.955 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT:
Well first of all,

00:39:15.955 --> 00:39:18.800 align:middle line:84%
it's pretty easy to fix a
scar if you know how to do it.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.370 align:middle line:84%
If you have a
scar, first of all,

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:23.780 align:middle line:84%
the way that you know that
it's shorting out the system

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.570 align:middle line:84%
is that you have the person
make a ring like that

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:30.390 align:middle line:90%
and you see that they're strong.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Then you have them
touch the scar

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and you see that when
they're touching this car

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.950 align:middle line:84%
they go weak because
what's happening

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:39.165 align:middle line:84%
is the scar's created
a short or a ground

00:39:39.165 --> 00:39:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and when you touch that,
the whole body goes weak.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So now we know that
the scars a problem.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.126 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: And
then we've identified

00:39:46.126 --> 00:39:47.590 align:middle line:84%
what circuit it's
taken out, so we

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:50.940 align:middle line:84%
use that information to
go look at the-- which

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.490 align:middle line:84%
tooth is going to
have decay in it.

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:56.540 align:middle line:84%
But then if we simply put a
special essential oil on that,

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.670 align:middle line:84%
and then use the
magnetic field of things

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:03.850 align:middle line:84%
like my biotransducer over
that for three minutes,

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:05.460 align:middle line:90%
it will realign the molecules.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And the way you fixed
it is now you touch it

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.040 align:middle line:90%
and you're strong--

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Test it again.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.700 align:middle line:90%
And that holds?

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: Yes.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.870 align:middle line:84%
We keep looking at our
patients every year.

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:16.850 align:middle line:84%
They come back,
look at their scars.

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:18.700 align:middle line:84%
We've had two or three
we've had to redo,

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.544 align:middle line:84%
but most always it
stays once you fix it.

00:40:21.544 --> 00:40:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let
me ask you this.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.315 align:middle line:84%
What-- because it's so
common, it's electoral now.

00:40:25.315 --> 00:40:27.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't even know
what percentage of births

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.360 align:middle line:90%
come in through Cesarean.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:34.560 align:middle line:84%
What happens with a
horizontal cesarean scar,

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.070 align:middle line:90%
since they're horizontal now.

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Well you just
have to ask the question,

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.724 align:middle line:84%
what acupuncture battery
pack did you cut through.

00:40:40.724 --> 00:40:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's I'm asking.

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:42.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a big cut.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: And the
answer is that in the middle

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.670 align:middle line:84%
here-- this big
muscle that you can

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.690 align:middle line:84%
feel in the middle like that--
is called erectus abdominis

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:52.360 align:middle line:84%
muscle, and that's
the stomach meridian.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And then to the side of
it, and a bit deeper,

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:58.310 align:middle line:84%
is the muscle that's
the kidney right here.

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:00.890 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
a Cesarean scar,

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:04.470 align:middle line:84%
you have usually
blocked the voltage

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:10.000 align:middle line:84%
in both the stomach and
the kidney circuits.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And now, again, these
things can be reversed.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:16.260 align:middle line:84%
You can increase
the voltage, again,

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.718 align:middle line:84%
through-- as you
say-- using, like,

00:41:17.718 --> 00:41:19.940 align:middle line:84%
an essential oil in a device
like your biomodulator.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:20.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Are scenar or other
scenar devices similar?

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Well
they have-- you know,

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:41.669 align:middle line:84%
a Ford car is similar
to you a Cadillac,

00:41:41.669 --> 00:41:42.710 align:middle line:90%
but they're not the same.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there are degrees.

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: There are
degrees in how they work in what

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:47.900 align:middle line:90%
frequencies and so forth.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.740 align:middle line:90%
So there are similarities.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:51.739 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:41:51.739 --> 00:41:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
most people haven't

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.710 align:middle line:90%
heard of any of these things.

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: And there are
other ways that people do this.

00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:59.660 align:middle line:84%
For example, some people teach
to used mud packs on them.

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Which works, but it
takes a very long time.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.910 align:middle line:84%
You put the mud pack on
for 20 or 30 minutes,

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:07.870 align:middle line:84%
and you have to repeat
that 10 or 20 times.

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Whereas this other way,
you can almost always

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:12.590 align:middle line:84%
get it done in three
to five minutes,

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:14.760 align:middle line:90%
and then it's permanent.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.090 align:middle line:84%
So even the worst
kind of scarring,

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:19.132 align:middle line:84%
such as that, that's
cutting through your major--

00:42:19.132 --> 00:42:19.931 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: OK.

00:42:19.931 --> 00:42:21.605 align:middle line:84%
So we look at thyroid,
we look at scars,

00:42:21.605 --> 00:42:24.435 align:middle line:90%
and then we look at teeth.

00:42:24.435 --> 00:42:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's say
you've had two or three root

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.360 align:middle line:90%
canals now.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.230 align:middle line:84%
You're older, you've
had a few root canals.

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:30.030 align:middle line:90%
Now what?

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Well,
first of all, the dentists

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:35.810 align:middle line:84%
are the only
physicians that believe

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:38.420 align:middle line:84%
you can get away with living
and dead tissue in the body.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:40.716 align:middle line:90%
No other doctor believes that.

00:42:40.716 --> 00:42:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the way
you do a root canal is

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:44.520 align:middle line:84%
you drill a hole in
the top of the teeth,

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.995 align:middle line:84%
you reach an auger
in, and you twist

00:42:46.995 --> 00:42:49.120 align:middle line:84%
it and you rip out the
artery and rip out the nerve

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.530 align:middle line:90%
and kill the teeth.

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a dead
tooth in your body.

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, the dentists
delude themselves

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:56.480 align:middle line:84%
to think that if they shine
a laser down in there,

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.660 align:middle line:84%
or they put various
chemicals down in there,

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:00.980 align:middle line:84%
or various other
fillers down in there,

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.410 align:middle line:84%
that you can
sterilize the tooth.

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's wishful thinking
because, first of all,

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:09.850 align:middle line:84%
a tooth like a molar has
three miles of little tubules

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:11.430 align:middle line:90%
through it.

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:12.844 align:middle line:84%
There's no way
that you can shine

00:43:12.844 --> 00:43:14.260 align:middle line:84%
a laser down the
middle of a tooth

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:17.010 align:middle line:84%
and sterilize three
miles of tubules.

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:19.100 align:middle line:84%
In addition, the
roots at the bottom

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.550 align:middle line:84%
are still attached
to the blood vessels

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:23.530 align:middle line:90%
and the lymphatic system.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So there's still a pathway for
bacteria to come back up in.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So there was a very nice
study done by the Japanese,

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.940 align:middle line:84%
actually, where
they took people who

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:36.230 align:middle line:84%
were going to have wisdom teeth
pulled and they did a root

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:40.390 align:middle line:84%
canal on one side and
then they waited 150 days

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:42.160 align:middle line:90%
and pulled both teeth.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And the tooth that
had the root canal, 60

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:49.950 align:middle line:84%
some percent of the little
canals were infected.

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in the tooth where
nothing was done, only 1%

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.590 align:middle line:90%
of the tubules were infected.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:44:01.100 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that even a
well done root canal leaves you

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.270 align:middle line:90%
with an infected tooth.

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:03.456 align:middle line:90%
So now what do you do?

00:44:03.456 --> 00:44:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: And
a work by Boyd Haley

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.494 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Kentucky has

00:44:06.494 --> 00:44:08.710 align:middle line:84%
shown the one root
canal tooth shuts down

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:12.590 align:middle line:90%
63% of your immune system.

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's bad.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: So--

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:15.440 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.120 align:middle line:84%
I was going to
say, so some people

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.160 align:middle line:84%
are aware of some
of this information.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.910 align:middle line:84%
So they're deciding
to have a tooth pulled

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:22.870 align:middle line:90%
and have an implant put in.

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Well the point
is that-- the bottom line,

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:28.292 align:middle line:84%
you have to get the
infection out your mouth.

00:44:28.292 --> 00:44:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How do you do that?

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.458 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Because
what Dr. Haley has shown

00:44:31.458 --> 00:44:38.250 align:middle line:84%
is that the kinds of
toxins in a root canal

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:41.510 align:middle line:84%
are equivalent in
toxicity to the standard

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:43.730 align:middle line:84%
by which all human
toxins are measured,

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:45.650 align:middle line:90%
namely hydrogen sulfide.

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Or another way of saying it
is that the toxins coming out

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:53.620 align:middle line:84%
of a root canal tooth are
equal in poison to botulism.

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:58.845 align:middle line:84%
So what you have to
do is-- first of all,

00:44:58.845 --> 00:45:00.970 align:middle line:84%
it's my opinion that if
you have a root canal tooth

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:02.350 align:middle line:90%
you have to get rid of it.

00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:04.540 align:middle line:84%
If you're big toe dies and
you leave it there, guess

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:05.340 align:middle line:90%
what happens?

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gangrene.

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: If your appendix
dies and you leave it there,

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:09.790 align:middle line:90%
guess what happens?

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So I have personal
experience with this.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.680 align:middle line:84%
I had a root canal,
tooth number 14,

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.420 align:middle line:90%
which is in my spleen meridian.

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.310 align:middle line:84%
That one tooth put me
in bed for seven years

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:19.940 align:middle line:90%
and caused a bleeding disorder.

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.523 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the
part of the story

00:45:21.523 --> 00:45:23.860 align:middle line:84%
we didn't get to with your
little doggies hugging

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:25.117 align:middle line:90%
your bad spots.

00:45:25.117 --> 00:45:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: Yeah.

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And so a normal platelet
count is 150 to 350.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Mine dropped to 30.

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And 48 hours after I had
that root canal tooth pulled,

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.150 align:middle line:84%
and the infection taken
out of the bone around it,

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:44.340 align:middle line:90%
my bleeding disorder was cured.

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So the point is that
you just can't over

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:55.080 align:middle line:84%
emphasize how terribly
toxic root canals are.

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Now if you go back in time
to the work of Weston Price--

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes?

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Weston
Price was a dentist who

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:04.120 align:middle line:84%
suspected that this
would be the case,

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and so he would pull a
tooth and he would embed it

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.510 align:middle line:90%
under the skin of a rabbit.

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And within a week, the
rabbit had the same illness

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:13.360 align:middle line:84%
as the person who
owned the tooth.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.217 align:middle line:84%
So if a person came in
with crippling arthritis,

00:46:16.217 --> 00:46:18.550 align:middle line:84%
within a week the rabbit would
have crippling arthritis.

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's all there
in the teeth, in the roots.

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: It's all there.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And he even went so
far-- well he did this

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:25.860 align:middle line:84%
300 and some
times-- so it wasn't

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:30.280 align:middle line:84%
like he did it once or twice--
and then he would pull a tooth

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and put it in saline
in a sterile container

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.820 align:middle line:90%
and let it sit there for a week.

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And then he would
take the saline

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and run it through a filter, and
then take the filtered solution

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and inject it in the
rabbit and the rabbit

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.800 align:middle line:90%
would still get the disease.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.620 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
poisons coming out

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:51.510 align:middle line:84%
of the teeth-- I've actually
come to the position

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:55.140 align:middle line:84%
that I believe that if a
person has a chronic illness,

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:57.216 align:middle line:84%
they are better advised
to go to the dentist

00:46:57.216 --> 00:46:58.840 align:middle line:84%
before they go to
their family practice

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.760 align:middle line:84%
stop because almost
every person who

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:04.510 align:middle line:84%
comes into my office who's
sick is sick at least in part

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:07.760 align:middle line:84%
by the dental problem,
dental infections.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And I've come to see
that if a person has

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:15.510 align:middle line:84%
a dental infection, no matter
what I do it doesn't work.

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:17.450 align:middle line:84%
It will not overcome
a dental infection.

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:20.950 align:middle line:84%
That's how terribly toxic
and important they are.

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:24.070 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is, of
course, that the dental boards

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:28.610 align:middle line:84%
get after any dentist
who wants to practice

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:30.180 align:middle line:90%
in this sort of way.

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Dentists who go in
and pull root canals

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:37.530 align:middle line:84%
are in jeopardy of losing
their license because-- well

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:39.660 align:middle line:84%
just to give you an
example, I was teaching

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:43.200 align:middle line:84%
at a dental conference
in Houston last year

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and it was reported
at that meeting

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:50.196 align:middle line:84%
that the dean of a
nearby dental school

00:47:50.196 --> 00:47:52.070 align:middle line:84%
called all of his students
together and said,

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:53.903 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be a
dental meeting in town

00:47:53.903 --> 00:47:55.010 align:middle line:90%
this next weekend.

00:47:55.010 --> 00:48:00.890 align:middle line:84%
If I find out any of you go, you
will be expelled from school.

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:03.990 align:middle line:84%
So I can't prove that
that's true or not true,

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:06.910 align:middle line:84%
but that was what was
said at the meeting.

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:09.800 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, there
is tremendous pressure

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:14.720 align:middle line:84%
from medical boards and dental
boards to do root canals

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.940 align:middle line:90%
and not pull them.

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:18.390 align:middle line:84%
So I was going to
ask this a bit ago.

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:19.610 align:middle line:90%
I'll ask now.

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So let's say someone's
listening to this

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:23.760 align:middle line:84%
and they say, holy cow I
want to get rid of that.

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So you go to your dentist
and say, pull the tooth.

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:27.490 align:middle line:84%
But you don't want
to be toothless,

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:29.800 align:middle line:84%
so they're going-- the
next line of defense

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.010 align:middle line:90%
is usually an implant.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:32.890 align:middle line:90%
Then what?

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Well,
here's the issue.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:39.200 align:middle line:84%
If this is the size of
where your tooth was and you

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:43.570 align:middle line:84%
pull the tooth and there's no
infection there, no problem.

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:46.950 align:middle line:84%
You can just put a screw in
there, namely an implant.

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:49.030 align:middle line:84%
But you pull the
tooth and all of this

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:51.550 align:middle line:84%
is infection, so now
you clean out all this--

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:53.930 align:middle line:84%
and the infection bone
will be mushy bone,

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:55.470 align:middle line:84%
so you clean out
all that mushy bone

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:56.636 align:middle line:90%
and now the hole's that big.

00:48:56.636 --> 00:48:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So you can't screw
an implant in there.

00:48:58.300 --> 00:48:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you just put
cement in there, don't you?

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.008 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: Put in cement.

00:49:01.008 --> 00:49:06.160 align:middle line:84%
So what you have to do is--
what the really up to date

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.740 align:middle line:84%
dentists do is-- first of
all, because bone is very

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:12.410 align:middle line:84%
porous like a sponge and
because the blood supply in bone

00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:14.840 align:middle line:84%
is not very good--
that is to say,

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.910 align:middle line:84%
you can't usually get
rid of bone infections

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:22.340 align:middle line:84%
with antibiotics-- what
they do is they inject ozone

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:25.700 align:middle line:84%
because ozone is a gas
that will kill any bug.

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And so they clean out the
mush, inject the ozone,

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.175 align:middle line:84%
it goes out and sterilizes
the area temporarily.

00:49:32.175 --> 00:49:33.880 align:middle line:84%
It will always, of
course, come back

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.390 align:middle line:90%
if you don't do something else.

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And then they draw blood
out of the arm, put it

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:44.120 align:middle line:84%
in a centrifuge, and then the
fibrin that's in the blood

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.125 align:middle line:90%
collects in the middle.

00:49:45.125 --> 00:49:47.410 align:middle line:84%
You reach in with
tweezers, pull it out,

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:51.280 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of a little golden
looking gelatinous stuff.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Cut a chunk of that off and
stuff it down in the hole.

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:57.280 align:middle line:84%
That's called
platelet rich fibrin,

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and platelet rich
fibrin contains

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:03.280 align:middle line:84%
all of the chemicals
that tell a bone to heal.

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So now, that bone will
fairly quickly heal.

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:08.902 align:middle line:84%
And once it's healed, you go
back and put the implant in.

00:50:08.902 --> 00:50:10.360 align:middle line:84%
What you want to
do, though, is you

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.651 align:middle line:84%
want to be sure you get an
implant where the screws are

00:50:12.651 --> 00:50:17.450 align:middle line:84%
made of zirconium, which is
a synthetic diamond, which

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:21.335 align:middle line:84%
is an electron neutral
because the titanium post,

00:50:21.335 --> 00:50:24.890 align:middle line:84%
or screws-- all metals
are electrons stealers,

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:26.930 align:middle line:84%
and so they will
lower the voltage

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:28.720 align:middle line:84%
in the bone around
them, and they're

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:31.530 align:middle line:84%
much more prone to get
infected around the screw

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:32.970 align:middle line:90%
than zirconium.

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:36.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad I asked you about that.

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.340 align:middle line:84%
We just have really
a short time left,

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and there's so much
more to talk about.

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:43.700 align:middle line:90%


00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:46.010 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is an area
of your book it's

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:47.620 align:middle line:84%
interesting-- I
found it interesting,

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:49.467 align:middle line:84%
anyway-- maybe just
hop through it quickly

00:50:49.467 --> 00:50:50.550 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll do a route.

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Which is, why is that we
can just simply generate

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:57.570 align:middle line:90%
new parts like a salamander.

00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT:
Well Robert Becker

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:07.570 align:middle line:84%
was an orthopedic surgeon who
was interested in that subject.

00:51:07.570 --> 00:51:11.390 align:middle line:84%
He recognized that in the human,
if you lose a chunk of bone

00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:13.140 align:middle line:90%
you'll grow some more bone.

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.450 align:middle line:84%
But if you lose a
chunk of anything else,

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:16.575 align:middle line:90%
you replace it with a scar.

00:51:16.575 --> 00:51:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like a
finger top like me.

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.655 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT:
And so he wondered

00:51:19.655 --> 00:51:21.950 align:middle line:84%
why is it that the human
can make more bone,

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:24.660 align:middle line:84%
but can't make
more anything else.

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And he studied the salamander
because the salamander has

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:30.490 align:middle line:84%
all the same body
parts as a human,

00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:33.150 align:middle line:84%
but they can regrow
most anything.

00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So you pluck out a salamander's
eye, he grows a new one.

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:39.720 align:middle line:84%
You cut off his army, he
grows a new one, et cetera.

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So Becker began to study
this, and one of the things

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:47.360 align:middle line:84%
that he noticed is
that, first of all,

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:51.090 align:middle line:84%
if you measure the
voltage in a salamander,

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:54.280 align:middle line:84%
it runs at minus 10 millivolts
instead of the minus 25

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.070 align:middle line:90%
millivolts that a human does.

00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:57.720 align:middle line:90%
So he starts at 10 millivolts.

00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.760 align:middle line:84%
You cut off, the voltage
very quickly drops down

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.890 align:middle line:90%
to about plus 20 or so.

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, once that happens,
it stimulates the duplication

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:15.300 align:middle line:90%
of stem cells.

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, the
stump is-- the end

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:21.180 align:middle line:84%
of a stump is covered
with stem cells,

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:24.200 align:middle line:90%
and they call this the blastema.

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens-- when
the stem cells are there

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and start to grow, the voltage
kicks back up to about minus 20

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:33.760 align:middle line:84%
or so, but double
the normal voltage,

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and then the salamander
starts growing a new arm.

00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And then, once it
grows a new arm--

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:44.140 align:middle line:84%
which takes about 60 days-- then
everything goes back to normal.

00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Well an interesting
corollary is you

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.430 align:middle line:84%
take a frog, who's
also an amphibian,

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:50.820 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have that same power.

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:52.990 align:middle line:84%
When you cut off a
frog's leg, it just

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:54.820 align:middle line:90%
ends up with a scarred stump.

00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:58.430 align:middle line:84%
But one of Becker's
residents did that to a frog,

00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:02.260 align:middle line:84%
but embedded a watch battery in
the stump and he grew an arm.

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So voltage.

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: So voltage
is the stimulus that

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:13.260 align:middle line:90%
tells stem cells to activate.

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Now that's both good and bad
because-- we don't have time

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.700 align:middle line:84%
to do it, obviously,
today, but what

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:24.470 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find in another
book that will come out soon

00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:27.840 align:middle line:84%
is that all malignancies
are from stem cells

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and that the stimulus
that makes them activate

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:35.220 align:middle line:84%
is, again, our friend
voltage and the clarity

00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:37.680 align:middle line:90%
of that voltage.

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't normally
do this too much,

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:44.180 align:middle line:84%
but because usually
you're so darn brilliant--

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:47.010 align:middle line:90%
thank you for educating us.

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:50.510 align:middle line:84%
You've also taken the time to
do this in a functional way,

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and you started putting your
own product lines together

00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:55.925 align:middle line:84%
because you are finding
that your patients just

00:53:55.925 --> 00:53:58.200 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to take a
fistful of pills every day,

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's modeled on
the notion of what

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:03.570 align:middle line:84%
is going to create
healthy cells and maintain

00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:05.110 align:middle line:90%
the life of healthy cells.

00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And so you started
putting things together--

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and you touched on this
earlier-- one of the things

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:12.490 align:middle line:84%
that we have to have if we're
having some chronic illness,

00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:16.140 align:middle line:84%
for example, is,
for example, iodine.

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And you put together iodine
in a little bit different way.

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Just tell us about that
because people listening you

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:25.740 align:middle line:84%
may well want to go to your
website and find out what is it

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:27.880 align:middle line:84%
you're giving your
clients and is it working.

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.597 align:middle line:84%
So just give us a
sketch of all that.

00:54:30.597 --> 00:54:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: Sure.

00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:33.388 align:middle line:84%
You remember I told you
that to make new cells,

00:54:33.388 --> 00:54:35.090 align:middle line:90%
you have to have the voltage.

00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:37.360 align:middle line:84%
You have to have everything
it takes to make a cell,

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:39.276 align:middle line:84%
and then you have to
deal with the toxins that

00:54:39.276 --> 00:54:40.660 align:middle line:90%
can damage them.

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:44.320 align:middle line:84%
The voltage piece we
have only just begun,

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.070 align:middle line:84%
but done some of
it, where you have

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:49.890 align:middle line:84%
to figure out why you can't
hold a charge and then fix it.

00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:52.840 align:middle line:84%
For the nutritional
piece, you have

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.800 align:middle line:90%
to have everything it takes.

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:57.112 align:middle line:84%
If a tornado comes through
and blows this building down

00:54:57.112 --> 00:54:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and we have to
build it back but we

00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:00.720 align:middle line:84%
don't have any doors,
windows, or shingles

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.220 align:middle line:90%
it's not a good building.

00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And so it is with cells,
you have to have everything.

00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And to get everything,
I was having

00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:10.220 align:middle line:84%
to have my patients
take 20 pills every day.

00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was frustrated with
those because a lot of them

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:14.610 align:middle line:90%
had toxins in them.

00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:16.693 align:middle line:84%
Like, every tablet contains
magnesium stearate--

00:55:16.693 --> 00:55:17.493 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:55:17.493 --> 00:55:19.360 align:middle line:84%
It's so hard to find
stuff without it.

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: It's-- well, do
I take the toxin because I need

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.180 align:middle line:90%
the substance.

00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:26.430 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was I went
through the physiology books

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:29.160 align:middle line:84%
and I wrote down everything that
cells need that I could find,

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and I went to a
biochemist and said,

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.340 align:middle line:84%
I want to put all of
this in one bucket.

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:40.010 align:middle line:84%
But no preservatives, no
toxins, and everything

00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:41.070 align:middle line:90%
has to be natural.

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And so we came up with a
product that has all of that,

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:47.640 align:middle line:84%
but we couldn't put the iodine
in because the iodine would

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.390 align:middle line:84%
oxidize-- it's
sitting on the shelf--

00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:53.300 align:middle line:84%
but the iodine itself
has B1, iodine, zinc,

00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:59.030 align:middle line:84%
and selenium, and fulvic because
zinc isn't absorbed easily

00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:00.740 align:middle line:90%
without fulvic.

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I have
this system now

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:04.620 align:middle line:84%
that takes care of
the nutrition piece.

00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you do the whole system--
not just a piece of it--

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:10.890 align:middle line:84%
do the whole system, then
we've-- then all we have

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:13.170 align:middle line:84%
to think about is
voltage and toxins.

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:15.860 align:middle line:84%
So toxins-- we know
there are some ways

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:18.990 align:middle line:84%
to start chelating
them out of our body,

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:20.610 align:middle line:90%
and some of the heavy metals.

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Chelation
is not a great way

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:22.514 align:middle line:90%
to do it, by the way.

00:56:22.514 --> 00:56:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I'm just saying
that in a casual way, OK?

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.720 align:middle line:90%
Casual way.

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Natural ways of chelating the
stuff out, dragging the toxins

00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:32.530 align:middle line:90%
out of the body.

00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's just go to the other
part, which is the voltage part.

00:56:36.570 --> 00:56:39.950 align:middle line:84%
How important is it
to move our muscles?

00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: Well that's
one of the basic ways we're

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:45.660 align:middle line:84%
designed to recharge our
personal battery pack

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:46.990 align:middle line:90%
is to move.

00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:50.610 align:middle line:84%
So exercise is not just
to get your lymphatics

00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:54.530 align:middle line:84%
moving, which it does, but
perhaps the most important

00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:57.570 align:middle line:84%
thing exercise does is it
recharges your personal battery

00:56:57.570 --> 00:56:59.280 align:middle line:90%
pack.

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So--
and we need water.

00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:02.430 align:middle line:84%
All batteries have
to have fluid.

00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: And minerals.

00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:04.744 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We need
nutrients, which--

00:57:04.744 --> 00:57:06.660 align:middle line:84%
the product you're talking
about, for example,

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:10.030 align:middle line:84%
have all these nutrients,
and minerals, and such in it.

00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And then we need to, then,
detox the body of heavy metals

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and the things that are
impacting our voltage, right?

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:18.487 align:middle line:90%
Pretty much it?

00:57:18.487 --> 00:57:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. TENNANT: Yeah.

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:22.610 align:middle line:90%
But basic is always voltage.

00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:24.880 align:middle line:10%
You have to fix the
voltage, and that should not

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.662 align:middle line:10%
surprise if you think about it.

00:57:26.662 --> 00:57:28.120 align:middle line:10%
When we say the
word voltage, we're

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:32.240 align:middle line:10%
talking about energy that is
stored and available to do

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.240 align:middle line:10%
something.

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So obviously everything in
the universe is about energy,

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and the difference between
being dead and alive

00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:42.610 align:middle line:84%
is, guess what, is there
voltage in your body.

00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is there
any voltage, right.

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. TENNANT: The way
we know you're dead

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:47.143 align:middle line:84%
is we hook electrodes
up and there's

00:57:47.143 --> 00:57:49.476 align:middle line:84%
no brainwaves left, which
means there's no voltage left.

00:57:49.476 --> 00:57:50.559 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No voltage left.

00:57:50.559 --> 00:57:51.800 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:52.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's taken a
while to get you here

00:57:54.450 --> 00:57:57.680 align:middle line:84%
because you're a busy man, you
actually work for a living.

00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:59.120 align:middle line:90%
You're not just an author.

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps when
the new book's out,

00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:04.360 align:middle line:84%
we'll have you back around in
another six months or a year

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:05.200 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.491 align:middle line:84%
