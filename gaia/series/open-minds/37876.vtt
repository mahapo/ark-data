>> Regina Meredith: This
story takes us on a wild ride.

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:34.334 align:middle line:84%
It's about a man who experienced
a rare kundalini awakening

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:37.804 align:middle line:84%
and decided he wanted to spend
the rest of his life meditating,

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.739 align:middle line:84%
to do that, he needed
enough money

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.575 align:middle line:90%
to take the rest of his life of.

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:44.711 align:middle line:84%
Understanding focus, awareness
he made millions of dollars

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:48.048 align:middle line:84%
out of nothing which bought his
freedom to live as he wished.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:51.218 align:middle line:84%
From seminary school to
Asian bordellos to true love,

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:54.488 align:middle line:84%
Marty Birrittella created
a life many only dream off

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:58.558 align:middle line:84%
to what he says is just
listening and it is.

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.193 align:middle line:90%
I love this book.

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:01.862 align:middle line:84%
You know how we love just
kind of peeping it on,

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:03.462 align:middle line:84%
on other people's
live sometimes.

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:06.600 align:middle line:84%
That's what it's like because
this is-- this is bare.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.868 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin Birrittella: Yeah.

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:10.036 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You don't-- you
have no gale in the book.

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:11.471 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing held back.

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:13.874 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're
trying to position yourself

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:15.842 align:middle line:90%
as an angel or a saint.

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:19.212 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the same time you
have had a chance to rise

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:22.716 align:middle line:84%
up into this incredibly
angelic experience as a result

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:24.618 align:middle line:90%
of the path of listening.

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:26.153 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, before
we get going yesterday--

00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:27.487 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: OK.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.656 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- we were-- we
shared a cabin from the airport

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:31.424 align:middle line:90%
as we came in at the same time.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:35.362 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, you
and the driver, Rob--

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:37.696 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: His brother, I played
football with in high school.

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:38.765 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: We took
the same high school.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And it was like
listening to this little slice

00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:43.069 align:middle line:84%
of what I read in your
book about this life

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.204 align:middle line:90%
and Tarrytown New York.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:45.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Right.

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:46.172 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Your families
were intertwined,

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.641 align:middle line:90%
your family's bread business,

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:49.743 align:middle line:84%
he knew the bread
'cause his family was

00:01:49.743 --> 00:01:50.976 align:middle line:90%
in the restaurant business and--

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:52.312 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:54.748 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It was like a slice
of life from a certain era

00:01:54.748 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
in New York that only
you two could relate to.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.885 align:middle line:90%
I was just the observer.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:00.187 align:middle line:84%
It was really sweet
to listen to.

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:01.354 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: I was--
it was amazing.

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:02.722 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:05.192 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, let's talk about
your life in Tarrytown just

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:84%
to set the stage
for what happen,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.564 align:middle line:84%
because you're an
unlikely person to be--

00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:12.399 align:middle line:90%
well your background is unlikely

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:14.668 align:middle line:84%
to be one who'd be spending
six hour a day meditating.

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:16.503 align:middle line:84%
Today, but who's is, right,
if you're in the west.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:17.037 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Right.

00:02:17.037 --> 00:02:17.571 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:18.705 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:20.173 align:middle line:84%
Well, the funny thing is
in this town, I grow up

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:22.709 align:middle line:84%
and in my family
there were seven boys.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.011 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's name began with
an Ms. My mother had seven

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:31.017 align:middle line:84%
cesareans and she was
very, I wouldn't say wild

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:32.786 align:middle line:90%
but she was very strict.

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:34.921 align:middle line:84%
Obviously everybody in
the town knew who we were,

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:36.690 align:middle line:84%
picture was in the
paper a lot and on top

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.525 align:middle line:90%
of that my dad has this baker

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:41.927 align:middle line:84%
where everybody buys our
Italian bread all the time.

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:46.466 align:middle line:84%
And it was just an
amazing place.

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.401 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful place to
live and grow up there.

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:51.438 align:middle line:84%
And me being the second the son,
the oldest was is going to go

00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:54.040 align:middle line:84%
into the bakery business but
I was like, "what could I do

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.377 align:middle line:90%
and my dream in a-- probably

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:59.946 align:middle line:84%
at that time I was seven years
old is I wanted to be a priest.

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:03.450 align:middle line:84%
My aunt, my mother's sister
was a nun and I would go

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.751 align:middle line:90%
down to a convent and see that.

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:06.119 align:middle line:84%
My mother love to
church so much.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.188 align:middle line:84%
We have big rosaries
hanging in the house.

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.724 align:middle line:84%
And I just loved
everything about the church.

00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:12.525 align:middle line:84%
It was like, I remember
announcing

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.394 align:middle line:84%
to my second grade teacher,
I am going to be a priest

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:16.162 align:middle line:84%
and by the time I
was 14 years old,

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:18.498 align:middle line:84%
I went to the junior
seminary to be a priest.

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:21.134 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, that part of you
was already kicked in by birth.

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:23.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean you came in
already wired toward--

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.903 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Right.

00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:26.439 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- wanting to
experience something of a--

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.975 align:middle line:84%
a more ethereal or
exalted nature.

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:30.343 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Right,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:31.611 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:32.946 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: I mean I always
like to say, I fantasized

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:34.514 align:middle line:84%
when I was a little kid maybe
9 or 10 years old sitting

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:37.117 align:middle line:84%
in the church and probably
watching Robin Hood or something

00:03:37.117 --> 00:03:39.986 align:middle line:84%
on TV, I would imagine
myself swing from the balcony

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.322 align:middle line:84%
and saving the priest
because the robbers came

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:43.623 align:middle line:90%
on to the stage or something.

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:46.326 align:middle line:84%
So, I had this fantasy going
out on my mind, you know,

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:48.962 align:middle line:84%
there was sort of--
romantic quality to it

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:52.132 align:middle line:84%
at the same time but, you know,
sure enough when I was 14,

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:55.068 align:middle line:84%
you know, I ended up going
away to a Carmelite seminary

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:58.638 align:middle line:84%
with just 50 kids in it away,
full time, you know, very,

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:00.173 align:middle line:90%
very strict situation.

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:01.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Oh you must have
made your mother very proud.

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:03.243 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Oh she was so happy.

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:06.579 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: When I was
seven or eight years old.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.982 align:middle line:84%
I had dreams of becoming a
nun but I was a Lutheran--

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.418 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- so I didn't really
understand what was involved

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.052 align:middle line:84%
and after practicing
with my girlfriend,

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:14.788 align:middle line:84%
all the things Catholics
are supposed to do,

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:17.991 align:middle line:84%
I realized it was a lot of
work and I bailed a lot sooner

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:20.160 align:middle line:84%
on that dream of
life that you did.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.994 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:21.795 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: So, seminary school.

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:22.829 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:24.965 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Well, it
was-- I loved it.

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was very difficult
'cause I was going

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.969 align:middle line:84%
through puberty at
the same time.

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:30.637 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
wild things, you know,

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:32.272 align:middle line:84%
without getting into it,
there's a lot of wild things

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.475 align:middle line:84%
that are going on there
because we would go

00:04:35.475 --> 00:04:39.713 align:middle line:84%
to mass every single morning
and you can't have any sins.

00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:41.314 align:middle line:90%
You have to go to confession.

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:42.781 align:middle line:84%
I mean literally
to be with a priest

00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:44.351 align:middle line:90%
in the confession every morning.

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:45.852 align:middle line:84%
When he wasn't there,
I have to go

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:48.154 align:middle line:84%
down of my dorm,
knock on his door.

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:49.222 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:49.889 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Were you
there every morning?

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:50.724 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Well, no.

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:53.326 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't there every morning,

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:54.928 align:middle line:84%
but I tell you it's a
little traumatic just going

00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:56.963 align:middle line:84%
down there a couple of times
and not knocking on the door

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.099 align:middle line:84%
and say, "Father, can you
hear my confession and kneel

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.102 align:middle line:84%
down next to a bed of
a priest, you know.

00:05:02.102 --> 00:05:03.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Especially
with today's connotation.

00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:06.573 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Yeah, with
today's connotation with that,

00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:07.941 align:middle line:90%
specifically that's not--

00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:10.744 align:middle line:84%
wasn't happening but I did have
a guy end up falling in love

00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:13.246 align:middle line:84%
with me and the reason I
didn't go back to the seminary

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:16.716 align:middle line:84%
in my second year because
he had sent me a love letter

00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:18.385 align:middle line:90%
and my mother intercepted it

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:20.754 align:middle line:84%
and when my mother saw
that, she goes, that's it.

00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:23.289 align:middle line:84%
No, you cannot go back to
the seminary so I wouldn't--

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.692 align:middle line:84%
right from my freshmen
year in high school right

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:29.429 align:middle line:84%
into my Sleepy Hollow High
School which was in Tarrytown

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:32.265 align:middle line:84%
and I knew all the
kids there already.

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:33.666 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Football, do you.

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:36.202 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Football, I was the
president of the junior class.

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:38.638 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it was like,
I sort of had a normal life

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:41.808 align:middle line:84%
from that point forward but I
internally, there was a part

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:43.943 align:middle line:84%
of me 'cause I was crying
and crying, you know,

00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:45.345 align:middle line:84%
when I couldn't go
back to the seminary,

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.280 align:middle line:90%
I really wanted to do that.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.281 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: So divisional--

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:49.949 align:middle line:84%
to be devoted to
something was really--

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:50.884 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Oh yeah, it was--

00:05:50.884 --> 00:05:52.118 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- high
wired into you.

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: It was high
wired into me and, you know,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.221 align:middle line:90%
I did really well in schools.

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:57.557 align:middle line:84%
I end up going to Cornell
Engineering School.

00:05:57.557 --> 00:05:59.826 align:middle line:84%
When I was at Cornell,
I only really--

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:03.129 align:middle line:84%
I lasted there for one year
because one of the things that I

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:07.000 align:middle line:84%
like to say is that-- besides
everything being a field

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.602 align:middle line:84%
of love, my experience,
everything is a field of love

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:11.304 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
just movement.

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:15.608 align:middle line:84%
And one day I was standing
at this war protest in front

00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:18.878 align:middle line:84%
of this famous building,
Willard Straight Hall at Cornell

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:22.015 align:middle line:84%
and there was a march
over to the--

00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:24.384 align:middle line:84%
they were protesting [inaudible]
and some of the things

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:25.819 align:middle line:84%
that are going on
at the university.

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:28.555 align:middle line:84%
I ran into this building where
these people and they took

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:30.557 align:middle line:90%
over this building and--

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.058 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: You spontaneously--

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:33.259 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: I just
spontaneously--

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.128 align:middle line:84%
it's like something inside
of me just said, move,

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:37.330 align:middle line:84%
go in this building and
instantly they're chaining

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:84%
up the doors and
wallpapering everything.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:84%
There was just crazy
takeover and, you know,

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.040 align:middle line:84%
within a few hours or 30,
riot polices coming down

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.309 align:middle line:84%
and breaking the windows,
they're coming in,

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:51.611 align:middle line:84%
but what happened was
since the president

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:54.314 align:middle line:84%
of the university wasn't there,
we ended up holding on to

00:06:54.314 --> 00:06:57.417 align:middle line:84%
that building for--
for a whole week.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:58.351 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That made the news.

00:06:58.351 --> 00:06:59.552 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: That made the news.

00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:01.354 align:middle line:84%
I was on news, and they
came to us and they said--

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:04.624 align:middle line:84%
Attica, amount people or
listeners know what Attica was

00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:07.427 align:middle line:84%
but that was like maybe 9
months before that they sent

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:08.795 align:middle line:90%
in 500 state troopers.

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:12.298 align:middle line:84%
A lot of inmates got killed
there so they just said to us.

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:14.667 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you either out
of this building by Friday,

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:16.169 align:middle line:84%
if you're not we're sending
all these state troopers

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:17.437 align:middle line:90%
down here, so were smart enough.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.239 align:middle line:84%
Even though they--
they held tripods set

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:22.408 align:middle line:84%
up across the street taking
photographs of everybody.

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:24.611 align:middle line:84%
And instead of getting
kicked out of school

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:29.582 align:middle line:84%
which many people did, I just
left and dropped out of Cornell

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:30.683 align:middle line:90%
and I went to work

00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:32.285 align:middle line:84%
as a construction worker
in Albany, New York.

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.187 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But that's where
it really gets interesting.

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:35.021 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:36.322 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Let me just go back.

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:39.858 align:middle line:84%
For a moment, my mind has
always wondered about this.

00:07:39.858 --> 00:07:43.229 align:middle line:84%
You put a bunch of young
pubescent boys together,

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:45.899 align:middle line:84%
sequestered, cloistered,
no girls,

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:49.102 align:middle line:84%
you can't have any interaction
with girls, how's a system

00:07:49.102 --> 00:07:51.204 align:middle line:90%
like that ever going to work?

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:53.206 align:middle line:90%
I mean that just doesn't work.

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Well, I don't
know if that's true.

00:07:54.406 --> 00:07:56.242 align:middle line:84%
I mean you can see like
in this Buddha's monastery

00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:59.178 align:middle line:84%
in the far east going to
Thailand and Indonesia

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:01.614 align:middle line:84%
and places like there's like,
you know, hundred and hundreds

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:02.815 align:middle line:90%
so that can totally work.

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:04.717 align:middle line:84%
I just think it's--
it totally can work.

00:08:04.717 --> 00:08:06.052 align:middle line:84%
It's totally the
mindset of that.

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:08.354 align:middle line:84%
It's just that, you know,
I'm hearing like everybody is

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:10.089 align:middle line:84%
down in the basement,
sniffing glue

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:11.291 align:middle line:84%
in mattresses and
stuff like that.

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:13.927 align:middle line:84%
That's what's going on,
besides other activities.

00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:15.028 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:16.262 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: You know,
but it's like, you know,

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:17.697 align:middle line:90%
it is what it-- what are.

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:19.432 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I mean, do
you think that's a--

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:23.169 align:middle line:90%
do you think in general that's--

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.071 align:middle line:84%
well, I guess it's highly
individualized as to

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:26.773 align:middle line:84%
who that's going to work
for but it just seems

00:08:26.773 --> 00:08:28.608 align:middle line:84%
like it's a little
out of balance.

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:30.143 align:middle line:84%
And you know, a lot
of people think,

00:08:30.143 --> 00:08:32.712 align:middle line:84%
get the distractions away,
separate the boys and girls

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:35.315 align:middle line:84%
so they can concentrate
on their studies and such

00:08:35.315 --> 00:08:38.551 align:middle line:84%
but that's a really pivotal
period of life to be able

00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:40.320 align:middle line:90%
to start figuring things out.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Well, yeah--

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.555 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: The integration
could be--

00:08:42.555 --> 00:08:44.591 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: I understand
but like, reading my book.

00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:46.726 align:middle line:84%
As you see there's like
the whole sexual thing

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:49.562 align:middle line:84%
of what was going on within that
was very prevalent, starting.

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:51.197 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that made
the biggest impact to me

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.765 align:middle line:84%
when I was a little
kid, you know,

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:55.235 align:middle line:84%
my brother was outside playing,
you know, nurse and doctor

00:08:55.235 --> 00:08:57.904 align:middle line:84%
and I was just a witness to
that and my mother got our hands

00:08:57.904 --> 00:08:59.339 align:middle line:84%
on us and she's like,
came upstairs

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:01.741 align:middle line:84%
and I actually have a
title, one of the chapters,

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.710 align:middle line:84%
so I'll cut it off,
you know, it was like--

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:84%
and that was like imprinted
in my brain and my psyche,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.715 align:middle line:90%
you know, all the way through.

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:09.749 align:middle line:84%
It's like all the
way growing up.

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:12.752 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Bad image
to have implanted.

00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:13.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Right, right, so.

00:09:13.453 --> 00:09:14.721 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:16.255 align:middle line:84%
I was just wondering about
that because it just seems

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:19.559 align:middle line:90%
like private schools with boys

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.795 align:middle line:84%
and girls separated
produce interesting people.

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:25.398 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's a lot of kind of
corkiness oftentimes in a mix.

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.032 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: It could be.

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:27.400 align:middle line:90%
It could be.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.534 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So I just thought
I'd ask anyway or I can move on.

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:30.703 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, now you're
working construction.

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:32.071 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: I'm working
construction.

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:33.506 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you're living
in a little basement somewhere?

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:34.874 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Yeah, a
guy picked me up,

00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:36.876 align:middle line:84%
hitchhiked in the New York state
for a while, he let me lived

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:38.511 align:middle line:84%
in his garden apartment
basement next

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:41.781 align:middle line:84%
to the Albany Medical Center
and I was living down there.

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:44.017 align:middle line:84%
So in the winter time
everybody got laid off

00:09:44.017 --> 00:09:46.052 align:middle line:84%
for building the new
capital of New York State,

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:47.887 align:middle line:90%
they call it Rockefeller's tomb.

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:49.889 align:middle line:84%
There was like 3000
construction workers on the site

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:53.426 align:middle line:84%
but in the winter time they
had to lay everybody off.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:56.029 align:middle line:84%
So it was just something
that came to me.

00:09:56.029 --> 00:09:59.565 align:middle line:84%
I was like, for some reason I
just started doing hatha yoga,

00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:02.835 align:middle line:84%
you know, real crazy, real
intensely a couple of hours--

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You and your
construction worker buddies?

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.606 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: No, no, just me
and myself, just me and--

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I kind of got that.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.808 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:10.243 align:middle line:84%
In a basement with a
little furnace next to me,

00:10:10.243 --> 00:10:14.447 align:middle line:84%
and you know, within six weeks
after doing that, one night--

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:17.784 align:middle line:84%
after meditating and I was
lying in the savasana pose

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:20.953 align:middle line:84%
like the corpse pose in my back
and immediately I end up going

00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and seeing this vision of
myself driving in a car

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.460 align:middle line:84%
as a my brother's red
Camaro, red SS3 50 Camaro,

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.761 align:middle line:90%
people know what that car is,

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:30.563 align:middle line:84%
it's really, hard
car that he had.

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:33.066 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, police then pulls me
over, I'm sitting my girlfriend,

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:37.136 align:middle line:84%
he walks up to the car,
pulls out his revolver,

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:40.039 align:middle line:84%
points at right up my face and
shoots and everything boom,

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:41.441 align:middle line:84%
at that moment goes
in slow motion.

00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:44.777 align:middle line:84%
I just watched the bullet come
hit me right in my third eye.

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:48.114 align:middle line:84%
Just it blows my head off
my awareness is still there,

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:51.284 align:middle line:84%
so I'm sitting now within
the back sit of the car

00:10:51.284 --> 00:10:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and there's presence,
there's voice comes

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.089 align:middle line:84%
to me saying you have 5
seconds so let's say good bye

00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:57.824 align:middle line:84%
to who you want to
say good bye to.

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:00.593 align:middle line:84%
So the person I wanted to
say good bye to was my mother

00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:03.362 align:middle line:84%
and my high school girlfriend,
Cynthia [assumed spelling].

00:11:03.362 --> 00:11:07.333 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I say good bye to
them I was instantly transported

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:12.405 align:middle line:84%
into this field of blue
purple light that was the love

00:11:12.405 --> 00:11:17.343 align:middle line:84%
and the light and that thing was
so overwhelming I was just like,

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:18.811 align:middle line:84%
even just thinking
about it right now,

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:20.413 align:middle line:90%
it has an affect in me.

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:26.519 align:middle line:84%
And I was in that light, as I
was in that light, I look down

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:29.021 align:middle line:84%
and I could see myself lying on
the floor, so I was completely

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:32.959 align:middle line:84%
out of my body and I knew from
that moment, I was like, "Hey,

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:36.095 align:middle line:84%
I am-- I totally am not
in my body and that sort

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:38.765 align:middle line:84%
of catapulted me into like,
"Well, I would only want to,

00:11:38.765 --> 00:11:41.134 align:middle line:84%
you know, explore
this whole yoga thing

00:11:41.134 --> 00:11:42.702 align:middle line:90%
because this really work.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:45.338 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm reading,
Yogananda's book, "Autobiography

00:11:45.338 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:84%
of Yogi" and then
within twelve months,

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.942 align:middle line:84%
I'm living down in
Gainesville, Florida.

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:52.545 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What was the
significance of giving you

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:54.046 align:middle line:90%
that ultimatum and telling you,

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:84%
you had to say goodbye
to two people?

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.919 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Yeah, well, I mean
it took me a number of years

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:03.189 align:middle line:84%
to figure that out
because I really--

00:12:03.189 --> 00:12:06.292 align:middle line:84%
there was this really strong
attachment to the mother

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:08.327 align:middle line:84%
and my girlfriend,
to the female,

00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:11.998 align:middle line:84%
and to sort of transcend,
I think it was on internal,

00:12:11.998 --> 00:12:14.700 align:middle line:84%
the manifestation of that
experience was saying to me,

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.203 align:middle line:84%
"Hey, you want to go into a like
a higher set of consciousness,

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:19.672 align:middle line:84%
you have to let go with the
feminine and that just fit

00:12:19.672 --> 00:12:22.775 align:middle line:84%
in to my whole seminary thing
and what's going on with that.

00:12:22.775 --> 00:12:24.877 align:middle line:90%
Again, I'm totally supportive

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:27.914 align:middle line:84%
with that whole belief system
happened to be, it's like bingo,

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:29.248 align:middle line:84%
you know, that's
it, and I was like,

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:31.818 align:middle line:84%
I'm down in Florida
going like, "Oh yeah,

00:12:31.818 --> 00:12:33.186 align:middle line:90%
this is what I want to do."

00:12:33.186 --> 00:12:35.288 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So the feminine was
a distraction on your level.

00:12:35.288 --> 00:12:37.156 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Yeah, it
was a distraction.

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:38.891 align:middle line:84%
And you can see, you know,
I always talk about like

00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:42.395 align:middle line:84%
in most religious in
societies whether it's Islam

00:12:42.395 --> 00:12:44.897 align:middle line:84%
or Christianity or whatever,
there's a lot of like, man,

00:12:44.897 --> 00:12:47.400 align:middle line:84%
we just have to transcend
the whole sexual thing now.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.604 align:middle line:84%
You know that thing was like
going on inside of me so one

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:54.140 align:middle line:84%
of the things that I did do
when I got down to Florida,

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I started doing-- I
started meditating really

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.378 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:01.714 align:middle line:90%
And I became celibate.

00:13:01.714 --> 00:13:03.416 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, I want
to become celibate

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:06.352 align:middle line:84%
because maybe this will have
something to do with putting me

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:09.121 align:middle line:90%
into an altered state.

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:13.159 align:middle line:84%
From there, it didn't really
take very much time before I,

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:15.027 align:middle line:84%
you know, had my head
blown off so to speak.

00:13:15.027 --> 00:13:17.563 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Right and you were--
that was about six months in?

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:18.431 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:19.465 align:middle line:84%
That was about I
was down there--

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:20.833 align:middle line:84%
I was down there and
I was meditating,

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:24.637 align:middle line:84%
I was doing yogananda, so I
have self-realizations lessons

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.606 align:middle line:84%
because like the guys I
was living with where--

00:13:26.606 --> 00:13:29.175 align:middle line:84%
having doing it for a year
and every Sunday we go

00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:32.712 align:middle line:84%
out this Mickey Singer who--
Michael Singer who's the author

00:13:32.712 --> 00:13:35.882 align:middle line:84%
of this book that's come up
recently, "Untethered Soul."

00:13:35.882 --> 00:13:37.049 align:middle line:90%
And we-- Mickey was probably

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:38.417 align:middle line:84%
like in his twenties
at that time.

00:13:38.417 --> 00:13:41.153 align:middle line:84%
We're all meditating there,
whatever, but I was just jealous

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:45.124 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to-- they
were like a year ahead of me,

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:47.627 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's like I wanted
to catch, I wanted to catch up.

00:13:47.627 --> 00:13:52.531 align:middle line:84%
So I went into this book store
of course in the University

00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:54.100 align:middle line:84%
of Florida and I
bought this book,

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.836 align:middle line:84%
the title of the book was a
Macmillan Book was called Guru.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:14:00.206 align:middle line:84%
I go, "This is interesting so
I picked it up, took it home

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:04.777 align:middle line:84%
and I read that book on a
Saturday morning and it was all

00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:07.780 align:middle line:84%
about this guy Muktananda
and his experiences

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.583 align:middle line:84%
with his guru whose
name was Nityananda.

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:13.886 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a detail,
such personal detail

00:14:13.886 --> 00:14:17.189 align:middle line:84%
of all the exercises and
the mantras and he used

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:19.525 align:middle line:84%
and different worlds and
states that he went into

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:22.995 align:middle line:84%
and I was just like, I couldn't
believe the guy was saying what

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:25.831 align:middle line:84%
the mantra was because the
yoga that I was doing sacred.

00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:26.933 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Right,
you're not supposed to--

00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:28.267 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: I said, I'm
not supposed to know

00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:31.304 align:middle line:84%
like he's saying this mantras
but anyway, after reading

00:14:31.304 --> 00:14:35.841 align:middle line:84%
that book, I was so charged,
you know, that, you know,

00:14:35.841 --> 00:14:37.276 align:middle line:84%
I was literally bouncing
off the wall,

00:14:37.276 --> 00:14:38.477 align:middle line:84%
the expression you're
bouncing off the wall.

00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:39.679 align:middle line:84%
It was like bouncing
off the wall.

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:42.214 align:middle line:84%
So I have my little altar
set up so I sat down.

00:14:42.214 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:84%
I mediate, I could
have mediated but I was

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.651 align:middle line:90%
like almost like shaking.

00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Got up, went outside,
went for a long walk

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.188 align:middle line:90%
and back again, sat down again.

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:50.756 align:middle line:84%
There's so much energy
in my body.

00:14:50.756 --> 00:14:52.391 align:middle line:90%
I just couldn't take it.

00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:54.627 align:middle line:90%
I-- so it finally relaxed me.

00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:58.197 align:middle line:84%
I went into the kitchen and
I drank like a half a gallon

00:14:58.197 --> 00:15:00.433 align:middle line:84%
of milk and like five
peanut butter sandwiches,

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:01.567 align:middle line:90%
that's the only thing--

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.135 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Anchor you
until it backing down.

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:04.103 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Just calm me down.

00:15:04.103 --> 00:15:05.204 align:middle line:90%
Just to calm me down.

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:06.572 align:middle line:84%
And then I was like,
I'm not going to go back

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:09.308 align:middle line:84%
and to meditate, I'm just going
to, just go sit on the couch

00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:12.178 align:middle line:84%
so I have to digest, you know,
I'm just like, OK, now I'm like.

00:15:12.178 --> 00:15:16.382 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting, yeah,
I'm sitting on this couch

00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:20.619 align:middle line:84%
and as I'm sitting on this
couch, over the next two

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:25.291 align:middle line:84%
and a half hours, I go
into this unbelievable,

00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:28.594 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini experience where
initially my feet start

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:32.231 align:middle line:84%
to heat up, really, really hot
and this heat spreads up my legs

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:35.134 align:middle line:84%
and I lose all sensation
from my like my knees down

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:38.671 align:middle line:84%
and finally this energy, you
know, comes up to the my waist,

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:42.041 align:middle line:84%
lose all feeling and then
I'm hearing the mantra

00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:44.977 align:middle line:84%
that Muktananda used with
Nityananda which was guru om.

00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:45.978 align:middle line:90%
I start hearing the mantra.

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:47.279 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Guru oma.

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:50.116 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Guru om, guru om,
hearing this mantra going

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:51.117 align:middle line:90%
out of my head, I'm going,

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.418 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of fascinated
at this point.

00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:53.219 align:middle line:90%
I was like, "Whoa!"

00:15:53.219 --> 00:15:54.220 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what's going on.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.021 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: What's happening?

00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:55.888 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: What's happening?

00:15:55.888 --> 00:15:57.089 align:middle line:84%
I was like I had
no expectations.

00:15:57.089 --> 00:15:59.291 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
was going to happen.

00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:01.427 align:middle line:84%
And then at the very
base of my spine,

00:16:01.427 --> 00:16:04.363 align:middle line:84%
I could just feel this
contraction and upward po--

00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:08.100 align:middle line:84%
whenever I heard guru and when
I've relaxed om would come out

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.469 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden,
this is the craziest,

00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:12.938 align:middle line:84%
one of the craziest parts
I was literally breathing

00:16:12.938 --> 00:16:14.473 align:middle line:90%
in my left nostril.

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:15.775 align:middle line:90%
I'm breathing out my right--

00:16:15.775 --> 00:16:16.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Without
covering them.

00:16:16.942 --> 00:16:18.344 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Without
doing anything.

00:16:18.344 --> 00:16:20.312 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I said I was going
like, you know, I put my hand

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:22.248 align:middle line:84%
up to my mouth and going
like, "Wow, what is this?"

00:16:22.248 --> 00:16:25.818 align:middle line:84%
And then this energy started
every little bit was just go a

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:28.921 align:middle line:84%
little bit of my body up
and down, up and down.

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:31.257 align:middle line:90%
It was incredibly sexual.

00:16:31.257 --> 00:16:33.626 align:middle line:84%
It felt like this
energy was inside of me

00:16:33.626 --> 00:16:35.194 align:middle line:90%
and it was having sex with me

00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:36.595 align:middle line:84%
and I was just sitting
there, watching it.

00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:39.364 align:middle line:84%
It's probably like took maybe
an hour, 45 minutes to an hour,

00:16:39.364 --> 00:16:42.101 align:middle line:84%
every-- breathe in,
breathe out, in and out,

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and finally the energy
made it to my chest.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:48.941 align:middle line:84%
When it hit my chest, it was
like the room was blew apart

00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:53.579 align:middle line:84%
with love, love that I
had never, ever even.

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:55.181 align:middle line:84%
I mean the thought
was like, "Oh my God.

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:56.515 align:middle line:90%
This is what love is."

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:58.617 align:middle line:84%
You know, you would hear the
terminology love, this was--

00:16:58.617 --> 00:17:00.419 align:middle line:84%
my heart was-- and I
thought that was the end

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:04.856 align:middle line:84%
of the experience but what
happen was, after I calm down,

00:17:04.856 --> 00:17:08.127 align:middle line:84%
of about 15 minutes, and one
time the New York Times came

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:10.329 align:middle line:84%
to ask me-- the New York
Times reporter asked me

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.097 align:middle line:84%
about this experience
and somehow I said,

00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:14.533 align:middle line:84%
I sounded like I got shot
in the heart with heroine,

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:16.035 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
that feels like

00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:18.170 align:middle line:84%
but that was what the
description was like really sort

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.974 align:middle line:84%
of overwhelming, and
then the sensation.

00:17:21.974 --> 00:17:23.109 align:middle line:90%
The breathing started again

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:24.710 align:middle line:84%
and the energy got
higher, it hits my throat.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.479 align:middle line:84%
It another half an
hour to get up there,

00:17:26.479 --> 00:17:29.048 align:middle line:84%
all feeling from that
whatever went from there

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:30.416 align:middle line:90%
down was completely dead.

00:17:30.416 --> 00:17:32.284 align:middle line:84%
Although my eyes were
open, I was looking around.

00:17:32.284 --> 00:17:35.521 align:middle line:84%
I hit my throat and the way
I like to describe that is

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:37.857 align:middle line:84%
if you go into a hall of
mirrors out in amusement park

00:17:37.857 --> 00:17:40.426 align:middle line:84%
and you see yourself
in every single mirror,

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:43.229 align:middle line:84%
it's like I was basically
just everything was one,

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:45.798 align:middle line:84%
I was everything in the room
and I thought that was the end

00:17:45.798 --> 00:17:48.467 align:middle line:84%
of the experience but no,
you know, and that took

00:17:48.467 --> 00:17:50.803 align:middle line:84%
like an another half an hour
and the energy start to break

00:17:50.803 --> 00:17:52.838 align:middle line:84%
through the roof of my mouth, it
felt like someone just pressing

00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:57.910 align:middle line:84%
on my palate and my eyes became
very focus and my third eye

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.713 align:middle line:84%
and then my eyes rolled up
in my head and I was looking

00:18:00.713 --> 00:18:04.884 align:middle line:84%
up into this field of light
and was like, so ecstatic,

00:18:04.884 --> 00:18:09.054 align:middle line:84%
every breath was like some
sort of fume of light,

00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:10.756 align:middle line:84%
ecstasy was getting
higher and higher

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:12.525 align:middle line:90%
like you're approaching orgasm,

00:18:12.525 --> 00:18:15.060 align:middle line:84%
that's really exactly
what the sensation like.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.428 align:middle line:84%
You got higher and higher
and then all of a sudden--

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:19.298 align:middle line:84%
the only way I describe
it as if the roof

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:25.137 align:middle line:84%
of the house is blown off in a
million volts of light and love,

00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:29.441 align:middle line:84%
hit the roof of my head and just
like went through my whole body

00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and every single pore in my body
was organisming at one time.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.882 align:middle line:84%
The electricity and
the sensation

00:18:36.882 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:90%
of that is really indescribable.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:42.254 align:middle line:84%
I was probably into it for five
seconds, five to ten seconds

00:18:42.254 --> 00:18:46.458 align:middle line:84%
and the thought came, "Oh my
God, I'm leaving my body."

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:50.829 align:middle line:84%
And with that incredible
fear and a part

00:18:50.829 --> 00:18:53.866 align:middle line:84%
of me willfully even though I
had loss all sensation threw

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:58.637 align:middle line:84%
myself off the couch onto
the floor and my head--

00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:02.074 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I hit the coffee
table but I was like lying

00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:03.976 align:middle line:90%
on the floor, pounding, pounding

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:05.377 align:middle line:84%
and the thought that
comes to me.

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:08.847 align:middle line:84%
If this is yoga, I don't want
to have anything to do with it.

00:19:08.847 --> 00:19:10.282 align:middle line:90%
This will kill you.

00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:11.884 align:middle line:90%
This will kill you.

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:13.519 align:middle line:90%
So I was like stunned.

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I was like so totally
gone and over like a 2

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.924 align:middle line:90%
and a half hour period time.

00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:21.927 align:middle line:84%
That's what happened and I
would not mediate after that.

00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:22.862 align:middle line:90%
I would not mediate.

00:19:22.862 --> 00:19:25.798 align:middle line:90%
It took me four to six weeks.

00:19:25.798 --> 00:19:27.132 align:middle line:90%
I refused.

00:19:27.132 --> 00:19:30.336 align:middle line:84%
I mean I looked at ought through
the head with a yogananda

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:32.171 align:middle line:84%
and Jesus and the other
guru is like, "Hey, man,

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:34.073 align:middle line:90%
you guys, take a vacation.

00:19:34.073 --> 00:19:36.242 align:middle line:84%
Nothing-- nothing's getting
in front of you, you know?

00:19:36.242 --> 00:19:38.143 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, because
it was so completely

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:39.545 align:middle line:90%
out of your control as well.

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:41.413 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Oh yeah, I was
like this whole force is so--

00:19:41.413 --> 00:19:43.816 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe that
the power could be that.

00:19:43.816 --> 00:19:45.317 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the reason
I put power in the title,

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:48.520 align:middle line:84%
really talking about this
force which is oh is there,

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.555 align:middle line:90%
it's always movement,

00:19:49.555 --> 00:19:51.290 align:middle line:84%
it's always movement
that's happening,

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.992 align:middle line:84%
it's always accessible,
we just have

00:19:52.992 --> 00:19:55.127 align:middle line:84%
to open ourselves
to receiving it.

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:56.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, they just tell
me, sure people are saying,

00:19:56.562 --> 00:19:57.696 align:middle line:90%
what was that guru om.

00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:59.899 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Guru-- well,
I put that in my book.

00:19:59.899 --> 00:20:02.034 align:middle line:84%
I say put that in there because
actually the second book,

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:03.836 align:middle line:84%
I wrote this book had
to experience the field

00:20:03.836 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and I really encourage people
to do that, to do techniques,

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.575 align:middle line:84%
and you know I'm a
little enthusiastic maybe

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:10.276 align:middle line:90%
about what I did.

00:20:10.276 --> 00:20:11.644 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, maybe.

00:20:11.644 --> 00:20:13.846 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: About what I do but
it's like sharing with them

00:20:13.846 --> 00:20:16.248 align:middle line:84%
like the different ways
you can access the field

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:19.385 align:middle line:84%
which I say is always
there, and all we have

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:21.153 align:middle line:90%
to is just bring ourselves to--

00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:24.456 align:middle line:84%
more our attention to do
different exercise to do it

00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:27.259 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So after
that you, OK-- so put--

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:29.962 align:middle line:84%
you put all of you're
iconography of the--

00:20:29.962 --> 00:20:31.063 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Right

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:31.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- great
gurus of history away.

00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:32.998 align:middle line:90%
You were scared.

00:20:32.998 --> 00:20:35.200 align:middle line:84%
You went back to real life
I supposed for a little bit.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.502 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Well like
one factor about life

00:20:36.502 --> 00:20:38.671 align:middle line:84%
but you know what happens is
like something that's so--

00:20:38.671 --> 00:20:42.775 align:middle line:84%
it's like if you were
to do, a heavy duty drug

00:20:42.775 --> 00:20:44.643 align:middle line:84%
like you might say like
"We'll, I'll never going to do

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:47.279 align:middle line:84%
that again" and then maybe 10
days later you're going like,

00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:48.647 align:middle line:90%
"you know, I wonder if I could--

00:20:48.647 --> 00:20:50.482 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if I could
do and not hurt myself

00:20:50.482 --> 00:20:51.317 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right

00:20:51.317 --> 00:20:52.318 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: So I ordered this--

00:20:52.318 --> 00:20:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Muktananda at the
time was in India.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.756 align:middle line:84%
I mean this guy is 10,000 miles
away and going like "Oh my god."

00:20:57.756 --> 00:20:59.458 align:middle line:84%
It's like I can't even
get close to this guy.

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:02.294 align:middle line:84%
So the book that I ordered
was called So'ham Japa

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:05.631 align:middle line:84%
which is just standard--
simple breath meditation.

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:09.468 align:middle line:84%
So in the in breath, Ham on
the out and you just meet--

00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:12.037 align:middle line:84%
and the way he wrote the book
was great because he says

00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:14.340 align:middle line:84%
"You do it while you're eating,
sleeping, drinking, walking,

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.876 align:middle line:84%
talking., working" whatever you
just do this mantra all the time

00:21:17.876 --> 00:21:19.411 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going like, "Well,
I think I can handle that.

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:24.016 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to die from
doing that but of course me--

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:25.217 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Tended to go--

00:21:25.217 --> 00:21:26.852 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Come to go
overboard so I made this--

00:21:26.852 --> 00:21:29.321 align:middle line:84%
came in, I wanted to look
in control so said, OK,

00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:31.223 align:middle line:84%
I decided like on a
Saturday, I'm going to do this

00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:32.524 align:middle line:90%
for six, I'm going to commit.

00:21:32.524 --> 00:21:34.126 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do this for six
hours like who would say?

00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:35.527 align:middle line:90%
But I said that.

00:21:35.527 --> 00:21:38.163 align:middle line:84%
I committed myself to do it for
six hour and I did it for six

00:21:38.163 --> 00:21:40.132 align:middle line:90%
and then I couldn't stop it.

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:42.334 align:middle line:84%
It just started going
on so it's like.

00:21:42.334 --> 00:21:45.337 align:middle line:84%
You just try to watch
your breath for, you know,

00:21:45.337 --> 00:21:47.306 align:middle line:84%
five minutes or ten
minutes, it becomes,

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:48.907 align:middle line:90%
it's difficult to hold it.

00:21:48.907 --> 00:21:51.143 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
I couldn't stop it

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:54.213 align:middle line:84%
and then those nights
I didn't stop sleeping.

00:21:54.213 --> 00:21:57.082 align:middle line:84%
I was sort of like in this
totally, you know, field.

00:21:57.082 --> 00:21:58.884 align:middle line:84%
I was like in this
ecstatic state,

00:21:58.884 --> 00:22:01.653 align:middle line:84%
had still been celibate
probably now for six month

00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:04.022 align:middle line:84%
with I look back and go,
"This must be part of it.

00:22:04.022 --> 00:22:06.959 align:middle line:84%
I was working for the
University of Florida Department

00:22:06.959 --> 00:22:09.962 align:middle line:84%
of Vegetable Crops, out in their
form and certain times I worked

00:22:09.962 --> 00:22:15.334 align:middle line:84%
in their lab and at one
I was like, you know,

00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:19.037 align:middle line:84%
analyzing the amount of
nitrogen in watermelon leaves.

00:22:19.037 --> 00:22:21.473 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I had my little
sitting on my little stool in--

00:22:21.473 --> 00:22:23.942 align:middle line:84%
in the laboratory and had Bunsen
burner with the leaves in there,

00:22:23.942 --> 00:22:25.044 align:middle line:84%
I'll be cooking them
and they'll be going

00:22:25.044 --> 00:22:26.845 align:middle line:84%
up through a little
twirly thing, you know,

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and the gas will go
thought this meter

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.915 align:middle line:84%
and I can see how
much nitrogen was.

00:22:29.915 --> 00:22:31.683 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden I turn
the thing on immediately,

00:22:31.683 --> 00:22:32.818 align:middle line:90%
my breath would stop, you know,

00:22:32.818 --> 00:22:35.154 align:middle line:84%
my stomach would
distend a little.

00:22:35.154 --> 00:22:37.823 align:middle line:84%
I have this like sort of Kumbak,
you know, you're not breathing

00:22:37.823 --> 00:22:39.491 align:middle line:84%
and my eyes had rolled
up in my head

00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:42.294 align:middle line:84%
and for some reason
there were some witness,

00:22:42.294 --> 00:22:45.030 align:middle line:84%
some part of myself was
like watching this so that--

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.266 align:middle line:84%
I always had to turn the burner
up because all of a sudden

00:22:47.266 --> 00:22:49.935 align:middle line:84%
that hole inside of the beaker
would start to turn black.

00:22:49.935 --> 00:22:52.738 align:middle line:84%
I turn it off just a nick of
time and then put another batch

00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:55.074 align:middle line:84%
in 'cause they were doing
all these different samples

00:22:55.074 --> 00:22:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and here I go again
so that experience--

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.411 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So you
were now living--

00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:01.013 align:middle line:84%
you were living perpetually at
that time with that experience.

00:23:01.013 --> 00:23:01.947 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: I was
living like it, yup!

00:23:01.947 --> 00:23:03.749 align:middle line:84%
And then went on
for like six weeks

00:23:03.749 --> 00:23:07.419 align:middle line:84%
and the big coup de grace
thing that stopped it, OK,

00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:09.922 align:middle line:84%
which was tied in to
my whole childhood

00:23:09.922 --> 00:23:13.592 align:middle line:84%
and everything else was this
woman who I didn't know sort

00:23:13.592 --> 00:23:15.727 align:middle line:84%
of approach me and said,
"Come over to my house"

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:16.929 align:middle line:90%
and I was just like, you know,

00:23:16.929 --> 00:23:18.297 align:middle line:84%
I've just like if
anybody said anything

00:23:18.297 --> 00:23:19.731 align:middle line:90%
to me, I say, "OK, yes."

00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:20.632 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah,
you're at, yeah.

00:23:20.632 --> 00:23:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: If I manage this

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.001 align:middle line:84%
in that state, it's
those movements.

00:23:23.001 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, what do I do now,
and I go over there and she's

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.173 align:middle line:84%
like at the end of the dinner,
pulls me into her bedroom

00:23:28.173 --> 00:23:31.844 align:middle line:90%
and start to have sex with me.

00:23:31.844 --> 00:23:33.645 align:middle line:90%
I mean there's nothing working.

00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:35.781 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's no funky, there's
nobody there and it was sort

00:23:35.781 --> 00:23:37.115 align:middle line:84%
of like, there's
nothing happened,

00:23:37.115 --> 00:23:38.684 align:middle line:84%
there's like nothing
is going on to sort

00:23:38.684 --> 00:23:40.986 align:middle line:90%
of like, "Wow," you know?

00:23:40.986 --> 00:23:43.522 align:middle line:84%
And that funny thing
was the thought came

00:23:43.522 --> 00:23:44.890 align:middle line:90%
in to my mind at that part.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:48.060 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I wonder if-- my
God, it doesn't work anymore.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.361 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like
I never thought.

00:23:49.361 --> 00:23:50.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: To my celibacy.

00:23:50.395 --> 00:23:51.463 align:middle line:90%
Too much celibacy.

00:23:51.463 --> 00:23:52.798 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Yeah,
too much celibacy.

00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:54.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like maybe I just turned
the thing off of together

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.269 align:middle line:84%
so that's like I'm 20
years old at the time.

00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:59.037 align:middle line:84%
I'm going like, OK,
yeah I want this.

00:23:59.037 --> 00:24:01.473 align:middle line:84%
This thing feels great but
it's like I still want to see

00:24:01.473 --> 00:24:02.474 align:middle line:90%
if the equipment works.

00:24:02.474 --> 00:24:03.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:24:03.675 --> 00:24:05.844 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: You know, and
so over the next few days

00:24:05.844 --> 00:24:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and I went home and basically,
you know, ran the equipment

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.117 align:middle line:84%
and guess what, equipment
worked, all right, and it was--

00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:84%
I like to always say that,
you know, when you take--

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.756 align:middle line:84%
play the game of shoots
and ladders, and I--

00:24:17.756 --> 00:24:19.625 align:middle line:84%
it almost as if, if
I hit, hit the ladder

00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:22.528 align:middle line:84%
that took me all the way
to the top, two steps away

00:24:22.528 --> 00:24:26.532 align:middle line:84%
from the final realization and
the next move was I hit this,

00:24:26.532 --> 00:24:31.570 align:middle line:84%
that the-- the slide and I
said it only took me six weeks

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.705 align:middle line:84%
or whatever to go all
the way to the top.

00:24:33.705 --> 00:24:37.109 align:middle line:84%
You know when I came down it
has taken me 35 years to go

00:24:37.109 --> 00:24:39.511 align:middle line:84%
through that thing all the way
and have all these experiences

00:24:39.511 --> 00:24:42.180 align:middle line:84%
and everything that still,
you know, inside me--

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.015 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah

00:24:43.015 --> 00:24:44.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: -- is really stored.

00:24:44.082 --> 00:24:45.417 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I don't
think we can really--

00:24:45.417 --> 00:24:50.055 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the reason why
I say be kind to ourselves,

00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:52.391 align:middle line:84%
be kind to yourself
because the movement,

00:24:52.391 --> 00:24:53.625 align:middle line:84%
the destiny of what
we're going to go

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:54.726 align:middle line:90%
through is going to happen.

00:24:54.726 --> 00:24:56.395 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that
you can do to stop it.

00:24:56.395 --> 00:24:58.530 align:middle line:84%
So to be mean to
yourself in anyway

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.767 align:middle line:90%
if I do not do that, you know--

00:25:01.767 --> 00:25:02.935 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: So you're--

00:25:02.935 --> 00:25:05.938 align:middle line:84%
that altered mystical
state you are in--

00:25:05.938 --> 00:25:07.306 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:25:07.306 --> 00:25:11.376 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Plunged and ended
you-- you're working physically,

00:25:11.376 --> 00:25:12.744 align:middle line:90%
physically everything was fine.

00:25:12.744 --> 00:25:13.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Right, right.

00:25:13.579 --> 00:25:14.813 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: But what happened?

00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:19.017 align:middle line:84%
Why did one have to
interrupt the other?

00:25:19.017 --> 00:25:20.185 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: I would, it
ends up-- part of me--

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:22.154 align:middle line:84%
I think from a brain
chemistry stand point it's

00:25:22.154 --> 00:25:24.756 align:middle line:84%
like when you organism, it's
like your brain gets flooded

00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:27.459 align:middle line:84%
with dopamine and oxytocin
and all of a sudden, it stops.

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:29.995 align:middle line:84%
It's more like, it's almost like
a reset, it's almost like going

00:25:29.995 --> 00:25:31.830 align:middle line:84%
up to your computer
and rebooting it.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.999 align:middle line:84%
And so all of a sudden,
the mind and the thoughts,

00:25:33.999 --> 00:25:37.235 align:middle line:84%
it was unbelievably 'cause prior
to that there was no thought.

00:25:37.235 --> 00:25:38.337 align:middle line:90%
It's almost just witnessing.

00:25:38.337 --> 00:25:39.871 align:middle line:84%
I would just be witnessing
my breath.

00:25:39.871 --> 00:25:41.974 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden I
say you have between 12

00:25:41.974 --> 00:25:44.109 align:middle line:90%
and 60,000 thoughts a day, boom.

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:46.044 align:middle line:84%
As soon as that happen,
I was right back to 12

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:50.882 align:middle line:84%
to 60,000 thoughts and I could
not-- I try to like stop.

00:25:50.882 --> 00:25:51.883 align:middle line:90%
I try to get rid of--

00:25:51.883 --> 00:25:53.251 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But somehow
it didn't work

00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:54.286 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Nothing,
it wouldn't work.

00:25:54.286 --> 00:25:55.921 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't work.

00:25:55.921 --> 00:26:00.158 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to transfer into
the University of Florida now

00:26:00.158 --> 00:26:03.895 align:middle line:84%
from my junior year of college
and I was like that seem

00:26:03.895 --> 00:26:06.131 align:middle line:84%
like a joke because after
these two experiences.

00:26:06.131 --> 00:26:08.100 align:middle line:84%
I was like who needs
to go out of college,

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.868 align:middle line:84%
that's like the most
insane thing,

00:26:09.868 --> 00:26:11.536 align:middle line:90%
but I hightailed it out Florida.

00:26:11.536 --> 00:26:14.906 align:middle line:84%
I went back to work at the baker
with my dad and so I was like,

00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:17.676 align:middle line:84%
so I wanted some sort of
normalcy, I was just grabbing

00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:21.279 align:middle line:84%
out straws and I went back
there and I was terrified.

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And muktananda was coming to
United States and I did not want

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.319 align:middle line:84%
to see him 'cause I though
if he could do this to me

00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:29.521 align:middle line:84%
from that distance
that he saw me, I'd--

00:26:29.521 --> 00:26:30.722 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: You're blaming him

00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:33.291 align:middle line:84%
when in fact it was you
connecting intentionally.

00:26:33.291 --> 00:26:34.693 align:middle line:90%
You used the tools.

00:26:34.693 --> 00:26:36.428 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Well, of course, but
I was thinking that, you know.

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:37.696 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: He was, yeah.

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: You know, they
always envisioned Cheever

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:39.898 align:middle line:84%
as the Keller [assumed
spelling].

00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:41.266 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: So, I thought, you
know, he's going to see me,

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.168 align:middle line:84%
see me and go like
you screwed up.

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:44.569 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:26:44.569 --> 00:26:46.571 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: He's going to hit me
with some eyes and go, you know,

00:26:46.571 --> 00:26:48.540 align:middle line:84%
it's like fry me as
soon as he saw me.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So it took me, I went
through a real bad experience

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:55.814 align:middle line:84%
with Cynthia, my high
school girlfriend and it was

00:26:55.814 --> 00:26:59.184 align:middle line:84%
like so devastating but then
as I finally go, I got to go.

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:00.152 align:middle line:90%
I got to go get.

00:27:00.152 --> 00:27:02.020 align:middle line:84%
I got to go be with
the guru, Kuchi.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.355 align:middle line:90%
I know he's my guru--

00:27:03.355 --> 00:27:05.757 align:middle line:84%
I was actually walking around
with a button, he's face,

00:27:05.757 --> 00:27:08.560 align:middle line:84%
you know, delivering bread in
Tarrytown with a guru, you know.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.828 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: On your chest.

00:27:09.828 --> 00:27:10.529 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: You know, I'm
like-- and the guys are going,

00:27:10.529 --> 00:27:11.396 align:middle line:90%
"What the hell is that?"

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:12.164 align:middle line:90%
I said, "That's my guru."

00:27:12.164 --> 00:27:12.798 align:middle line:90%
They go, "Yeah, right."

00:27:12.798 --> 00:27:13.765 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:14.866 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: You know,
it's like crazy.

00:27:14.866 --> 00:27:16.702 align:middle line:84%
It's like, this guy
is out of his mind so.

00:27:16.702 --> 00:27:19.171 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So the interesting
thing was by taking yourself

00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:22.541 align:middle line:84%
out of that state, that's what
threw you into your journey

00:27:22.541 --> 00:27:25.577 align:middle line:84%
because you are then
trying to re-establish--

00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:26.411 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Exactly.

00:27:26.411 --> 00:27:27.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- that connection

00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:28.580 align:middle line:84%
with the divine aspect
of yourself.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:29.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Oh totally, totally.

00:27:29.915 --> 00:27:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so-- if you
have, you would have never gone

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.986 align:middle line:84%
on this amazing journey,
had you not gone the ladder

00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:36.188 align:middle line:90%
and shoots from ladders.

00:27:36.188 --> 00:27:37.355 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: That's
right, that's right.

00:27:37.355 --> 00:27:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So you
went down the ladder,

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:41.326 align:middle line:84%
you ended up finding the
guru, you found the guru,

00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:42.694 align:middle line:84%
you ended up going
to Ashram [phonetic].

00:27:42.694 --> 00:27:43.762 align:middle line:90%
It was in Oakland?

00:27:43.762 --> 00:27:44.563 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: It was
Oakland, that's right.

00:27:44.563 --> 00:27:45.397 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:27:45.397 --> 00:27:46.932 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: It was in Oakland.

00:27:46.932 --> 00:27:49.701 align:middle line:84%
I went out there and I was
like the funny thing was it's

00:27:49.701 --> 00:27:52.738 align:middle line:84%
like now it's like so
repentant that I was on--

00:27:52.738 --> 00:27:56.074 align:middle line:84%
At first I will do anything
the guru tells me to do

00:27:56.074 --> 00:27:58.043 align:middle line:84%
and I got three days
off with my dad.

00:27:58.043 --> 00:28:00.378 align:middle line:84%
I said I'm flying out to
California, all right.

00:28:00.378 --> 00:28:02.047 align:middle line:84%
I was just going to
go out and come back

00:28:02.047 --> 00:28:03.882 align:middle line:90%
and then go back out again.

00:28:03.882 --> 00:28:05.517 align:middle line:90%
So I have my private meeting.

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:08.019 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time
I physically meeting him

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:09.621 align:middle line:84%
and he's sitting
in there, so the--

00:28:09.621 --> 00:28:11.356 align:middle line:84%
just allow me, just
translate he goes,

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:14.526 align:middle line:84%
"Baba" that's what we called
him, he did not speak any,

00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:16.528 align:middle line:84%
any English and I said, "I
will do anything you want."

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:17.796 align:middle line:90%
What do you want me to do?"

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:19.164 align:middle line:84%
And he's like laughed, he
goes, "Stay this weekend."

00:28:19.164 --> 00:28:20.465 align:middle line:84%
He's like, hitting
me this teacup.

00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:21.666 align:middle line:84%
"Stay." I'm going
like, "I can't stay."

00:28:21.666 --> 00:28:23.268 align:middle line:84%
He's like, laughing,
"No, no, no, stay."

00:28:23.268 --> 00:28:25.837 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, you know, I left there
'cause I promised my dad I'd

00:28:25.837 --> 00:28:27.139 align:middle line:90%
come back.

00:28:27.139 --> 00:28:28.607 align:middle line:84%
You know, I said, "No, I'm
not going to-- I can't stay.

00:28:28.607 --> 00:28:31.576 align:middle line:84%
I said to Baba, I can't stay
but I'll end up coming back

00:28:31.576 --> 00:28:34.179 align:middle line:84%
but then when-- he just left the
room and he was like laughing

00:28:34.179 --> 00:28:37.215 align:middle line:84%
and laughing and laughing like
he was just reading my mind,

00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:39.084 align:middle line:90%
knowing I'm trying to surrender

00:28:39.084 --> 00:28:40.585 align:middle line:84%
and I can't do the
simplest thing

00:28:40.585 --> 00:28:42.554 align:middle line:84%
that he's telling
me to do, you know?

00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:43.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:28:43.955 --> 00:28:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: And of course, in the
flight back, I'm beating myself

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.092 align:middle line:84%
up again like I waited
all this time

00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:49.795 align:middle line:84%
and I can't follow the guy
instructions, you know?

00:28:49.795 --> 00:28:53.498 align:middle line:84%
But then I did end up going out,
so I live there for six month

00:28:53.498 --> 00:28:56.101 align:middle line:84%
and just have like-- it
was amazing because--

00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:57.969 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, and you ended
up in an interesting position.

00:28:57.969 --> 00:29:02.040 align:middle line:84%
There seem to be a connection
between the two of you, right?

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.909 align:middle line:84%
Kind of ended that--
you ended up closer

00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:05.310 align:middle line:90%
than most people do to a guru.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.946 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Well, the thing was
because of my bakery experience,

00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:10.482 align:middle line:84%
they put me in this tiny
little armor which is really

00:29:10.482 --> 00:29:11.817 align:middle line:90%
about the size of the stature.

00:29:11.817 --> 00:29:14.686 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very small, you
know, it had like three tables

00:29:14.686 --> 00:29:18.523 align:middle line:84%
and there might be five or
six stools and there was maybe

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:20.992 align:middle line:84%
like 200 people that were
living in the Ashram at the time

00:29:20.992 --> 00:29:22.794 align:middle line:84%
and they had-- we're
having programs and--

00:29:22.794 --> 00:29:24.129 align:middle line:84%
the programs are
wild 'cause it was

00:29:24.129 --> 00:29:26.198 align:middle line:84%
like crazy kundalini
experiences.

00:29:26.198 --> 00:29:29.935 align:middle line:84%
People were like, you know, it
sounded like a jungle literally/

00:29:29.935 --> 00:29:31.002 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:29:31.002 --> 00:29:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: And people
are flying into--

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.738 align:middle line:84%
I mean Muktananda would go
around and touch everybody

00:29:33.738 --> 00:29:36.474 align:middle line:84%
and just like light them
up like it was unreal,

00:29:36.474 --> 00:29:38.009 align:middle line:84%
and I was having a lot
of Kundalini experience,

00:29:38.009 --> 00:29:39.611 align:middle line:84%
but for the most part
I was like working.

00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:43.114 align:middle line:84%
I was living their full time
in this little place, you know?

00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:45.417 align:middle line:84%
And I had a number of
interaction with him

00:29:45.417 --> 00:29:46.651 align:middle line:90%
which were kind of funny.

00:29:46.651 --> 00:29:48.353 align:middle line:84%
One night he basically
was looking

00:29:48.353 --> 00:29:51.022 align:middle line:84%
for the person who's running
the place and he was looking

00:29:51.022 --> 00:29:52.824 align:middle line:84%
in from the outside of
the window in the dark

00:29:52.824 --> 00:29:54.926 align:middle line:84%
and I thought it was-- it was
in the bad section of Oakland

00:29:54.926 --> 00:29:57.062 align:middle line:84%
and they thought, I thought
somebody was robbing us

00:29:57.062 --> 00:29:58.997 align:middle line:84%
so I got a baseball
bat and I was like,

00:29:58.997 --> 00:30:00.799 align:middle line:84%
going over to the door,
opening the door like I'm going

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:02.801 align:middle line:84%
to hit this guy,
it's Muktananda.

00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:04.870 align:middle line:84%
With no teeth coming
in like that,

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.004 align:middle line:90%
he wanted one to kill somebody.

00:30:06.004 --> 00:30:07.272 align:middle line:90%
He's like, "Where is"--

00:30:07.272 --> 00:30:09.241 align:middle line:84%
you know, "Where is this
girl Tara [assumed spelling]?

00:30:09.241 --> 00:30:10.508 align:middle line:90%
You know, "Where is she?"

00:30:10.508 --> 00:30:13.645 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, "I
don't, you know?

00:30:13.645 --> 00:30:14.713 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't even say that.

00:30:14.713 --> 00:30:16.815 align:middle line:84%
He just like almost
foaming at the mouth

00:30:16.815 --> 00:30:18.650 align:middle line:84%
and this other girl
runs in and he goes,

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:19.885 align:middle line:90%
you know, "Where is Tara?"

00:30:19.885 --> 00:30:21.419 align:middle line:84%
And I go, "I don't know"
and she looks up, bothered,

00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:22.854 align:middle line:84%
and looks back at
me and she goes,

00:30:22.854 --> 00:30:24.656 align:middle line:84%
"That's the wrong
answer," you know.

00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:25.657 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:26.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Like he
knew I knew that.

00:30:26.358 --> 00:30:26.925 align:middle line:90%
He knew where she was.

00:30:26.925 --> 00:30:28.026 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:30:28.026 --> 00:30:29.027 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: He was--
you know, so by that--

00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:30.428 align:middle line:84%
it's like those types
of interactions.

00:30:30.428 --> 00:30:32.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, you ended up
as kind of a security guard--

00:30:32.063 --> 00:30:33.365 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Well, yeah.

00:30:33.365 --> 00:30:34.199 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- so to speak
for the facility after that.

00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:34.833 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Well, a little bit.

00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:35.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:36.101 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: I look back--

00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:36.935 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:30:36.935 --> 00:30:37.502 align:middle line:90%
You kind of you kept the order.

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:38.703 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:30:38.703 --> 00:30:40.305 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And then, really
the most significant thing

00:30:40.305 --> 00:30:41.773 align:middle line:84%
that happened was
after I was there

00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:45.610 align:middle line:84%
for six months some girl walks
into the little juice bar

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and says, "You want to
have some ice cream?"

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:54.319 align:middle line:84%
And her name was Sherry [assumed
spelling] and three days later,

00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:56.888 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting in the
evening program, all right,

00:30:56.888 --> 00:30:58.757 align:middle line:84%
sitting there, meditating
and I can hear this voice,

00:30:58.757 --> 00:30:59.991 align:middle line:90%
"Ask that girl to marry you."

00:30:59.991 --> 00:31:01.960 align:middle line:90%
I was like, "No way."

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.428 align:middle line:90%
"No. Are you out of your minds?"

00:31:03.428 --> 00:31:05.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like, "Ask this
girl to marry you?"

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.766 align:middle line:84%
So I actually got up
in darshan [phonetic],

00:31:07.766 --> 00:31:09.701 align:middle line:84%
everybody standing there
with their fruits or bananas

00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:10.735 align:middle line:90%
and flowers and everything,

00:31:10.735 --> 00:31:12.504 align:middle line:84%
a big one wine going
up to Muktananda.

00:31:12.504 --> 00:31:14.372 align:middle line:84%
I walked up to this
girl and I say,

00:31:14.372 --> 00:31:15.240 align:middle line:90%
you know, "Will you marry me?"

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.108 align:middle line:90%
And she says, "Yes," all right.

00:31:17.108 --> 00:31:20.245 align:middle line:84%
Get to the final line and Baba's
like, he's hitting us like yes,

00:31:20.245 --> 00:31:21.680 align:middle line:84%
get married a very
nice wedding which is

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.415 align:middle line:90%
like in two weeks, you know?

00:31:23.415 --> 00:31:24.849 align:middle line:84%
People don't even know
who this girl was.

00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:27.185 align:middle line:84%
It's like I hardly even
knew who this girl was.

00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:30.288 align:middle line:84%
And he used to like-- Baba used
to love to tell stories like,

00:31:30.288 --> 00:31:32.724 align:middle line:84%
"You can meet somebody in
the back of the darshan line

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:34.025 align:middle line:90%
and get married when--

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:35.527 align:middle line:84%
by the time you get to the
front of the darshan line."

00:31:35.527 --> 00:31:36.861 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:31:36.861 --> 00:31:37.963 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, you were
just going with the movement--

00:31:37.963 --> 00:31:38.964 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: I was just
going with the flow.

00:31:38.964 --> 00:31:39.664 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- following
your impulse.

00:31:39.664 --> 00:31:40.765 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: That's right.

00:31:40.765 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like
listening to, you know,

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.035 align:middle line:84%
when the force is moving
through me which is--

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:44.736 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And that's the key.

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:45.437 align:middle line:90%
You just listen.

00:31:45.437 --> 00:31:46.805 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: That's right.

00:31:46.805 --> 00:31:48.173 align:middle line:84%
Listen. That's why I say just
listening and even the stuff

00:31:48.173 --> 00:31:50.608 align:middle line:84%
that I end up later doing with
business and everything else

00:31:50.608 --> 00:31:52.377 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of people
go like, "Wow.

00:31:52.377 --> 00:31:53.478 align:middle line:90%
Why would you do that?"

00:31:53.478 --> 00:31:55.213 align:middle line:84%
or just like a good
listener just to hear.

00:31:55.213 --> 00:31:56.548 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, yeah.

00:31:56.548 --> 00:31:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So, now that you get married
after a period of time and--

00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:59.851 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:31:59.851 --> 00:32:00.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- and there's
a miscarriages and so--

00:32:00.485 --> 00:32:01.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Right.

00:32:01.052 --> 00:32:02.487 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:32:02.487 --> 00:32:03.555 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- you ultimately
have these two fantastic kids.

00:32:03.555 --> 00:32:05.790 align:middle line:84%
But, during all of
these, you go to India--

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Right.

00:32:07.125 --> 00:32:08.093 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- and there's
some other thing that's rising

00:32:08.093 --> 00:32:09.461 align:middle line:90%
in this.

00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:11.029 align:middle line:84%
And it's an important thing
to talk about because we have

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:14.232 align:middle line:84%
to learn to be more nuance in
our thinking in my opinion.

00:32:14.232 --> 00:32:15.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:32:15.533 --> 00:32:16.801 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And that is, you
started hearing murmurings

00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:18.570 align:middle line:90%
that celibacy was taught.

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:20.905 align:middle line:84%
At the ashram there
was no fraternization

00:32:20.905 --> 00:32:21.740 align:middle line:84%
between the men and
the women, right?

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.341 align:middle line:90%
They sat at different sides.

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:23.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Different sides--

00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:25.043 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:25.977 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- and it was
a celibate environment

00:32:25.977 --> 00:32:27.012 align:middle line:84%
and that was from
the guru, right?

00:32:27.012 --> 00:32:28.346 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Right.

00:32:28.346 --> 00:32:30.815 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And that yet you
started hearing and finding

00:32:30.815 --> 00:32:34.185 align:middle line:84%
out that that didn't
necessarily apply to the guru.

00:32:34.185 --> 00:32:37.155 align:middle line:84%
This is very upsetting to a lot
of people who followed anyone.

00:32:37.155 --> 00:32:37.989 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: That's right.

00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:39.391 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:32:39.391 --> 00:32:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Tell us what happened
about that and about the woman--

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:84%
the woman side of it, his
side of it and what you kind

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.132 align:middle line:84%
of took away because you
were angry when you found

00:32:47.132 --> 00:32:49.567 align:middle line:84%
out he wasn't living
by his own rules.

00:32:49.567 --> 00:32:50.702 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:52.103 align:middle line:84%
Well, the one-- I think
the one funny incident

00:32:52.103 --> 00:32:55.440 align:middle line:84%
that happened in-- when I was
living in India was that coming

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.742 align:middle line:84%
from New York was right at
that time that Son of Sam

00:32:57.742 --> 00:33:00.912 align:middle line:84%
with this mass murderer was
so I had killed like seven

00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:02.213 align:middle line:90%
or seven different couples.

00:33:02.213 --> 00:33:04.549 align:middle line:84%
He just go up and shoot
these people in the car, so.

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:05.483 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:07.852 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: And one
night at the end

00:33:07.852 --> 00:33:10.789 align:middle line:84%
to this program,
Baba never came out.

00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:12.090 align:middle line:84%
He basically comes
out of the thing

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.392 align:middle line:84%
and he's got these Newsweek
and Time Magazine and Son

00:33:14.392 --> 00:33:15.593 align:middle line:90%
of Sam is on the cover.

00:33:15.593 --> 00:33:17.629 align:middle line:84%
Now I know who Son of
Sam is 'cause I'm driving

00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:19.030 align:middle line:84%
through Harlem in the
middle of the night.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:24.269 align:middle line:84%
It was like-- and he's going,
"This guy is my guru brother."

00:33:24.269 --> 00:33:25.470 align:middle line:84%
"Hey, this guy is
my guru brother

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.906 align:middle line:84%
because he is killing
people, OK."

00:33:27.906 --> 00:33:30.809 align:middle line:84%
He's shooting people, who
are doing what he referred

00:33:30.809 --> 00:33:33.678 align:middle line:84%
to "Buffalo [inaudible]"
which is basically

00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:35.346 align:middle line:90%
like animals having sex.

00:33:35.346 --> 00:33:37.916 align:middle line:84%
This is what Son of Sam assumed
like lovers that were in car.

00:33:37.916 --> 00:33:39.517 align:middle line:84%
Somebody was doing that
in the upper garden

00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:40.819 align:middle line:90%
of the ashram today.

00:33:40.819 --> 00:33:43.088 align:middle line:84%
You know, so to me, it's
like, "Whoa," you know.

00:33:43.088 --> 00:33:44.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Whoa!

00:33:44.255 --> 00:33:46.558 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: He's like
such a strong stance, OK,

00:33:46.558 --> 00:33:49.094 align:middle line:90%
of against this whole thing.

00:33:49.094 --> 00:33:51.696 align:middle line:84%
So at that particular point,
I mean it sort of like

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:54.399 align:middle line:84%
that just supported my
belief system but it wasn't

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:58.870 align:middle line:84%
until after he came back to
United States right after that

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:00.205 align:middle line:90%
and we were living in Boston.

00:34:00.205 --> 00:34:03.041 align:middle line:84%
He came to the Boston ashram
a couple of times, you know,

00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:05.243 align:middle line:90%
for three weeks each time.

00:34:05.243 --> 00:34:07.811 align:middle line:84%
That when he was there, that
right after that we ended

00:34:07.811 --> 00:34:10.514 align:middle line:90%
up having our kids and I found

00:34:10.514 --> 00:34:14.052 align:middle line:84%
out that this whole thing
was going down with him.

00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:15.587 align:middle line:90%
And there's like a lot of--

00:34:15.587 --> 00:34:16.721 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Then the girl--

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:18.356 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: The girl and
then there's a lot of--

00:34:18.356 --> 00:34:21.358 align:middle line:84%
you know, Liz Harris from
the New York magazine wrote

00:34:21.358 --> 00:34:23.228 align:middle line:84%
like a great article about
this stuff and there's some

00:34:23.228 --> 00:34:24.829 align:middle line:84%
of the other stuffs
that's on the line.

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: A lot of
exposes on [inaudible].

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:26.197 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: A lot of-- yeah.

00:34:26.197 --> 00:34:26.998 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:34:26.998 --> 00:34:27.866 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: A lot of exposes.

00:34:27.866 --> 00:34:29.200 align:middle line:84%
A lot of exposes
specific on him.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.502 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:34:30.502 --> 00:34:32.036 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: But to me, with
my background and being this

00:34:32.036 --> 00:34:34.606 align:middle line:84%
and knowing the power
of the celibacy,

00:34:34.606 --> 00:34:36.674 align:middle line:84%
this is very, very
confusing to me.

00:34:36.674 --> 00:34:38.476 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing was
that the women

00:34:38.476 --> 00:34:41.479 align:middle line:84%
that I taught including my wife
and other people that were close

00:34:41.479 --> 00:34:43.114 align:middle line:84%
by they were actually
it was like, "Oh,

00:34:43.114 --> 00:34:44.749 align:middle line:90%
I wish she sleep with me."

00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:47.184 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like, the way,
he walk around when he talk,

00:34:47.184 --> 00:34:48.887 align:middle line:84%
touch people, the
experiences that they have.

00:34:48.887 --> 00:34:50.255 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine what they--

00:34:50.255 --> 00:34:52.891 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, 'cause they're
having spontaneous instances

00:34:52.891 --> 00:34:54.793 align:middle line:84%
of a bliss like experience,
right?

00:34:54.793 --> 00:34:56.161 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Who can
blame them-- yeah.

00:34:56.161 --> 00:34:58.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's like having sex with
him must be like unbelievable.

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.299 align:middle line:84%
But to me I was more like,
well, he can't be walking

00:35:01.299 --> 00:35:04.636 align:middle line:84%
around in orange and holding up
this image and then doing that.

00:35:04.636 --> 00:35:06.137 align:middle line:84%
It's like, this is
crazy, you know?

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:07.505 align:middle line:90%
I was like furious.

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:09.841 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to like-- you know,
if I could get my hands on him,

00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:12.977 align:middle line:84%
I'd basically-- you know, I'd
really didn't know what's going

00:35:12.977 --> 00:35:16.881 align:middle line:84%
on and then as your-- what I
found out over the years, OK,

00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:19.517 align:middle line:84%
that I actually had
conversations with women

00:35:19.517 --> 00:35:21.920 align:middle line:84%
who had direct experiences
with him--

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:22.987 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Uh-hmm.

00:35:22.987 --> 00:35:23.955 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: -- and what
was going on there

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:27.358 align:middle line:84%
which was much sweeter
and benign--

00:35:27.358 --> 00:35:28.493 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:30.228 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: -- than my
mind could conceive of.

00:35:30.228 --> 00:35:32.964 align:middle line:84%
And even at the very end of the
book, I basically sort of come

00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:36.801 align:middle line:84%
to this conclusion from my
own sexuality and experience

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:39.537 align:middle line:84%
of what was really going
in there but it did take me

00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:41.472 align:middle line:84%
on because we haven't talked
about the businesses at all yet.

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:42.974 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, that's
what we're coming to.

00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:43.808 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:44.876 align:middle line:90%
They took me on a whole thing.

00:35:44.876 --> 00:35:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because
you were disappointed.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:46.744 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: I was disappointed

00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:48.780 align:middle line:84%
and I really wanted
to figure it out.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.181 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:35:50.181 --> 00:35:55.286 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But interestingly,
if you look at it in hindsight,

00:35:55.286 --> 00:35:58.489 align:middle line:84%
what he was giving you by
way of experience as a group

00:35:58.489 --> 00:36:02.126 align:middle line:84%
and these individuals of his
practices and the meditations

00:36:02.126 --> 00:36:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and so forth had
extreme value obviously.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:05.897 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:06.931 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, yeah.

00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:07.932 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: He was
a master of energy.

00:36:07.932 --> 00:36:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.669 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And a really
blissful divine type of energy--

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:12.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: That's right.

00:36:12.604 --> 00:36:13.371 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- on
some level, right?

00:36:13.371 --> 00:36:14.706 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Oh yeah.

00:36:14.706 --> 00:36:15.273 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: He was able to
transfer that to other people.

00:36:15.273 --> 00:36:16.608 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:36:16.608 --> 00:36:17.408 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of people, thousands
of people would say that.

00:36:17.408 --> 00:36:18.676 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:21.145 align:middle line:84%
And so, we do this, we set
people up who might have--

00:36:21.145 --> 00:36:22.513 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:23.882 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- something of value
to offer and then they fall

00:36:23.882 --> 00:36:27.252 align:middle line:84%
down by their supposed own rules
and we want to immediately--

00:36:27.252 --> 00:36:28.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Crucify them.

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:29.287 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- obscure
them and crucify them.

00:36:29.287 --> 00:36:30.588 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:36:30.588 --> 00:36:32.957 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so it took a
while before your thinking

00:36:32.957 --> 00:36:35.293 align:middle line:84%
started becoming a
little more cohesive

00:36:35.293 --> 00:36:37.095 align:middle line:90%
or nuanced in that area.

00:36:37.095 --> 00:36:38.363 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:36:38.363 --> 00:36:39.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So now, let's
talk about what happened next

00:36:39.063 --> 00:36:40.231 align:middle line:90%
because you have a wife.

00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:41.633 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: I have a wife.

00:36:41.633 --> 00:36:43.134 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You're in Boston, you
have a couple of kids and now,

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:45.637 align:middle line:90%
it's time to go make some money.

00:36:45.637 --> 00:36:46.571 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Right.

00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:47.272 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You had
to do something.

00:36:47.272 --> 00:36:48.339 align:middle line:90%
You can support this--

00:36:48.339 --> 00:36:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Right.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.975 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- Get on
air and be alone, right?

00:36:50.975 --> 00:36:51.542 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Right.

00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:52.911 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:36:52.911 --> 00:36:54.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So let's talk about
how it originally happened.

00:36:54.045 --> 00:36:55.113 align:middle line:90%
I love this story.

00:36:55.113 --> 00:36:55.913 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Right.

00:36:55.913 --> 00:36:56.848 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And I remember--

00:36:56.848 --> 00:36:57.448 align:middle line:84%
because I remember
the companies.

00:36:57.448 --> 00:36:58.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:36:58.016 --> 00:36:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Well the--
I had a couple of job.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:06.858 align:middle line:84%
When I was managing that
ashram in Boston, you know,

00:37:06.858 --> 00:37:08.192 align:middle line:90%
I had other jobs on the outside

00:37:08.192 --> 00:37:09.761 align:middle line:84%
like selling insurance
and stuff like that.

00:37:09.761 --> 00:37:13.698 align:middle line:84%
But-- and then I worked for
this massage roller company

00:37:13.698 --> 00:37:15.099 align:middle line:90%
and just joined--

00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:17.068 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Kind of the Footsie
massage, the ones in the back?

00:37:17.068 --> 00:37:18.369 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Yeah, the Footsie
Roller massage something

00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:19.203 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:37:19.203 --> 00:37:20.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah that's right.

00:37:20.305 --> 00:37:21.639 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: And then
the guy-- I basically--

00:37:21.639 --> 00:37:23.207 align:middle line:84%
the company that sales like
we took off in our company.

00:37:23.207 --> 00:37:24.876 align:middle line:84%
I real wanted to--
the guy want it

00:37:24.876 --> 00:37:26.311 align:middle line:84%
to sell it 'cause he
couldn't make a lot of money

00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:28.646 align:middle line:84%
but he wouldn't do it then
finally when he did sell it,

00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:30.415 align:middle line:84%
you know, he sold them
when the price is way down.

00:37:30.415 --> 00:37:32.684 align:middle line:84%
So, I said on my own it's
like what am I going to do?

00:37:32.684 --> 00:37:35.887 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm going, OK, let's
do a footwear company.

00:37:35.887 --> 00:37:37.689 align:middle line:90%
And the funny thing is--

00:37:37.689 --> 00:37:39.123 align:middle line:84%
you don't even know
anything about footwear.

00:37:39.123 --> 00:37:40.425 align:middle line:90%
It's OK, I know a little bit.

00:37:40.425 --> 00:37:41.626 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Why did
you choose footwear?

00:37:41.626 --> 00:37:44.062 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: While we were
doing some massage sandals

00:37:44.062 --> 00:37:45.129 align:middle line:90%
at this company--

00:37:45.129 --> 00:37:46.331 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:37:46.331 --> 00:37:47.498 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: -- OK, so I
knew a little bit about--

00:37:47.498 --> 00:37:49.834 align:middle line:84%
I could buy like 68
cents sandals from Taiwan

00:37:49.834 --> 00:37:52.537 align:middle line:84%
and sell them for 3 dollars
through CVS or Walgreens

00:37:52.537 --> 00:37:54.906 align:middle line:84%
and have them retail
for like 5 bucks.

00:37:54.906 --> 00:37:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right, right.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.175 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: OK, so
I knew a little bit

00:37:57.175 --> 00:37:59.510 align:middle line:84%
about the footwear business
and the two companies,

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:03.548 align:middle line:84%
Rebook which was in Boston
and Paul Fireman knew nothing

00:38:03.548 --> 00:38:05.583 align:middle line:84%
about the footwear
business before he got

00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:06.818 align:middle line:90%
into starting Rebook.

00:38:06.818 --> 00:38:10.521 align:middle line:84%
And then L.A. Gear, Bob
Greenberg was a hairdresser

00:38:10.521 --> 00:38:12.123 align:middle line:84%
in the same town I was
living in at the time,

00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:14.392 align:middle line:90%
Newton but he was out in Venice.

00:38:14.392 --> 00:38:15.693 align:middle line:84%
Both of those guys
took companies

00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:17.862 align:middle line:90%
to a billion dollars in sales.

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:18.963 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't know--

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:19.731 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And they
didn't know anything.

00:38:19.731 --> 00:38:20.865 align:middle line:90%
So you were qualified too.

00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:21.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: -- that's why
I said I was qualified.

00:38:21.532 --> 00:38:22.633 align:middle line:90%
I'm from Newton.

00:38:22.633 --> 00:38:23.901 align:middle line:84%
I know nothing about
the footwear business.

00:38:23.901 --> 00:38:25.536 align:middle line:90%
This must be perfect, you know?

00:38:25.536 --> 00:38:26.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:38:26.904 --> 00:38:28.473 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: So I basically--
and I saw I needed to come up.

00:38:28.473 --> 00:38:30.575 align:middle line:84%
So the name of the company
that we came up with was Ryka.

00:38:30.575 --> 00:38:32.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you and your
wife started it together?

00:38:32.477 --> 00:38:33.878 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: We-- that's right.

00:38:33.878 --> 00:38:36.748 align:middle line:84%
And RYKA, R-Y-K-A, my mother's
maiden name was Riker, R-I-K-E-R

00:38:36.748 --> 00:38:39.083 align:middle line:84%
but we go, "We need to
make it a little bit--

00:38:39.083 --> 00:38:40.284 align:middle line:90%
you know, European-look."

00:38:40.284 --> 00:38:43.354 align:middle line:84%
So we did R-Y-K-A and put
two umlauts over the A

00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:45.790 align:middle line:84%
to make it look like Haagen-Dazs
and those were the logos

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:47.325 align:middle line:90%
on the back of the shoes.

00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:53.264 align:middle line:84%
And probably I'd say
only a year and a half

00:38:53.264 --> 00:38:55.066 align:middle line:84%
after starting the
idea of this company,

00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:57.402 align:middle line:90%
the company had no sales at all.

00:38:57.402 --> 00:39:04.275 align:middle line:84%
And we took the company
public on February 12th, 1988.

00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:05.643 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: OK, so I
want to talk about that.

00:39:05.643 --> 00:39:06.778 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: OK, OK,
let's talk about--

00:39:06.778 --> 00:39:08.112 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because one
of the funniest stories

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:12.884 align:middle line:84%
in the book is people don't
understand how manifestation

00:39:12.884 --> 00:39:14.252 align:middle line:90%
works in general.

00:39:14.252 --> 00:39:17.221 align:middle line:84%
Where all as a species
beginning to learn

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:18.556 align:middle line:90%
that this is our creation--

00:39:18.556 --> 00:39:19.757 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:21.159 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- and we can
create it the way we want.

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have to look like
anything out of out a textbook

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.829 align:middle line:90%
or like anybody else's canvas.

00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:28.199 align:middle line:84%
And you already knew that
because you're understanding

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:31.135 align:middle line:84%
in your meditation and those
sublime experiences you had had

00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:32.870 align:middle line:90%
is that it's already here.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.005 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: That's right.

00:39:34.005 --> 00:39:34.772 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: In a sense
it's already happened.

00:39:34.772 --> 00:39:35.573 align:middle line:90%
You have to walk into it.

00:39:35.573 --> 00:39:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: That's right.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And that is key

00:39:37.675 --> 00:39:39.010 align:middle line:84%
because most people
don't feel it.

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:40.244 align:middle line:90%
It's already happened.

00:39:40.244 --> 00:39:43.448 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a story about
having to go to your meeting

00:39:43.448 --> 00:39:47.585 align:middle line:84%
to get this kind of incredible
monetary support and backing

00:39:47.585 --> 00:39:50.054 align:middle line:84%
with nothing but a drawing
from your babysitter.

00:39:50.054 --> 00:39:50.788 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: That's right.

00:39:50.788 --> 00:39:52.089 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I love this.

00:39:52.089 --> 00:39:54.725 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: So I-- you know,
I was just like sitting

00:39:54.725 --> 00:39:56.394 align:middle line:84%
in a house one day I
thought like, well--

00:39:56.394 --> 00:39:59.797 align:middle line:84%
you know, I need
besides the Ryka name,

00:39:59.797 --> 00:40:00.965 align:middle line:84%
we need like another
cachet or something--

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:02.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: How about a picture.

00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:03.701 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: OK, picture
of or something like this

00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:06.070 align:middle line:84%
when I get the idea, I was
like, call the U.S. Ski team up,

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.405 align:middle line:90%
you know, so they have dry--

00:40:07.405 --> 00:40:10.208 align:middle line:84%
at the time cross training
was a big thing so I was like,

00:40:10.208 --> 00:40:13.778 align:middle line:84%
let's do cross training shoes
and I called the U.S. Ski team,

00:40:13.778 --> 00:40:15.346 align:middle line:84%
can we be the official--
I didn't even have a shoe.

00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:16.981 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even have
a drawing of a shoe.

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:19.784 align:middle line:84%
And the guy from Subaru had
just moved over from Subaru

00:40:19.784 --> 00:40:21.185 align:middle line:84%
to the U.S. Ski team,
he goes come

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:22.453 align:middle line:84%
down to the Waldorf
[phonetic], if I'm going to be

00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:24.555 align:middle line:84%
in New York next week
I fly down there.

00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:27.258 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any things
so I have my baby sitter

00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:29.961 align:middle line:84%
who would have-- it was like
somewhat of a kid artist,

00:40:29.961 --> 00:40:31.429 align:middle line:90%
I said, Nancy drew their shoes."

00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:33.931 align:middle line:84%
So I went-- literally went
down, it's like in a lobby

00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:36.767 align:middle line:84%
of the Waldorf with a
shoe, a drawing of shoe.

00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:39.704 align:middle line:84%
I had a letter from
Moore Shoe [phonetic]

00:40:39.704 --> 00:40:42.173 align:middle line:84%
who actually was making
L.A. Gear shoes also saying

00:40:42.173 --> 00:40:43.641 align:middle line:84%
that they would make
their shoes for us.

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:45.276 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting there
and I said, "You know,

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:46.811 align:middle line:84%
I want to be the
official training shoe."

00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:49.747 align:middle line:84%
He goes, "Give me cheque
for 5000 dollars right now

00:40:49.747 --> 00:40:52.383 align:middle line:84%
and I'll give you
a seven year deal."

00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:53.417 align:middle line:90%
You know, boom, just like that.

00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:55.253 align:middle line:90%
I just took all the money I had.

00:40:55.253 --> 00:40:57.655 align:middle line:84%
I know it just like-- just about
the total-- my total savings.

00:40:57.655 --> 00:40:58.923 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a cheque
and gave to him.

00:40:58.923 --> 00:41:01.125 align:middle line:84%
I was like ecstatic
in the cab going back

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:04.862 align:middle line:84%
to take the shuttle back
to Boston and that sort

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:09.867 align:middle line:84%
of catapulted us to get an
underwriter who was in Denver,

00:41:09.867 --> 00:41:12.937 align:middle line:84%
all right, who there was a
female partner who owned it

00:41:12.937 --> 00:41:15.806 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And they did on this
picture of a shoe in an idea.

00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:17.041 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: What they
did with shoe and I--

00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:18.709 align:middle line:84%
my ex-wife Sherry [assumed
spelling] was the--

00:41:18.709 --> 00:41:21.712 align:middle line:84%
she's the most fantastic
sales person in the world

00:41:21.712 --> 00:41:25.483 align:middle line:84%
and we said our advertising
agency would suggest to us,

00:41:25.483 --> 00:41:27.485 align:middle line:84%
why don't you just do--
for woman by woman,

00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:29.320 align:middle line:84%
just to make it a
women's only company.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.289 align:middle line:84%
So the investment
banker was like OK.

00:41:31.289 --> 00:41:34.358 align:middle line:84%
They said to me-- you know,
start selling baby food--

00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:38.796 align:middle line:84%
you know, I would do that only
because I just like listen

00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:40.364 align:middle line:90%
to what's the next thing to do.

00:41:40.364 --> 00:41:41.732 align:middle line:84%
It's like always-- one
of the things I say

00:41:41.732 --> 00:41:42.533 align:middle line:90%
on the book it's that--

00:41:42.533 --> 00:41:43.734 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: When you meditate

00:41:43.734 --> 00:41:44.802 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: When I meditate
it's like say is a law,

00:41:44.802 --> 00:41:46.904 align:middle line:84%
instead of a law
attraction, I'm saying it,

00:41:46.904 --> 00:41:47.838 align:middle line:90%
the law of distraction.

00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:50.007 align:middle line:90%
I say just stay with yourself,

00:41:50.007 --> 00:41:53.811 align:middle line:84%
your heart already knows
what it wants and it needs.

00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:55.212 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't need any prompting.

00:41:55.212 --> 00:41:58.349 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need any visions just
listen and it will just send you

00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:00.851 align:middle line:84%
in a direction because it
really wants to give it to you.

00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:03.988 align:middle line:84%
You know that's problem one of
the biggest messages in the book

00:42:03.988 --> 00:42:05.456 align:middle line:90%
and allow, which is to happen

00:42:05.456 --> 00:42:09.026 align:middle line:84%
in its own time frame
and don't judge it.

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So we ended up taking that
company public and instantly,

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:16.067 align:middle line:84%
you know as the company goes
publicly we're both have tons

00:42:16.067 --> 00:42:19.003 align:middle line:84%
of money which we didn't
have before, and you know--

00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:20.204 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: How old
are you at this time?

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:22.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: I'm like 30.

00:42:22.273 --> 00:42:23.975 align:middle line:90%
I was like 35.

00:42:23.975 --> 00:42:25.743 align:middle line:90%
I was 35 year old.

00:42:25.743 --> 00:42:27.745 align:middle line:84%
We're both basically
the same age.

00:42:27.745 --> 00:42:30.181 align:middle line:84%
And my dream, I was, "Oh,
I just want to meditate."

00:42:30.181 --> 00:42:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's like all of a sudden,
it's like, I'm going in my room

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:35.152 align:middle line:84%
to meditate and my
ex-wife was like,

00:42:35.152 --> 00:42:36.554 align:middle line:90%
she had other things to do.

00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:37.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:42:37.555 --> 00:42:38.222 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: She didn't
have any money.

00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:39.023 align:middle line:90%
It's like, you know?

00:42:39.023 --> 00:42:40.224 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, you got--

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:42.326 align:middle line:84%
didn't have any money and
now you have tons of it.

00:42:42.326 --> 00:42:43.894 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Yeah, I had
tons of it so I was like--

00:42:43.894 --> 00:42:46.364 align:middle line:84%
but the thing that happened
is sort of like it ended

00:42:46.364 --> 00:42:49.000 align:middle line:84%
up splitting us apart 'cause she
want one way and the other way

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.068 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, we ended
up getting divorce.

00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:54.005 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, she's not
going to leave the company

00:42:54.005 --> 00:42:56.073 align:middle line:84%
because now we're basically
based the whole image

00:42:56.073 --> 00:42:59.343 align:middle line:84%
of the company around her as the
president so I was like, "Oh,

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:00.411 align:middle line:84%
just go take another
[inaudible]."

00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:01.912 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Right, yeah
a woman on company

00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:03.180 align:middle line:90%
and a product for women.

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.482 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: That's right.

00:43:04.482 --> 00:43:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And I remember
buying Ryka shoes back then

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:06.717 align:middle line:90%
because I used to run a lot.

00:43:06.717 --> 00:43:08.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah, and she--

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:10.588 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And I thought, what's
different from a woman shoe

00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:13.124 align:middle line:84%
from a man shoe but it
sounds cool, I'm buying it.

00:43:13.124 --> 00:43:14.191 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Exactly.

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:15.559 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, whatever
it is, it worked.

00:43:15.559 --> 00:43:16.827 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Exactly, it worked
great and she was on Oprah,

00:43:16.827 --> 00:43:19.764 align:middle line:84%
she was on Today's Show,
they were in People Magazine.

00:43:19.764 --> 00:43:22.967 align:middle line:84%
I was so happy, it was like
ecstatic and it's like, OK,

00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:25.069 align:middle line:90%
let me go do another company.

00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:26.203 align:middle line:90%
So I couldn't do anything woman,

00:43:26.203 --> 00:43:28.272 align:middle line:84%
so I did this men's
intercity shoe--

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:29.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I loved the poster.

00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:30.441 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah, aerial assault.

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:31.876 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah,
that you pay in it.

00:43:31.876 --> 00:43:33.077 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah, aerial assault.

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:35.446 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you
had people clamoring

00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:38.683 align:middle line:84%
for the product before
the product ever existed?

00:43:38.683 --> 00:43:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Yeah, we
were saying that,

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:42.053 align:middle line:84%
it's like earlier before
we started filming,

00:43:42.053 --> 00:43:45.322 align:middle line:84%
I was telling the story of how,
we had all the samples made

00:43:45.322 --> 00:43:49.060 align:middle line:84%
in leather jackets and hats,
you know, it's aerial assault,

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:50.394 align:middle line:90%
a big black letter assault.

00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:53.831 align:middle line:84%
It was all really edgies but
we went down into the ghetto

00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:57.001 align:middle line:84%
in New York and lay the-- all
the product out in the street,

00:43:57.001 --> 00:43:58.736 align:middle line:84%
in front of the stores 'cause
[inaudible] in the stores

00:43:58.736 --> 00:44:01.605 align:middle line:84%
when the kids go there, the gets
went literally they went crazy.

00:44:01.605 --> 00:44:03.007 align:middle line:90%
You know, looking at this stuff

00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:06.444 align:middle line:84%
that this investment banker
was standing there, looking,

00:44:06.444 --> 00:44:08.512 align:middle line:84%
you know, he was like, he
couldn't believe this one,

00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:11.348 align:middle line:84%
an older man walked up and say,
"You see that leather jacket.

00:44:11.348 --> 00:44:14.051 align:middle line:84%
If I have the [inaudible]
I'm a dead man."

00:44:14.051 --> 00:44:17.922 align:middle line:84%
I freaked out the investment
banker so much, he goes, "Whoa!"

00:44:17.922 --> 00:44:21.992 align:middle line:84%
I cannot take this company
public and so what am I going

00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:23.194 align:middle line:90%
to do-- I just listened again,

00:44:23.194 --> 00:44:25.196 align:middle line:84%
this is another example,
just listening.

00:44:25.196 --> 00:44:27.965 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I called the
United Negro College fund

00:44:27.965 --> 00:44:30.901 align:middle line:84%
and the National Urban League
and I went to them and said,

00:44:30.901 --> 00:44:34.105 align:middle line:84%
"Will you let us put
your logos on our boxes

00:44:34.105 --> 00:44:37.208 align:middle line:84%
and we'll give you five percent
of the profits of the company

00:44:37.208 --> 00:44:39.076 align:middle line:84%
to those organization
and I go, where they are?

00:44:39.076 --> 00:44:40.277 align:middle line:90%
We'll do it.

00:44:40.277 --> 00:44:42.113 align:middle line:84%
I was like shock that they
would do but I just got

00:44:42.113 --> 00:44:45.916 align:middle line:84%
that just got back just totally
from listening and that we end

00:44:45.916 --> 00:44:47.384 align:middle line:90%
up getting another underwriter

00:44:47.384 --> 00:44:49.453 align:middle line:84%
and then I took that
company public.

00:44:49.453 --> 00:44:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as that company went
public, it was sort of like,

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:55.192 align:middle line:90%
I was home free at that point.

00:44:55.192 --> 00:44:56.393 align:middle line:90%
I was like--

00:44:56.393 --> 00:44:57.561 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: As a young you
do didn't need to worry.

00:44:57.561 --> 00:44:58.863 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, that was-- yeah.

00:44:58.863 --> 00:45:00.664 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So why
did you do it again?

00:45:00.664 --> 00:45:02.233 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Well, now Id had--

00:45:02.233 --> 00:45:04.034 align:middle line:84%
after Aerial Assault
went public, I was like,

00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:05.102 align:middle line:90%
that was it, that was it for me.

00:45:05.102 --> 00:45:06.036 align:middle line:90%
I basically stopped working.

00:45:06.036 --> 00:45:09.340 align:middle line:90%
That was like, 1993.

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:11.742 align:middle line:84%
So now what ends up
happening is now--

00:45:11.742 --> 00:45:14.612 align:middle line:84%
after the second company goes
public and I'm totally retired,

00:45:14.612 --> 00:45:18.582 align:middle line:84%
I go, I'm going to build a
big, you know, mansion temple

00:45:18.582 --> 00:45:22.520 align:middle line:84%
and the statue of
Nityananda that Muktananda has

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.356 align:middle line:84%
and his [foreign language],
I'm going to get that statue

00:45:25.356 --> 00:45:29.627 align:middle line:84%
who I had young Nityananda, this
other kid make for me, you know,

00:45:29.627 --> 00:45:31.762 align:middle line:84%
had it made it for me,
the identical statue.

00:45:31.762 --> 00:45:33.431 align:middle line:90%
And I have this temple now.

00:45:33.431 --> 00:45:35.065 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well he was the
guru of Muktananda, right?

00:45:35.065 --> 00:45:36.033 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: No, no.

00:45:36.033 --> 00:45:37.168 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Or was--
were they just--

00:45:37.168 --> 00:45:38.769 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Well, he was
a guru with a same name

00:45:38.769 --> 00:45:41.005 align:middle line:84%
but when Muktananda
basically died he--

00:45:41.005 --> 00:45:43.040 align:middle line:84%
before he died he
named two successors,

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.408 align:middle line:90%
a brother and sister.

00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:47.978 align:middle line:84%
And he named the brother
Nityananda after his guru.

00:45:47.978 --> 00:45:48.546 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:45:48.546 --> 00:45:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.447 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, after
his guru, Nityananda.

00:45:50.447 --> 00:45:51.649 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: After his guru.

00:45:51.649 --> 00:45:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, 'cause I
have picture of the two.

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:54.151 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: That's right,
the young one was the one

00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:56.353 align:middle line:84%
who basically helped me end
up getting the identical,

00:45:56.353 --> 00:45:58.389 align:middle line:84%
is the same, you know, mold
and everything [inaudible].

00:45:58.389 --> 00:46:00.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It shocking
it looks identical.

00:46:00.457 --> 00:46:01.292 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Oh yes.

00:46:01.292 --> 00:46:02.493 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: If I had the picture,

00:46:02.493 --> 00:46:03.861 align:middle line:84%
I would have a hard time
telling the two apart.

00:46:03.861 --> 00:46:05.396 align:middle line:90%
The original from what you have.

00:46:05.396 --> 00:46:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: oh yeah, yeah, yes.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.065 align:middle line:90%
It's the same molds.

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:10.434 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway I have this big
example with the thing in there

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:12.503 align:middle line:84%
and now I'm like a crazy
person because it's like,

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:14.238 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make
this, you know--

00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:16.006 align:middle line:84%
my whole life, I really
wanted to get to this point

00:46:16.006 --> 00:46:17.675 align:middle line:84%
where I can just
meditate six hours a day,

00:46:17.675 --> 00:46:20.477 align:middle line:84%
and I have the statue,
and I'm like--

00:46:20.477 --> 00:46:21.979 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeding the statue 'cause

00:46:21.979 --> 00:46:23.914 align:middle line:84%
in India they really treat
those mortis like that

00:46:23.914 --> 00:46:25.182 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's
right, offerings.

00:46:25.182 --> 00:46:26.116 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: They are real.

00:46:26.116 --> 00:46:27.051 align:middle line:90%
I mean they are alive.

00:46:27.051 --> 00:46:27.952 align:middle line:84%
They feed them three
times a day.

00:46:27.952 --> 00:46:29.620 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like I'm cooking food.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.355 align:middle line:84%
I'm eating my lunch I'm
going into-- so I'm just--

00:46:31.355 --> 00:46:32.590 align:middle line:90%
I have nothing else to do.

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:34.391 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeding the statue,
I'm like--

00:46:34.391 --> 00:46:37.862 align:middle line:84%
and now I start holding
such satsang, you know,

00:46:37.862 --> 00:46:40.931 align:middle line:84%
a weekly program and then those
weekly programs, I'm getting up

00:46:40.931 --> 00:46:43.868 align:middle line:84%
and walking around and doing
what Muktananda did which is

00:46:43.868 --> 00:46:45.636 align:middle line:84%
like touching the
people that were there.

00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:47.938 align:middle line:84%
And people are having
experiences from that

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:49.306 align:middle line:84%
and I thought I'm
just listening.

00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:51.342 align:middle line:84%
This is what I should
do, you know?

00:46:51.342 --> 00:46:54.812 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not having-- my entire
experience is nothing like--

00:46:54.812 --> 00:46:57.014 align:middle line:84%
and I was thinking
though, this is going

00:46:57.014 --> 00:46:58.415 align:middle line:90%
to have an effect on me.

00:46:58.415 --> 00:46:59.683 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No.

00:46:59.683 --> 00:47:01.418 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: You know, nothing--
nothing whatsoever and--

00:47:01.418 --> 00:47:03.153 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And it just
passing on through.

00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:05.089 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: It was just passing--
it was passing on through.

00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:07.858 align:middle line:84%
And in the midst of
me doing those I was

00:47:07.858 --> 00:47:10.060 align:middle line:84%
like probably a little
bit disappointed

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:12.229 align:middle line:84%
that nothing was happening
and then, you know,

00:47:12.229 --> 00:47:13.597 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen.

00:47:13.597 --> 00:47:18.369 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden one day,
a woman shows up at my house--

00:47:18.369 --> 00:47:23.674 align:middle line:84%
a friend of a friend and her
Byron Katie and she walked in

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:27.011 align:middle line:84%
and she ended up staying
with me for the week

00:47:27.011 --> 00:47:30.180 align:middle line:84%
and she had a program
on that weekend.

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.683 align:middle line:84%
She came to my Thursday night
program and I got up and walked

00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:35.819 align:middle line:84%
around and touched her
and touch every, you know,

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:37.154 align:middle line:90%
touched everybody else,

00:47:37.154 --> 00:47:39.523 align:middle line:84%
as I'm sitting there
'cause I usually give it,

00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:43.027 align:middle line:84%
usually give a talk, in my
little speech, whatever it was,

00:47:43.027 --> 00:47:46.664 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting there going like, I
don't know what the F I'm doing.

00:47:46.664 --> 00:47:48.032 align:middle line:90%
It was just like so clear.

00:47:48.032 --> 00:47:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's what it told
you to do it so you did it.

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.235 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Yes, so I did this
or that and that's why I got

00:47:51.235 --> 00:47:54.972 align:middle line:84%
to find a room I basically said
to everybody, I don't know what,

00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:58.108 align:middle line:84%
I just like let it out I
don't know what I'm doing.

00:47:58.108 --> 00:48:00.377 align:middle line:84%
There's a woman who's
visiting us from California.

00:48:00.377 --> 00:48:01.712 align:middle line:84%
She's sitting against
the wall there.

00:48:01.712 --> 00:48:04.014 align:middle line:84%
Ask her anything
you want, you know?

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:07.017 align:middle line:84%
And the instant that I just did,
that is sort of like, through--

00:48:07.017 --> 00:48:13.023 align:middle line:84%
pass the ball to her, my mind
stop, completes stillness.

00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:15.225 align:middle line:84%
And went like that--
and we just like--

00:48:15.225 --> 00:48:17.227 align:middle line:84%
and the only thing that as
soon as the thought would come

00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:20.064 align:middle line:84%
into my mind, I just
heard the word without--

00:48:20.064 --> 00:48:21.398 align:middle line:90%
like without a thought.

00:48:21.398 --> 00:48:25.569 align:middle line:84%
I had just like this massive
believe for what I had to do

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:27.805 align:middle line:84%
or whatever is creating
or had to anything just--

00:48:27.805 --> 00:48:30.541 align:middle line:84%
it was completely taken
off my shoulders and I was

00:48:30.541 --> 00:48:34.812 align:middle line:84%
like in the state of total
freedom and then I ended up--

00:48:34.812 --> 00:48:36.213 align:middle line:90%
you know, Katie used to come

00:48:36.213 --> 00:48:39.416 align:middle line:84%
to my house all the time it's a
picture in a book of her sitting

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:41.685 align:middle line:84%
in a temple with the Nityananda
statue right behind her.

00:48:41.685 --> 00:48:44.655 align:middle line:84%
We did a number of
programs that were happened.

00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:45.889 align:middle line:90%
In those days--

00:48:45.889 --> 00:48:47.591 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So you really
kind of got her going and--

00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:48.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Well, no,
no, not-- I mean--

00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:50.661 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: In terms of
public awareness bringing a

00:48:50.661 --> 00:48:51.862 align:middle line:90%
little support.

00:48:51.862 --> 00:48:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Well, with the
only thing that, yeah--

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:54.498 align:middle line:90%
I mean I basically did pay--

00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:58.736 align:middle line:84%
just a small contribution of
paying for the initial printing

00:48:58.736 --> 00:49:00.371 align:middle line:84%
like basically loaning
the money they get.

00:49:00.371 --> 00:49:02.072 align:middle line:84%
This first book that was
written, that's not even

00:49:02.072 --> 00:49:03.540 align:middle line:84%
out there anymore, "A
Cry in the Desert."

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:49:04.942 --> 00:49:05.909 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: But, you know, Katie
would come there all the time

00:49:05.909 --> 00:49:07.878 align:middle line:84%
and was this like,
you know, we--

00:49:07.878 --> 00:49:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You were a
wonderful brother to her.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah-- yeah.

00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:12.316 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I mean, you really--
you helped each other a lot.

00:49:12.316 --> 00:49:15.285 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Yeah, so she
was-- and then, it was like--

00:49:15.285 --> 00:49:19.023 align:middle line:84%
but really it wasn't that much
reason to live in Boston anymore

00:49:19.023 --> 00:49:22.559 align:middle line:84%
so I'm like, I'm going to sell
the house and move to Sedona,

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:24.595 align:middle line:84%
you know, and I would be
close to the west cost

00:49:24.595 --> 00:49:27.164 align:middle line:84%
and Katie would come from
Manhattan beach and stay

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:31.301 align:middle line:84%
in the house in Sedona, go
back and fourth like that.

00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:37.207 align:middle line:84%
It was like great and then
I ended up meeting my wife.

00:49:37.207 --> 00:49:38.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Sweetheart Sarah.

00:49:38.375 --> 00:49:39.676 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: My Sarah.

00:49:39.676 --> 00:49:42.846 align:middle line:84%
You know, Sarah McLean in
McLean Meditation Institute.

00:49:42.846 --> 00:49:46.283 align:middle line:84%
And I met her-- she
was working for--

00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:50.020 align:middle line:84%
working for Katie and I was
like, I'm taking her to Sedona

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.289 align:middle line:84%
and then right after
I took her to Sedona,

00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:55.392 align:middle line:84%
I got Katie came and-- Kathy
and Steve and Mitchell moved

00:49:55.392 --> 00:49:57.661 align:middle line:84%
in the house right
next to us, you know?

00:49:57.661 --> 00:50:00.998 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a little bit
of party there for a year

00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:03.967 align:middle line:84%
with us all being there and
then Katie ended up going to--

00:50:03.967 --> 00:50:05.436 align:middle line:90%
moved to Ohio and do her thing.

00:50:05.436 --> 00:50:08.939 align:middle line:84%
And I was like left in, you
know, Sedona up on the hilltop

00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:10.607 align:middle line:90%
which is like-- I love it.

00:50:10.607 --> 00:50:11.708 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:50:11.708 --> 00:50:13.177 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Sedona is
just like so fantastic.

00:50:13.177 --> 00:50:13.977 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, it is.

00:50:13.977 --> 00:50:14.778 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:50:14.778 --> 00:50:16.447 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And so you had--

00:50:16.447 --> 00:50:19.049 align:middle line:84%
the financial part of
your life was behind you.

00:50:19.049 --> 00:50:20.017 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Mm-hmm.

00:50:20.017 --> 00:50:21.085 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You were
able to live off

00:50:21.085 --> 00:50:22.553 align:middle line:84%
of the investments
residuals, et cetera.

00:50:22.553 --> 00:50:23.921 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Right.

00:50:23.921 --> 00:50:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so now you had
something else that happened

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:28.859 align:middle line:84%
in this process somewhere
along the way which had to do

00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:30.327 align:middle line:90%
with your body physically.

00:50:30.327 --> 00:50:31.829 align:middle line:84%
And that was interesting
the way you've handled it.

00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:32.696 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Oh, right, right.

00:50:32.696 --> 00:50:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:34.264 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about--

00:50:34.264 --> 00:50:35.566 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Well,
I should say yeah.

00:50:35.566 --> 00:50:37.568 align:middle line:84%
So what had happened right
before I moved out to Sedona

00:50:37.568 --> 00:50:42.172 align:middle line:84%
in January of 2000, I
went down to Austin,

00:50:42.172 --> 00:50:44.274 align:middle line:84%
Texas to see my friend
Janine [assumed spelling],

00:50:44.274 --> 00:50:48.479 align:middle line:84%
my dear friend Janine and
this guy, a friend of hers

00:50:48.479 --> 00:50:51.849 align:middle line:84%
who was Pilates instructor
walked on my back, you know,

00:50:51.849 --> 00:50:53.851 align:middle line:84%
after, you know, we're all
at the party and we went back

00:50:53.851 --> 00:50:56.620 align:middle line:84%
to his house and he
looked like an S&M den

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.088 align:middle line:84%
with all those Pilates
equipment on,

00:50:58.088 --> 00:50:59.089 align:middle line:84%
lying down the thing,
it's like--

00:50:59.089 --> 00:51:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:01.592 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: -- you know,
he walks to my back

00:51:01.592 --> 00:51:03.494 align:middle line:84%
and he actually explodes my disc
which I don't know in the moment

00:51:03.494 --> 00:51:06.063 align:middle line:84%
but I found out a couple of days
later because all of a sudden,

00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:11.201 align:middle line:84%
I had this incredible pain in my
leg and between January and up

00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:15.305 align:middle line:84%
until July 4th, I got like
three epidural shots to try

00:51:15.305 --> 00:51:17.407 align:middle line:84%
to shrink my disc or
whatever, it wouldn't work.

00:51:17.407 --> 00:51:21.111 align:middle line:84%
And then on July 5th, the
day after the Fourth of July

00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:23.714 align:middle line:84%
at 6 o'clock in the
morning, I was operated on.

00:51:23.714 --> 00:51:25.916 align:middle line:90%
And to give me a discectomy,

00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:28.652 align:middle line:84%
just try to cut off the
little pieces of that disc.

00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:31.922 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter who was 18
at that time, just graduated

00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:33.857 align:middle line:84%
from high school, she dropped
me off at the hospital,

00:51:33.857 --> 00:51:37.027 align:middle line:84%
she's going to pick me up and
I come out of the surgery.

00:51:37.027 --> 00:51:40.464 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to walk out right
then that day, and when I come

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:43.267 align:middle line:84%
out of the surgery,
I'm lying in the--

00:51:43.267 --> 00:51:46.003 align:middle line:84%
what do you call
it, recovery room.

00:51:46.003 --> 00:51:48.138 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the nurse--
so how are you feeling?

00:51:48.138 --> 00:51:50.808 align:middle line:84%
How is your legs, can you
feel your legs, blah, blah?

00:51:50.808 --> 00:51:53.143 align:middle line:84%
I can't feel my right leg,
you know, I'm like, why?

00:51:53.143 --> 00:51:54.578 align:middle line:90%
I can't feel my right leg.

00:51:54.578 --> 00:51:56.613 align:middle line:84%
Finally, they got the surgeon
over there, I was like,

00:51:56.613 --> 00:51:58.081 align:middle line:84%
when is my feeling
going to come back here.

00:51:58.081 --> 00:52:00.817 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, maybe
a week, a month,

00:52:00.817 --> 00:52:02.252 align:middle line:90%
six months, whatever like that.

00:52:02.252 --> 00:52:04.121 align:middle line:84%
It's like I-- they have
to keep me in a hospital.

00:52:04.121 --> 00:52:05.856 align:middle line:90%
They had to catheterize me.

00:52:05.856 --> 00:52:07.191 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't feel anything.

00:52:07.191 --> 00:52:08.559 align:middle line:90%
I had a walker.

00:52:08.559 --> 00:52:09.927 align:middle line:90%
And now, I'm back in my--

00:52:09.927 --> 00:52:13.430 align:middle line:84%
I had sold the house I was
living temporarily and walked

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:18.135 align:middle line:84%
in an apartment and I was
just like totally devastated.

00:52:18.135 --> 00:52:20.103 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I could not--

00:52:20.103 --> 00:52:20.737 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Could you walk?

00:52:20.737 --> 00:52:21.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: -- no.

00:52:21.538 --> 00:52:22.105 align:middle line:90%
I had to like swing my leg.

00:52:22.105 --> 00:52:22.673 align:middle line:90%
I had a walker--

00:52:22.673 --> 00:52:24.074 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:52:24.074 --> 00:52:25.275 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: -- and I like swing
but it was sort of swing my leg.

00:52:25.275 --> 00:52:26.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:52:26.643 --> 00:52:28.579 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: And I was just like
what have I done, you know,

00:52:28.579 --> 00:52:30.848 align:middle line:84%
what have I done
to deserve this?

00:52:30.848 --> 00:52:32.816 align:middle line:84%
And I could always
remember Katie, I love this.

00:52:32.816 --> 00:52:34.184 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
Katie would say like,

00:52:34.184 --> 00:52:35.686 align:middle line:84%
that's like if a
woman get cancer

00:52:35.686 --> 00:52:38.188 align:middle line:84%
or people get cancer
so they come to know.

00:52:38.188 --> 00:52:41.592 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going like, well OK,
my back, I cannot feel my leg,

00:52:41.592 --> 00:52:44.361 align:middle line:84%
you know, I can't feel
everything else just so--

00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:45.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Right,
but not your leg.

00:52:45.562 --> 00:52:46.363 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: I was-- because
I tell this story a lot

00:52:46.363 --> 00:52:47.864 align:middle line:90%
of times to certain people.

00:52:47.864 --> 00:52:50.234 align:middle line:84%
I always forget to say he was
always curious about that.

00:52:50.234 --> 00:52:51.235 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, yeah.

00:52:51.235 --> 00:52:52.236 align:middle line:84%
Yeah-- no, everything
else was fine.

00:52:52.236 --> 00:52:53.637 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Everything
else is fine.

00:52:53.637 --> 00:52:58.942 align:middle line:84%
Everything else is fine so I was
so devastated and most amazing--

00:52:58.942 --> 00:53:00.177 align:middle line:90%
probably one of the most--

00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:02.212 align:middle line:84%
even more than the Kundalini
experience with So Ham

00:53:02.212 --> 00:53:06.917 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, experience
happen because I got my walker

00:53:06.917 --> 00:53:10.420 align:middle line:90%
and went out on the street.

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.055 align:middle line:84%
And when I got outside
the apartment building,

00:53:12.055 --> 00:53:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I realized like--
it was in July,

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:14.825 align:middle line:90%
I realized I couldn't get back

00:53:14.825 --> 00:53:16.927 align:middle line:84%
in because there was
a big, heavy door.

00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:19.263 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I'm trying to get
in and there's a homeless guy

00:53:19.263 --> 00:53:23.033 align:middle line:84%
that comes down kind of a big--
you know, bag of cans, you know,

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:25.402 align:middle line:84%
and a garbage bag,
and just hasn't been--

00:53:25.402 --> 00:53:27.704 align:middle line:84%
had a bath like in a year or
something like that, you know,

00:53:27.704 --> 00:53:31.241 align:middle line:84%
and he looks at me with
such love, and compassion,

00:53:31.241 --> 00:53:34.645 align:middle line:84%
and goes over and
opens the door for me.

00:53:34.645 --> 00:53:37.014 align:middle line:84%
And as I go in, pushed the
button to the elevator,

00:53:37.014 --> 00:53:40.450 align:middle line:84%
soon as I get in the elevator,
boom, I'm just like bowling.

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:43.153 align:middle line:84%
You know, I am crying
and crying--

00:53:43.153 --> 00:53:46.323 align:middle line:84%
it's like this emotional
outburst I couldn't figure out.

00:53:46.323 --> 00:53:49.960 align:middle line:84%
So next-- you know, afternoon,
I walked out of my balcony,

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.361 align:middle line:90%
the same type of thing happens.

00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:53.397 align:middle line:84%
So people upstairs although I
don't know, are yelling down,

00:53:53.397 --> 00:53:55.999 align:middle line:90%
"Hey, do you need any help?

00:53:55.999 --> 00:53:57.734 align:middle line:84%
Do you want us to
get you anything?"

00:53:57.734 --> 00:54:00.070 align:middle line:90%
you know, and I'd say--

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:01.471 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So you had
to learn the humility

00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:02.406 align:middle line:90%
that you're receiving.

00:54:02.406 --> 00:54:03.307 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Yeah,
I had to receive.

00:54:03.307 --> 00:54:04.341 align:middle line:90%
I had never received in my life.

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:05.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, right.

00:54:05.575 --> 00:54:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: So I started
meditating and I was trying

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:09.780 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what the
heck-- what was going on?

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And I-- I kept on seeing myself
as a two years old in a crib.

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:14.718 align:middle line:84%
And my mother saying,
"Marty, put your head

00:54:14.718 --> 00:54:15.852 align:middle line:90%
down and go to sleep."

00:54:15.852 --> 00:54:17.921 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I
started holding a belief

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:20.190 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't lovable, OK,

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:23.560 align:middle line:84%
from the time I was
really, really young.

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.796 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And here, all
these people are now coming

00:54:25.796 --> 00:54:29.399 align:middle line:84%
to your aid, they're loving
you, the final piece you needed

00:54:29.399 --> 00:54:30.967 align:middle line:84%
in order to find
what you wanted.

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:32.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: That's
right, that's right.

00:54:32.269 --> 00:54:36.206 align:middle line:84%
So-- and then I go out into
the hallway and I'm going

00:54:36.206 --> 00:54:38.208 align:middle line:84%
down the hall, some guy
gets off the elevator

00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and because I have
this new understanding

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:44.381 align:middle line:84%
without the thought I'm not
lovable and it was just light.

00:54:44.381 --> 00:54:46.616 align:middle line:84%
I felt like Jesus
was coming down

00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:49.486 align:middle line:84%
and I just could not take the
feel that's why really the name

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:50.654 align:middle line:84%
of the field that
love comes from is

00:54:50.654 --> 00:54:53.724 align:middle line:84%
like that field is
always there all the time.

00:54:53.724 --> 00:54:54.491 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: All of the time--

00:54:54.491 --> 00:54:55.692 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: All the time.

00:54:55.692 --> 00:54:57.961 align:middle line:84%
We can just open ourselves
to and not, you know,

00:54:57.961 --> 00:54:59.830 align:middle line:90%
and not get in the way.

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:00.964 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:01.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, we have
about one minute left.

00:55:01.631 --> 00:55:02.466 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah, OK.

00:55:02.466 --> 00:55:03.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Any final thought--

00:55:03.533 --> 00:55:04.735 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've had
one of these kind

00:55:04.735 --> 00:55:06.937 align:middle line:84%
of explosive beautiful
experiences after another.

00:55:06.937 --> 00:55:07.771 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah.

00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:08.805 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: So just in a minute,

00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:10.707 align:middle line:84%
anything you want to
leave people with?

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:14.511 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: I'd say
that we are the field,

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:16.279 align:middle line:90%
you are the field of love.

00:55:16.279 --> 00:55:20.050 align:middle line:84%
That everything that was
going on is just movement.

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:22.686 align:middle line:84%
It seems that we're sort
of in control of the doer

00:55:22.686 --> 00:55:26.156 align:middle line:84%
and I can sort of report from my
experience of raising millions

00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:29.893 align:middle line:84%
of dollars and doing everything
I did that I never was the doer,

00:55:29.893 --> 00:55:31.395 align:middle line:90%
it was just happening.

00:55:31.395 --> 00:55:34.731 align:middle line:84%
The next thing is just to be
kind because whatever that--

00:55:34.731 --> 00:55:38.001 align:middle line:84%
for me, going back up
that pathway that I gained

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:40.637 align:middle line:84%
over 35 years, you have to
be very kind to yourself.

00:55:40.637 --> 00:55:43.273 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, the main thing
we can do is just move

00:55:43.273 --> 00:55:44.541 align:middle line:90%
our attention.

00:55:44.541 --> 00:55:46.243 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
practices that you can do

00:55:46.243 --> 00:55:48.678 align:middle line:84%
for meditating to healthy
yoga to other things.

00:55:48.678 --> 00:55:51.882 align:middle line:84%
Self-inquiry, I have my own
self-inquiry thing that I do.

00:55:51.882 --> 00:55:56.319 align:middle line:84%
But I think that all people
have to do is just be kind

00:55:56.319 --> 00:55:59.189 align:middle line:84%
of themself and just move
their attention to do--

00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:01.792 align:middle line:90%
and listen to do those things.

00:56:01.792 --> 00:56:03.193 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Indeed.

00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:04.828 align:middle line:84%
Well, what a fabulous life
and you got a lot of it to go.

00:56:04.828 --> 00:56:06.897 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to see
what the next chapter--

00:56:06.897 --> 00:56:08.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Oh yeah.

00:56:08.298 --> 00:56:09.433 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- so it sounds like
maybe you're living it already.

00:56:09.433 --> 00:56:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Well, I just
want to be like that.

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.803 align:middle line:84%
my wife's center like I should
be handing Italian bread

00:56:12.803 --> 00:56:14.571 align:middle line:84%
and saying, you know,
tell me your story.

00:56:14.571 --> 00:56:15.872 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah exactly.

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:17.474 align:middle line:90%
I knew it was great bread.

00:56:17.474 --> 00:56:18.508 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: That's my next thing.

00:56:18.508 --> 00:56:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Thank you Marty.

00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:23.747 align:middle line:84%
The title of Marty's book is The
Field of Love and it's power,

00:56:23.747 --> 00:56:27.150 align:middle line:84%
love, and fortune on the road
to enlightenment as a subtitle.

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:29.386 align:middle line:84%
This is a story of a
life that is laid bare.

00:56:29.386 --> 00:56:32.255 align:middle line:84%
In the first principle as he
said as, be kind to oneself.

00:56:32.255 --> 00:56:35.559 align:middle line:84%
It's a long, intense and if
we listen, fruitful journey.

00:56:35.559 --> 00:56:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:40.096 align:middle line:84%
