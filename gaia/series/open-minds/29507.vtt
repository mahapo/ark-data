00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.900 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:20.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.160 align:middle line:84%
It is so good to see you
again, Klaus, here in Vienna.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.810 align:middle line:84%
We met at the same
time next year, right?

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.860 align:middle line:84%
This is about the time we
met you, last year, here.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.559 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:29.990 align:middle line:10%
And for the people
in our audience

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.850 align:middle line:10%
who are not familiar
with your work,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.050 align:middle line:10%
I would like you to
give us a little bit

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.430 align:middle line:10%
of background
about how you ended

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:10%
up in such a strange field.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.780 align:middle line:84%
As a-- originally, you were a
classic kind of art curator.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.590 align:middle line:90%
Or more traditional.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.530 align:middle line:84%
I should say more
traditional art curator.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And now you are a curator of
some of the strangest stuff

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.280 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:90%
And so let's talk about that.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we can start
getting into some

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.520 align:middle line:84%
of the newer discoveries
since we last spoke.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.020 align:middle line:10%
A few years ago,
exactly around 1997,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.370 align:middle line:10%
I had, together with
a friend of mine,

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.950 align:middle line:10%
the idea to bring to
Vienna, into an exhibition,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.950 align:middle line:10%
some unexplainable artifacts
from all over the world.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.370 align:middle line:84%
because when I
did overseas trips

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.220 align:middle line:84%
for my cultural exhibitions,
mainly to Japan,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I had many hours on the airplane
and also in the hotel room.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So I read many books
from famous authors

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.200 align:middle line:84%
about former civilizations,
about Atlantis,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.260 align:middle line:90%
Mu, and all these stories.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.010 align:middle line:90%
And I was a bit skeptical.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it
would be a good idea

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.050 align:middle line:84%
to bring all or many of
these unexplainable artifacts

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.480 align:middle line:84%
to Vienna, and show it in
an exhibition to the public,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.690 align:middle line:84%
and give the science the chance
to check on these artifacts,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.980 align:middle line:84%
if they are real, or frauds,
or imitations, or whatsoever.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.080 align:middle line:84%
How did you even come
about the actual artifacts?

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's one thing to
read about lost civilizations,

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:84%
but how did you actually
come about the artifacts,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.160 align:middle line:90%
the original artifacts?

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.320 align:middle line:90%
We researched.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.260 align:middle line:10%
Only at the beginning, we
researched only artifacts

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.950 align:middle line:10%
which are in museums worldwide.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.970 align:middle line:10%
REGINA MEREDITH: OK.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Where there was not a really
explanation about them.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine,
a museum director,

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.700 align:middle line:84%
he wrote to all his
colleagues around the world

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.080 align:middle line:84%
and asked if we might be able
to lend some of these articles

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:90%
for the exhibition in Vienna.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And one and a half years of
work after, that was just

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:84%
one and a half year
before the planned opening

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:84%
of the exhibition,
we received all

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.380 align:middle line:90%
the answers from the museums.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And out of 356 requests,
we got only the acceptance

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.700 align:middle line:90%
of one museum, of one artifact.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.660 align:middle line:90%
So all off friends, of course--

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Not much of an exhibit
with one artifact.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.180 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.330 align:middle line:84%
So everybody-- everybody
around us told us,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.130 align:middle line:84%
so you better give up because
in one and a half year,

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.730 align:middle line:84%
what would you do, if you
have only one artifact?

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:90%
How many do you need?

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.018 align:middle line:84%
And we planned, originally,
showing about 200,

00:03:25.018 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:90%
up to 220, pieces.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And from that moment on, we
started to research by ourself

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.030 align:middle line:84%
through internet,
through telephone,

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:84%
through several trips to South
America, to United States,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.200 align:middle line:90%
in Europe to some places.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And finally, at the opening
on 21st of June, 2001,

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.610 align:middle line:84%
we could show 470 pieces.
-Oh.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Now did you have to get these
from private owners, private

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.500 align:middle line:90%
collections from the most part?

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.850 align:middle line:84%
From some small museums,
which we found especially

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.290 align:middle line:84%
in South America, but
majority of these pieces

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.970 align:middle line:84%
from private collections.
-Mm.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:90%
That's quite a feat.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just that
you had people.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:84%
I guess your friend that you
were speaking about, the person

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:84%
you're doing this with, that
even knew who to contact

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.380 align:middle line:84%
for these private
collections is pretty amazing

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.557 align:middle line:90%
in and of itself.

00:04:18.557 --> 00:04:19.390 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: I would say--

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.440 align:middle line:90%
This is not well known.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.800 align:middle line:84%
I would say we had
a lot of good luck.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And there were so many
coincidences, which just

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.530 align:middle line:90%
brought us all these pieces.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean we planned 200, 220.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.740 align:middle line:84%
But finally, a little bit before
the opening of the exhibition,

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.464 align:middle line:90%
we had the acceptance of 470.

00:04:38.464 --> 00:04:39.530 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: That's amazing.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:90%
So we couldn't refuse.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So the whole budget, of course,
exploded because we needed

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.900 align:middle line:84%
more transportation costs,
backing costs, more showcases,

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.400 align:middle line:90%
more lighting, and everything.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:90%
But it was worthwhile.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, this had to have been
not a freak show by any means,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.280 align:middle line:84%
but one of the strangest
collections of artifacts

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:84%
ever assembled,
especially in that kind

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:90%
of-- in those numbers.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And let's go back into
what you had to gathered.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.747 align:middle line:84%
Some of the stranger-- these are
all unexplained, pretty much?

00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Most of these were
unexplained items.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: Most of these.
Most of these.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.221 align:middle line:84%
They have no scientific
explanation, at this point,

00:05:16.221 --> 00:05:16.920 align:middle line:90%
behind them.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.753 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: That's right.

00:05:17.753 --> 00:05:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about a few
of those original items

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:84%
that still kind of blow
your mind to this day.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.260 align:middle line:84%
For example, one very
strange collection

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.770 align:middle line:84%
we found in Ecuador, in a
small place called La Mana.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I heard about the finding
of over 300 pieces

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:84%
which do not fit
any South American,

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:90%
pre-Columbian culture.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Found there while gold
digging in a tunnel system

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.810 align:middle line:84%
by an Ecuadorian engineer,
Engineer Sotomayor.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And through a friend,
through an Austrian friend,

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.270 align:middle line:84%
we got the contact,
through his brother,

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.260 align:middle line:90%
to the owner of this collection.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.410 align:middle line:90%
And we visited his place.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw these
pieces, I was just

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.670 align:middle line:84%
shocked because
many of the pieces

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.901 align:middle line:84%
have precise inlays,
colorful inlays.

00:06:09.901 --> 00:06:11.511 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Oh.
Very precise inlays.

00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
-Yes.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And you see the colors,
of course, on daylight.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:84%
But later on in the
evening, the owner

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.920 align:middle line:84%
brought some of these
pieces on the table

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.070 align:middle line:90%
and he closed the light.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.110 align:middle line:90%
And we were surprised.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:90%
We thought, what's going on now?

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And then he brought a black
light lamp, ultraviolet lamp.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And all the colors, the
inlays in these pieces,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.080 align:middle line:84%
were glowing and
shining very strong.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And the most interesting
piece there was a pyramid.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:52.220 align:middle line:84%
The shape like Egyptian pyramid,
but flat, made out in stone.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.180 align:middle line:90%
And 13 steps in carvings.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.090 align:middle line:90%
And on top, an eye.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And the eye-- the
color of the eye

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.560 align:middle line:90%
was gray, light gray, dark gray.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.610 align:middle line:84%
But when he should brought
the black light-- when

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.665 align:middle line:84%
he showed it on the
black light, the eye

00:07:11.665 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:90%
was glowing very strong.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like there
is one star constellation

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000 align:middle line:84%
photo from NASA, which is called
The Eye of God or God's Eye.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.399 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Oh.
God's Eye.

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And this inlay, the shining of
this eye, looks quite similar,

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.480 align:middle line:90%
I would say.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Any-- is there any idea,
whatsoever, of how old

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:90%
that artifact may have been?

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.431 align:middle line:84%
Stone Age dating is
the big difficulty.

00:07:40.431 --> 00:07:42.040 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-The big problem.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.483 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:43.483 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Because it's-- it
doesn't succumb

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.620 align:middle line:84%
to the standard procedure
of carbon dating, right?

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:90%
With bones and other things.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:56.990 align:middle line:84%
But one thing, if we talk about
none pre-Columbian cultures,

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:02.140 align:middle line:84%
the oldest one is in the
Ecuadorian Valdivia culture.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.860 align:middle line:90%
And it goes back about 4,000 BC.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:90%
That means 6,000 years.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.890 align:middle line:84%
So if all these pieces have
no connection to any known

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:16.380 align:middle line:84%
pre-Columbian, South
American culture,

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.390 align:middle line:84%
the pieces should be at
least older than 6,000 years.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.757 align:middle line:90%
And very sophisticated.

00:08:22.757 --> 00:08:23.790 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Very sophisticated.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.020 align:middle line:90%
In their artwork.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:90%
Very sophisticated.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are so precise that
when we showed them, the most

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:35.289 align:middle line:84%
interesting ones, in Vienna,
some specialists in stone

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:38.299 align:middle line:84%
working, they said it would
be even difficult to do

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:41.012 align:middle line:90%
the same thing in our days.

00:08:41.012 --> 00:08:43.059 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA (VIDEO PLAYBACK):
A big stone cup found together

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:46.980 align:middle line:90%
with twelve little stone cups.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.090 align:middle line:84%
On the big cup, you
have in carvings

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.560 align:middle line:90%
of a star constellation.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And the cup inside is very
magnetical on the outside only

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.730 align:middle line:84%
in the center of the three
stones building a pyramid.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is, concerning
[INAUDIBLE], Impossible.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Because if a stone has metal
material inside the stone,

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.840 align:middle line:84%
it must be same magnetical
from both sides.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.790 align:middle line:90%
This cup is different.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And to say nothing
of this substance

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.030 align:middle line:90%
that glows in the dark.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.941 align:middle line:84%
Has-- have you figured
out what that is yet?

00:09:25.941 --> 00:09:26.640 align:middle line:90%
Has anyone--

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:34.100 align:middle line:84%
What we think, it was
some illuminating crystals.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.430 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Illuminating crystals.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:90%
That they made it like powder.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And they used some glue or
any material to make it hard

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and put it exactly in
the in carving lines.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.220 align:middle line:90%
But light emitting crystals?

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.480 align:middle line:90%
They're existing.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Precious stones or
semi precious stones,

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.698 align:middle line:84%
if you put black light on them,
they are shining very strong.

00:10:02.698 --> 00:10:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.810 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And you did a video.
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.983 align:middle line:90%
A DVD.

00:10:09.983 --> 00:10:11.220 align:middle line:84%
[COMPUTER BEEPING]
Actually.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.010 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: Yes.
Yes.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.576 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: That's
absolutely fascinating.

00:10:13.576 --> 00:10:16.190 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the DVD,
obviously, and, I mean,

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.600 align:middle line:84%
we were just enthralled
throughout because,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:84%
again, no one has ever
seen these items before.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.350 align:middle line:84%
We're unlikely to ever come in
contact with them personally.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And so you've done us all
the service of putting this

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.500 align:middle line:84%
together, traveling around
to these various collections,

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.460 align:middle line:90%
and putting it in a DVD format.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.440 align:middle line:84%
So certainly, anybody that has
a chance to watch that DVD,

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.353 align:middle line:90%
I highly recommend it.

00:10:38.353 --> 00:10:39.752 align:middle line:84%
-Thank you.
-OK.

00:10:39.752 --> 00:10:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So there were some
others as well.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it seemed to
be astronomically oriented.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.990 align:middle line:90%
Many of them.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.050 align:middle line:84%
For example, there is, also
in the same collection,

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:55.051 align:middle line:84%
there is a big jade cup
and twelve little cups.

00:10:55.051 --> 00:10:55.750 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And in the big cup, there
is an inlay of a precise star

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.650 align:middle line:90%
constellation.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And in the little ones, you
have in carvings of numbers.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And the numbers are looking
like the Mayan numbers,

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.520 align:middle line:90%
but with a little difference.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.940 align:middle line:90%
So very interesting.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.620 align:middle line:84%
But for me, the most
interesting thing

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.255 align:middle line:90%
was the pyramid with the eye.

00:11:18.255 --> 00:11:19.010 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Because on the
bottom of this pyramid

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.520 align:middle line:84%
was the inlay of the Orion
constellation in little gold

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.900 align:middle line:90%
plates and an unknown writing.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So after receiving--
after making the photos

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:39.560 align:middle line:84%
and showing some of the pictures
to one gentlemen, one professor

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.380 align:middle line:84%
in Germany-- his name
was Kurt Schildmann--

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and he was the president of
The German Language society.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And he spoke, and wrote, and
read more than 40 languages.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.710 align:middle line:84%
It's inconceivable,
but wonderful.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And he did research on
the Hindus warrior writing.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.407 align:middle line:84%
And also on the Easter
Island writings.

00:12:04.407 --> 00:12:05.440 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Easter Island.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said that there
is a light similarity

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:15.445 align:middle line:84%
between those-- this
writing from South America,

00:12:15.445 --> 00:12:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and the Hindus warrior, and
the Easter Island writings.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And finally, he could decipher
the writing, the explanation

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.470 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of the pyramid.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was writing the
son of the creator comes.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.095 align:middle line:90%
That was his translation.

00:12:33.095 --> 00:12:35.870 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And later on, we
found other artifacts

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.390 align:middle line:90%
in Colombia, in Ecuador.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.015 align:middle line:84%
In the United States,
in Illinois, there

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:47.850 align:middle line:84%
is a famous story
going around about

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.110 align:middle line:90%
the so called the Burrows Cave.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:50.810 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the Burrows Cave.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.467 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: I fully believe in
the originality of the pieces.

00:12:56.467 --> 00:12:57.600 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
The authenticity.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.299 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:58.299 --> 00:13:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I fully believe in it because
otherwise, Professor Schildmann

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.110 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have been able
to translate also some

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.260 align:middle line:90%
of those stones from Illinois.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And we found the same
writing in Glozel.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:16.630 align:middle line:84%
In Glozel, 1940-- 1924, a
farmer found, on his ground,

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:21.040 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of stones and
bones with in carvings

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.167 align:middle line:90%
with the same writing.

00:13:22.167 --> 00:13:23.400 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Where is this again?

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Glozel in France.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.980 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: In France.
Yes.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:26.800 align:middle line:84%
OK.
-Yes.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And still, until
today-- it was 1924.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Still, until today, the official
French science does not accept

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.370 align:middle line:90%
those pieces as authenticity--

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:40.720 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Authentic.
-Authentic.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
same writing, you're

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:84%
saying, that was on the
bottom of the little pyramid

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:46.807 align:middle line:90%
with the glowing eye.

00:13:46.807 --> 00:13:48.040 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: Exactly
the same writing.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Deposited all over the planet.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:55.020 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: Later on, we found
pieces in Calabria in Italy,

00:13:55.020 --> 00:14:01.760 align:middle line:84%
in Malta, Mediterranean
island, in Turkmenistan,

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.480 align:middle line:90%
and even in Australia.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.450 align:middle line:84%
That means there
must have existed

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.230 align:middle line:84%
a global civilization
or a civilization which

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.970 align:middle line:90%
had global contact in the past.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Meaning they needed
to move around.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.486 align:middle line:84%
They were able to get around.
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:14:16.486 --> 00:14:17.910 align:middle line:84%
They got around.
KLAUS DONA: Or--

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.040 align:middle line:90%
Or they came from elsewhere.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Or, for example, you have a
famous writing in the Bible.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:29.980 align:middle line:84%
For example, until the
building up the tower of Babel,

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.270 align:middle line:84%
there was a-- they all
spoke only one language.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.050 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.250 align:middle line:84%
But for the official
science, it's

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:42.350 align:middle line:84%
difficult to accept this writing
because they say that it is

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:49.220 align:middle line:84%
a mixture of different old
writings, like Greek writings,

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:90%
like Rome's, and others.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.140 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.280 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at this,
then this-- and I want to go

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:90%
back to Burrows Cave in a bit.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.750 align:middle line:84%
But along this
trajectory, then we

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:06.830 align:middle line:84%
have to be assigning
a common civilization

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.560 align:middle line:90%
very, very, very far back.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're going
back as far as what

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:90%
was known as Mu or Lemuria.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.910 align:middle line:90%
That's what I think so.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
collection of La Mana,

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:25.380 align:middle line:84%
there was also a 350
kilo granite rock.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.950 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA (VIDEO PLAYBACK): And
you have a natural white quartz

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.860 align:middle line:90%
line going around the stone.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And all the continents
and countries

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:39.180 align:middle line:84%
are in carved and inlayed
with a red material.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So you can see here
that approximately where

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Israel or the near east is.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Showing Europe, showing United
States, part of South America,

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.290 align:middle line:90%
Asia.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And there are two
continents in carved

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:01.500 align:middle line:84%
which do not exist in this
style or even not exist today.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.770 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: In this day.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.336 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA (VIDEO PLAYBACK):
Here, for example,

00:16:04.336 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:84%
you see the quartz line is
passing the Atlantic Ocean.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.410 align:middle line:10%
And you see a
continent, which means

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:16.830 align:middle line:10%
that must be the so-called
sunken continent Mu.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:20.511 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: And Japan also
is not showing like today.

00:16:20.511 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.790 align:middle line:84%
It's showing from the
northest Japanese islands,

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.530 align:middle line:90%
now belonging to Russia.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Far down Taiwan, there's
a long continent.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And you know that outside
the southest Japanese island,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Yonaguni, very close
to Taiwan, they

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:45.390 align:middle line:84%
found, in the 1980s,
human made, big, stone

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:48.010 align:middle line:90%
structures under the sea level.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:49.280 align:middle line:90%
That means very [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.947 align:middle line:84%
And does that have to do with
Graham Hancock's explorations

00:16:51.947 --> 00:16:53.610 align:middle line:84%
at all?
Do you know?

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:54.980 align:middle line:90%
Is it one and the same.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.491 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: Graham--
that's Yonaguni.

00:16:56.491 --> 00:16:57.190 align:middle line:90%
Yonaguni, yeah.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.991 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: And Graham Hancock
wrote about it in his books.

00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:00.690 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: And he
got also contact

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.280 align:middle line:90%
with Professor Masaaki Kimura.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:11.310 align:middle line:84%
That's a Japanese,
undersea geologist who

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.440 align:middle line:90%
does all of these researches.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And Professor Kimura
came to Vienna

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.940 align:middle line:84%
for the opening of
our exhibition, 2001,

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:23.980 align:middle line:84%
because he lended us the model
of the biggest structure,

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.200 align:middle line:90%
under sea structure.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And he also lended
us two artifacts

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:36.030 align:middle line:84%
he found next to this stone
structure under the sea level.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Now is the supposition
that may have been part

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:42.280 align:middle line:90%
of the lost continent of Mu?

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.730 align:middle line:90%
For me, it looks like.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.500 align:middle line:90%
And I got many informations.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:53.200 align:middle line:84%
For example, from Mongolia, they
found pieces made out of jade.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Very strange pieces.

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:58.060 align:middle line:84%
But for me, the most
interesting piece,

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:02.210 align:middle line:84%
which is now in a family
collection since hundreds

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:05.550 align:middle line:84%
of years in Macao, in
China-- I received,

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.830 align:middle line:90%
from the family, many photos.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And there is one-- one
piece made out of bronze.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.080 align:middle line:90%
A bronze statue.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw this
picture, first I thought,

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.870 align:middle line:84%
they sent me a piece from
Egypt because it's exactly

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.410 align:middle line:90%
showing Isis, the Goddess Isis.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:27.840 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
The Goddess Isis.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.539 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:28.539 --> 00:18:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And there a lot of
researchers, already 200 years

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.320 align:middle line:84%
ago-- 150 years,
200 years ago, they

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.040 align:middle line:84%
researched on the so-called
sunken continent Mu.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:42.860 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And there was a British
Colonel in India.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And he did a lot of
research in India.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And he found, in a temple, some
plates with unknown writing.

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And the monks helped
him to translate it.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was talking about the
sinking of the continent Mu.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And for me, many
of the artifacts

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:84%
are showing a route
from the Pacific Ocean

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.790 align:middle line:84%
through Japan, through
China, down to India,

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.550 align:middle line:90%
and further on to Egypt.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:23.260 align:middle line:10%
And on the other way,
from the Atlantic Ocean,

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.856 align:middle line:10%
Atlantis-- the so-called
Atlantis civilization.

00:19:25.856 --> 00:19:26.610 align:middle line:10%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.600 align:middle line:10%
KLAUS DONA: Atlantis continent.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:10%
There is a route showing
to South America, Mexico,

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.250 align:middle line:10%
but on the other hand,
also to Western Africa.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:36.950 align:middle line:10%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.570 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: And then
further on to Egypt.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Egypt.
Yes.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So why the Egyptian
culture suddenly appeared

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.300 align:middle line:90%
in such a precise style?

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:90%
Or even the Sumerian?

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.180 align:middle line:90%
6,000 years.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.257 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, they started
with mathematics--

00:19:54.257 --> 00:19:55.090 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Exactly.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:20:00.240 align:middle line:84%
With astronomy and
many other knowledge.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.127 align:middle line:90%
Everything suddenly.

00:20:02.127 --> 00:20:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is very strange.
-Yes.

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:03.849 align:middle line:90%
It is strange.

00:20:03.849 --> 00:20:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And the esoteric thought on
that already is out there.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.080 align:middle line:84%
But again, people
are just trying

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.220 align:middle line:90%
to piece things together.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.690 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily
have scientific basis

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.880 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of it, but there
is other mythological basis.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Ancient texts, rare
texts, and interpretations

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.880 align:middle line:84%
would piece it together that
Egypt, the Egyptian culture,

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.480 align:middle line:90%
was simply an extension.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was a much
more ancient Egypt,

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian culture, than
what we know of now.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.160 align:middle line:84%
It was simply an extension
of the Atlantian culture

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.310 align:middle line:84%
as some of the
people from Atlantis

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.100 align:middle line:84%
actually bridged
over into Egypt.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and for Mu, it
would make-- why wouldn't it

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.660 align:middle line:84%
make sense that would have
a very similar phenomena?

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And then looking at
it from that level,

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.790 align:middle line:84%
I always find it curious
that even in the Bible,

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.131 align:middle line:84%
right, it speaks of
the Tower of Babel.

00:20:52.131 --> 00:20:52.830 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And it speaks of
the people being

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.930 align:middle line:84%
separated to various
places all over the planet.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.290 align:middle line:84%
But I never heard
anyone actually

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.360 align:middle line:84%
look at the dynamics of
how those people were

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.200 align:middle line:90%
placed elsewhere.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Because really, what's coming
up to me in these themes,

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.340 align:middle line:84%
if we're looking at
Mu-- we're going to get

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.690 align:middle line:90%
into some of this in a bit.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Things that are way out of
place from where we have--

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:90%
They supposedly originated.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Very heavy items that really,
realistically, didn't come over

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.520 align:middle line:90%
certainly in dugout canoes.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at the
phenomenon of space travel.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.520 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at the phenomena
of ancient extraterrestrial

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.261 align:middle line:84%
cultures that have probably been
around and doing quite a bit

00:21:33.261 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle line:90%
throughout time.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And we've-- we've spoken about
that in other interviews.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:41.000 align:middle line:84%
But what struck me is
that the Babel phenomena,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.070 align:middle line:84%
is that if you have
aircraft, you can simply

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:49.010 align:middle line:84%
transport large portions of
populations to other areas

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.020 align:middle line:90%
and deposit them.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.421 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's certainly
within possibility.

00:21:52.421 --> 00:21:53.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a poss--

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.670 align:middle line:84%
We just don't ever
ask the questions.

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is a lot
of it sitting right

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.950 align:middle line:84%
there, you find, in
plain sight to be asked,

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:01.030 align:middle line:90%
but we just don't ask?

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:04.040 align:middle line:90%


00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Because what could
not be, should not be.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.230 align:middle line:90%
That's always a big explanation.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are so many
things all over the world.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:19.330 align:middle line:84%
If the official science would
accept some of the pieces which

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.580 align:middle line:90%
I've found all over the world--

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:22.770 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.630 align:middle line:84%
They must re-write
human history.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's resistant
to this kind of change,

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:33.320 align:middle line:84%
especially if you're left
hanging there with no tools

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.830 align:middle line:84%
to be able to decipher
how this happened.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:37.490 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be where
things get hung up.

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.530 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
part to it, too.

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do
with sheer commerce.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about that a little later.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.035 align:middle line:84%
But now that we've kind
of gone off on that,

00:22:45.035 --> 00:22:47.950 align:middle line:84%
that side track, a bit, let's
get back to Burrows Cave

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.420 align:middle line:90%
because this is one example.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Burrows Cave wrote a book.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk
about where it is,

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and what's been found
there, and everything.

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:55.940 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:59.440 align:middle line:84%
It's found in Illinois.
-In America.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.630 align:middle line:84%
If look today,
into the internet,

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:06.570 align:middle line:84%
90% of the writings
you find is saying

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.400 align:middle line:90%
that the whole story is fraud.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.280 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: A hoax.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:09.980 align:middle line:90%
The usual story.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a hoax.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's difficult
to believe that it's

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:20.590 align:middle line:84%
a hoax because how
could someone decipher

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:25.920 align:middle line:84%
or read a writing which
officially does not exist?

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And Professor Schildmann, he
passed away a few years ago,

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.530 align:middle line:90%
in the age of 94.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And he was translating some
of the Burrows Cave stones.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.760 align:middle line:10%
And it was talking
about Jupiter,

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:44.870 align:middle line:10%
Venus, flying objects, big
catastrophes, and such stories.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:50.750 align:middle line:10%
A man in the age of
85 up to over 90,

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:55.834 align:middle line:10%
he's not interested in writing
about fantastic or fraud--

00:23:55.834 --> 00:23:56.800 align:middle line:10%
REGINA MEREDITH: Fairy tales.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Fairy tales or
something like that.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.520 align:middle line:84%
He was a serious,
German scholar.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.780 align:middle line:90%
He was very serious.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And there is another
man living until today,

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:09.310 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully
several more years.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a Italian professor.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And in Calabria, a land owner
found after a heavy stone--

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:23.320 align:middle line:84%
he found ceramic plates
and artifacts on his ground

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:27.530 align:middle line:84%
with exactly the same
writing like on Burrows Cave.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And there was a big
plate, ceramic plate,

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:37.820 align:middle line:84%
and this professor in Italy
received all the photos.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And he could
translate the writing

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.410 align:middle line:90%
on the big, ceramic plate.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was explaining a
place in the southern Italy

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:54.140 align:middle line:84%
where there is a little
stone circle, where there is

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:59.440 align:middle line:84%
a mastodon, a
pre-historic elephant,

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.350 align:middle line:84%
statue out of--
made out of stone.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And in this area, there are
the graves of the sea kings.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:10.980 align:middle line:90%
The sea kings?

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.350 align:middle line:90%
The sea kings.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:15.150 align:middle line:84%
The translation was
talking about the graves

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:17.130 align:middle line:90%
of the sea kings.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And an Italian publisher of
an archaeological magazine,

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.680 align:middle line:84%
very serious man,
Adriano Forgione,

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:30.490 align:middle line:84%
he found, on the
translation, the stone

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:84%
circle, the mastodon statue--
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.620 align:middle line:90%
Made out of stone.

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Very old because it's
already nearly destroyed,

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:84%
but still you can see it's
not showing an elephant.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.280 align:middle line:90%
It's showing a mastodon.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.889 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
From another age.

00:25:46.889 --> 00:25:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And the area-- the area of the
graves because they did ground

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.930 align:middle line:84%
penetrate radar
research on spot.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And they found tunnel and
anomalies underground.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:04.781 align:middle line:84%
But they did not receive
the allowance to excavate.

00:26:04.781 --> 00:26:05.780 align:middle line:84%
The permissions.
KLAUS DONA: Yeah.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.390 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't go
in and excavate it.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Now this is, again,
you're Calabria?

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.890 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: In Calabria.
-Yeah.

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:11.589 align:middle line:90%
Italy.

00:26:11.589 --> 00:26:13.540 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: So how
can you find places

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:19.240 align:middle line:84%
describe on a fraud plate
in a non existing language?

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.710 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's impossible.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:21.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.510 align:middle line:90%
So many coincidence?

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:24.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe that's possible.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, now there so
many that we're really

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.640 align:middle line:84%
having to, in all
fairness, take it out

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.017 align:middle line:90%
of the realm of coincidence.

00:26:31.017 --> 00:26:32.550 align:middle line:84%
There's something-- and
there's another story.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:34.820 align:middle line:84%
There's something else that's
been going on all along.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:35.720 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: I think so.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm just going
back one more time.

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.460 align:middle line:84%
What did they find
in Burrows Cave?

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.100 align:middle line:84%
What was supposedly--
and I know Philip Coppens

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.450 align:middle line:84%
has written about this as well.
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:45.790 align:middle line:84%
We've interviewed Philip, so
we can look some of his work.

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.110 align:middle line:84%
But tell us what you
know was found there.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:53.420 align:middle line:84%
What I know was found there
were gold artifacts, thousands

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:57.650 align:middle line:84%
of stones with these
unknown in carvings,

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:03.520 align:middle line:84%
but also showing faces,
profiles, of human

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.510 align:middle line:84%
from different continents,
like black people,

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:12.220 align:middle line:84%
like Asian peoples, like
South American peoples.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:16.080 align:middle line:84%
So just things
which is incredibly.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.980 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: That are
not native to that region.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.829 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Definitely not.
Definitely not.

00:27:19.829 --> 00:27:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the
person who found

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.757 align:middle line:84%
this, all these artifacts,
Burrows himself.

00:27:24.757 --> 00:27:25.590 align:middle line:90%
And when did this happen?

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:26.523 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Russell Burrows.

00:27:26.523 --> 00:27:28.030 align:middle line:90%
I met him 2001.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.350 align:middle line:10%
He brought some of his
findings, some of his stones,

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.780 align:middle line:10%
to the exhibition to Vienna.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And he did, also, a
speech in a conference.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And he explained-- and he wrote
a book about Burrows Cave.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:46.850 align:middle line:84%
He explained that he found,
also, over man sized statues

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:51.190 align:middle line:84%
with precious stones inside,
that he found small chambers

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:52.660 align:middle line:90%
with sarcophagus--

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.610 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Small
what with sarcophagus?

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:55.050 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: Statues.
REGINA MEREDITH: Statues.

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:56.709 align:middle line:84%
OK.
KLAUS DONA: Statues.

00:27:56.709 --> 00:27:58.680 align:middle line:10%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.860 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Sarcophagus.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.240 align:middle line:90%
Sarcophagus.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.654 align:middle line:84%
In Illinois.
In a cave.

00:28:02.654 --> 00:28:03.620 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Made out of gold.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Made out of gold.
Oh, of course.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the big
question is, how

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:12.980 align:middle line:84%
can you bring gold sarcophagus,
which must be very, very heavy,

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.250 align:middle line:84%
inside an underground
tunnel system?

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.150 align:middle line:90%
That's a very big question.

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Then he explained that he
also found some papyrus rolls.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:23.970 align:middle line:90%
Some papyrus.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:24.700 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Papyrus.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.960 align:middle line:90%
Papyrus rolls?

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.720 align:middle line:90%
Scrolls.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.430 align:middle line:90%
Scrolls.

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
something very interesting

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:35.800 align:middle line:84%
for me because that might give
us informations about where

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.530 align:middle line:90%
those pieces came from.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.080 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Has-- has
anyone seen the scrolls?

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:40.950 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:41.883 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: He hasn't--

00:28:41.883 --> 00:28:43.920 align:middle line:90%
He only was talking about.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.760 align:middle line:84%
He-- does he have
access to them or--

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.870 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: I have no idea.
-I don't know.

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:50.280 align:middle line:84%
We don't know.
KLAUS DONA: I have no idea.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Oh, OK.
I mean, yes.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:84%
It would be absolutely
fascinating to see

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:54.300 align:middle line:90%
what's on them.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.190 align:middle line:84%
But again, you say that
the writing that was

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.090 align:middle line:84%
on some of those artifacts--
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:00.451 align:middle line:84%
Was the same as the other
you were speaking about,

00:29:00.451 --> 00:29:01.150 align:middle line:90%
this unknown.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:02.683 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: Which we
found all over the world.

00:29:02.683 --> 00:29:04.881 align:middle line:84%
That possibly an original
language of Mu or something.

00:29:04.881 --> 00:29:05.580 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can-- it's just
theoretical at this time.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:11.950 align:middle line:84%
So if all these
pieces are fraud,

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:19.980 align:middle line:84%
there must have been a guy or
some guys already before 1924

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:23.390 align:middle line:84%
because the first
official finding

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.685 align:middle line:90%
was in Glozel in France.

00:29:25.685 --> 00:29:27.790 align:middle line:90%
Of the same writing.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Already before 1924, doing
some fakes or frauds,

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:36.300 align:middle line:84%
and bringing them from
Australia to the United States,

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.600 align:middle line:84%
to South America, to
Europe, and hide it,

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and hope that someday
someone finds it,

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:45.670 align:middle line:90%
and get headache, what this is?

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.890 align:middle line:84%
That would be quite an
endeavor to undertake just

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:52.630 align:middle line:84%
for the sake of pulling off
one big hoax at some point

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.184 align:middle line:90%
later in the future.

00:29:54.184 --> 00:29:55.450 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: Would
have been difficult.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:57.180 align:middle line:84%
It would have been
very difficult.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.204 align:middle line:84%
And we have many, many
more things to talk about.

00:29:59.204 --> 00:30:00.870 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take just
a little break right now,

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:84%
and come back, and
talk about some

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.140 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramids that
have been found,

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.940 align:middle line:84%
that are in places that have
not been previously suspected.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.344 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:30:09.344 --> 00:30:12.236 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:12.236 --> 00:30:16.481 align:middle line:90%


00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:20.540 align:middle line:10%
We were talking with Klaus
about some phenomenal artifacts,

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.930 align:middle line:10%
a little bit earlier, that
contain a language that

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.580 align:middle line:10%
has been lost for a very long
period of time that may even

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.400 align:middle line:10%
have come from an original
language of earth people

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.230 align:middle line:10%
from the lost continent of Mu.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.620 align:middle line:84%
But again, this is just
theory at this point.

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:37.930 align:middle line:84%
We're all just looking to
slowly, but surely reveal

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:39.410 align:middle line:90%
our own history to ourselves.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really, that's
what this is all about.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.271 align:middle line:84%
And whatever other
history is here as well.

00:30:43.271 --> 00:30:43.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And probably the largest
icons to a past time

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:51.160 align:middle line:90%
have to be pyramids.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we're going
to be heading to Bosnia.

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And we're going there because
of the Bosnian Pyramid.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.671 align:middle line:10%
You've already been
to this pyramid.

00:30:58.671 --> 00:30:59.370 align:middle line:10%
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:02.010 align:middle line:10%
REGINA MEREDITH: And I would
like you to maybe just share

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:03.700 align:middle line:10%
a little bit about
the pyramid itself,

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.630 align:middle line:10%
what you find
particularly phenomenal.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And then about some
explorations beyond.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:15.580 align:middle line:10%
I got an invitation last year,
September, to a conference

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.360 align:middle line:10%
to Visoko, to the place
of the Bosnian pyramids.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.750 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Outside of Sarajevo.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:23.250 align:middle line:90%
From a Professor Osmangic.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw the
list of speakers,

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I saw that there are
nine or 10 scientists.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.290 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, who?

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And I come with my
unexplainable artifacts.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.580 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to get
some validation

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:38.880 align:middle line:90%
on some of your artifacts.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:45.970 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have artifacts,
I only lended for research

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.160 align:middle line:90%
or for the exhibition.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:47.890 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So what I did, I made a
PowerPoint presentation.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.470 align:middle line:84%
But I have a very
good friend in Germany

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and he invented
a new technology.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, can
you do me the favor

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and try to make a scan over
the so called The Sun Pyramid,

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.150 align:middle line:90%
officially just a mountain?

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:13.810 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: The Sun Pyramid
in Bosnia, which the Egyptians

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:16.160 align:middle line:84%
are saying, impossible.
It's a fake.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:16.864 align:middle line:90%
It's just a mountain.

00:32:16.864 --> 00:32:17.630 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Definitely.

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:18.880 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: That's the--
that's the official word,

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.430 align:middle line:84%
is it's a hoax right now.
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.860 align:middle line:84%
It's-- if you look
into the internet,

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.950 align:middle line:90%
it's a hoax, like Burrows Cave.

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:26.690 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And when he worked on it,
he called me two times.

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that's a really
difficult thing because what

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.520 align:middle line:90%
I find is just unbelievable.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And he did me a drawing on a
photograph of The Sun Pyramid.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And he showed me exactly,
in different colors,

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:52.410 align:middle line:84%
that there are-- there is a
tunnel system inside this so

00:32:52.410 --> 00:33:01.300 align:middle line:84%
called mountain going from five
meters down to 120, 140 meters.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And even he was drawing
some rooms inside.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.310 align:middle line:84%
So there are tunnels
with rooms that

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:10.121 align:middle line:84%
is spread down underneath
this Bosnian pyramid.

00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:10.820 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And he said there was,
indeed, a pyramid there.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.500 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a mountain.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.480 align:middle line:90%
There's pyramid there.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.941 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: And it shows exactly
that it's not just a mountain.

00:33:17.941 --> 00:33:18.640 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:23.770 align:middle line:84%
It must be a pyramid
because otherwise,

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:28.220 align:middle line:84%
why would you make some tunnels
and rooms inside a mountain?

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:33.591 align:middle line:84%
And it's also an approval
that it is a pyramid because--

00:33:33.591 --> 00:33:34.790 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
It's been approved.

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Professor Osmanagic did, in
the past, several excavations

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:40.790 align:middle line:90%
on top of the pyramid.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:45.420 align:middle line:10%
And they found human made
stone structures and all this.

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:46.140 align:middle line:10%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:51.200 align:middle line:10%
But officially, he is now--
the government prohibited it.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:84%
After the Egyptian specialists
said it's not a pyramid,

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.591 align:middle line:84%
they prohibited excavation
on the pyramids.

00:33:58.591 --> 00:33:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.010 align:middle line:84%
The Bosnian government--
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:03.811 align:middle line:84%
Prohibited any kind of
excavation on the pyramids--

00:34:03.811 --> 00:34:04.510 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:05.944 align:middle line:84%
Simply because of what
the Egyptians said?

00:34:05.944 --> 00:34:06.643 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:06.643 --> 00:34:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Of course, because
they are afraid

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:14.040 align:middle line:84%
that it's getting worldwide--
people are laughing about--

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.539 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Bosnia.
-Bosnia.

00:34:15.539 --> 00:34:17.429 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Because
of the ridicule factor.

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:22.900 align:middle line:84%
It's completely a ridicule
factor because if they--

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.690 align:middle line:90%
and these are pyramids.

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:29.270 align:middle line:84%
But if it's officially announced
that these pyramids must be

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:32.050 align:middle line:84%
older than at
least 10,000 years,

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:38.440 align:middle line:84%
then we talk about a high
civilization in Europe

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.610 align:middle line:90%
older than 10,000 years.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:45.550 align:middle line:84%
That means older than the famous
accepted high civilizations,

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.550 align:middle line:90%
which are only 6,000 years.

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:49.210 align:middle line:84%
So there would
be, automatically,

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:53.540 align:middle line:84%
a missing link of a high
civilization in Europe

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.969 align:middle line:90%
older than the Egyptian.

00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Because until now, the
official scientists,

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:03.460 align:middle line:84%
they say that the oldest
civilization, or the beginning

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:05.360 align:middle line:84%
of the high
civilization, in Egypt,

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:11.020 align:middle line:84%
in China, in Middle East,
they are only going-- they

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.860 align:middle line:90%
started about 6,000 years ago.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, some of that
has already fallen by.

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And the pyramids are
only 4,500 years old.

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:20.691 align:middle line:84%
And all this, it will-- it
would change everything.

00:35:20.691 --> 00:35:21.890 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
It upsets the story

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and creates missing
links, theoretically.

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:25.152 align:middle line:90%
Big missing links.

00:35:25.152 --> 00:35:26.085 align:middle line:90%
And it does upset academia.

00:35:26.085 --> 00:35:27.270 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't upset us though.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.970 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: No.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't our viewers.
KLAUS DONA: No.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.170 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting.
-We want more.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:30.960 align:middle line:90%
We want to know more.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.111 align:middle line:84%
Everything.
-Of course.

00:35:32.111 --> 00:35:32.810 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Because after getting-- after
being prohibited to make

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:42.330 align:middle line:84%
excavation on the pyramid, he
started-- because they found--

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:45.270 align:middle line:84%
with ground
penetrate radar, they

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:51.010 align:middle line:84%
found about 2.5 kilometers,
away from The Sun Pyramid,

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:54.120 align:middle line:84%
they found a huge
underground labyrinth.

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's just amazing.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:57.340 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
You went in there.

00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:00.240 align:middle line:84%
I went there because
they did excavation

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.640 align:middle line:90%
since the last few years.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.915 align:middle line:84%
And they still
continue because it

00:36:04.915 --> 00:36:09.164 align:middle line:84%
is such a huge, big,
underground labyrinth.

00:36:09.164 --> 00:36:10.130 align:middle line:90%
We hear they're doing, what?

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:11.010 align:middle line:90%
150?

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:13.600 align:middle line:84%
They're excavating
about 150 meters a year

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.830 align:middle line:84%
is the rate they're going.
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
-This is hand excavation.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
-And why?

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Because this labyrinth
is completely

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:25.550 align:middle line:90%
and precisely perfect filled.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.150 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean field?
Oh, field.

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:28.071 align:middle line:84%
The field.
Yes.

00:36:28.071 --> 00:36:29.470 align:middle line:84%
They filled it.
No, they filled.

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:30.169 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Oh.

00:36:30.169 --> 00:36:31.650 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing
has been filled in.

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:32.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.680 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is
perfectly filled.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And if I say perfectly, that
means that it's so perfect

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:43.430 align:middle line:84%
filled, that usually
you cannot do

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:46.150 align:middle line:84%
it by hand because
always you would

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:49.060 align:middle line:90%
have some empty space inside.

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:52.840 align:middle line:84%
There is not one,
little, empty space.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.607 align:middle line:84%
So they've used some
technology to back

00:36:54.607 --> 00:36:55.835 align:middle line:90%
fill the entire labyrinth.

00:36:55.835 --> 00:36:56.701 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: It looks like.

00:36:56.701 --> 00:36:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I wonder why that
would have been done.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.430 align:middle line:90%
That's a big question.

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:00.930 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Why
would that fill that in?

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Why do I make such a big
labyrinth, first of all?

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And Professor
Osmanagic will tell you

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.020 align:middle line:84%
that he thinks that
it was done already

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.150 align:middle line:90%
more than 10,000 years ago.

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:14.701 align:middle line:84%
That it was filled
in 10,000 or made?

00:37:14.701 --> 00:37:15.720 align:middle line:84%
It was built.
KLAUS DONA: No.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.070 align:middle line:84%
It was made at least.
-Yes.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:16.769 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:16.769 --> 00:37:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks, upon some
of the material findings,

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:25.100 align:middle line:84%
that it was closed
about 5,000 years ago.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:30.640 align:middle line:84%
But why, first of all, they
make such a big labyrinth

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.300 align:middle line:90%
with hundreds of tunnels?

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And the second,
most bigger question

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:39.120 align:middle line:84%
is, why do you fill
it so precisely?

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:42.151 align:middle line:84%
To fill it back so it almost
is completely inoperative then.

00:37:42.151 --> 00:37:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Completely.

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Because normally, if you
close your tunnel system

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.890 align:middle line:84%
or your secret place,
it's enough with about 5,

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:52.930 align:middle line:90%
or 10, or 15 meters.

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:54.771 align:middle line:84%
But the whole
thing-- it really--

00:37:54.771 --> 00:37:55.703 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: The whole thing.

00:37:55.703 --> 00:37:57.700 align:middle line:84%
It would seem that they
were trying to make whatever

00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.990 align:middle line:90%
it is completely inoperative.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.790 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:05.241 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, it is a
field inside and energetic.

00:38:05.241 --> 00:38:05.940 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: It is.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:10.271 align:middle line:84%
That is absolutely perfect
for rejuvenation, healing,

00:38:10.271 --> 00:38:10.970 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Which is interesting that
would all be shut down.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.490 align:middle line:84%
You have no radiation at all.
Nothing.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:17.310 align:middle line:90%
No radiation.

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:19.651 align:middle line:84%
Usually, there's radiation
just from the earth itself.

00:38:19.651 --> 00:38:21.220 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: Right.
-There's no radiation.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:22.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:24.487 align:middle line:90%
And you ions.

00:38:24.487 --> 00:38:25.220 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Ions.

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Negative ions.

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Over 40 times more than
in a very, very good room.

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:37.721 align:middle line:84%
And they further you go inside,
you have always fresh air.

00:38:37.721 --> 00:38:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
The further you go inside.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:40.880 align:middle line:90%
How does this happen?

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.010 align:middle line:90%
So that was filled in.

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:46.070 align:middle line:84%
So now they're excavating at
150 meters a year on that.

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:47.890 align:middle line:90%
But another phenomena.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Again, you mentioned
your German friend

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:53.870 align:middle line:84%
that has a very,
very, very interesting

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:57.020 align:middle line:84%
technology that's
able to determine

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.560 align:middle line:90%
what's going on in the earth.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned him a
bit ago, but you've also

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.140 align:middle line:84%
found, through this
technology, there are

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.430 align:middle line:84%
other payments in that area.
-Yes.

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:08.010 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: This
isn't the only pyramid.

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:08.710 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:10.610 align:middle line:90%
That's not the only one.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:14.330 align:middle line:84%
We got-- that's why
I, personally, think

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:17.690 align:middle line:90%
every mythology, every legend--

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Every legend.
OK.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Every legend has a big
percentage of reality included.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.500 align:middle line:84%
So now just to
get this straight,

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:33.280 align:middle line:84%
when you and your technological
partner get together,

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:37.050 align:middle line:84%
you often will follow
legend, where legend

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:38.587 align:middle line:90%
has it that there's been--

00:39:38.587 --> 00:39:39.520 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Or informations.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Or information about from maybe
even from the indigenous people

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.980 align:middle line:84%
that there was once a pyramid
here or different kinds

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.130 align:middle line:90%
of people and so forth.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Then that kind of determines
where you're going

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.847 align:middle line:90%
to focus your search, right?

00:39:52.847 --> 00:39:54.379 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: That's right.
-OK.

00:39:54.379 --> 00:39:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So in Bosnia now, you
have-- we have the known--

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.790 align:middle line:84%
The Sun Pyramid that they're--
well, they were excavating.

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:00.780 align:middle line:90%
And two more?

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.560 align:middle line:84%
You say you know of at least
two more pyramids in Bosnia?

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.550 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:05.297 align:middle line:90%
Next to this pyramid.

00:40:05.297 --> 00:40:06.630 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Right
next to this one.

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:07.594 align:middle line:84%
OK.
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:40:07.594 --> 00:40:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Where they are--
Professor Osmanagic

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:14.040 align:middle line:84%
is sure that these
are other pyramids.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.840 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: And you're--
the technology's showing

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:16.720 align:middle line:90%
they are other pyramids?

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.119 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: Yes.
-OK.

00:40:18.119 --> 00:40:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And now let's go to Crete.
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:24.990 align:middle line:84%
That's an interesting--
we were talking off camera.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Take a little time to share with
us what's been found in Crete.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.600 align:middle line:84%
In Crete, we found
also a pyramid

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:37.110 align:middle line:84%
because there existed an
information from old days

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:46.040 align:middle line:84%
that the second son of King
Midas was buried in a pyramid.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:46.740 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.805 align:middle line:84%
That was part of their
passed down history, religion.

00:40:48.805 --> 00:40:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And we found-- we got the
informations from local people

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:58.040 align:middle line:84%
that there is a mountain where,
the top of the mountain, there

00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.980 align:middle line:90%
are only a few trees.

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And the earth on
top of the mountain

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.950 align:middle line:84%
is different, like the
earths on the surrounding

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:09.090 align:middle line:90%
places and mountains.

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:14.170 align:middle line:84%
So we went there and we did
some research on the spot.

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And later on, through
my friends technology,

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:19.820 align:middle line:90%
and it's definitely a pyramid.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Again, like in Bosnia, there
are huge tunnels and rooms

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.570 align:middle line:90%
inside this so called mountain.

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:31.100 align:middle line:90%


00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And often the
legends of the people

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:39.251 align:middle line:84%
all over-- because you've done--
you've been to South America.

00:41:39.251 --> 00:41:39.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:41.990 align:middle line:84%
You've been all over the world
looking at this phenomena.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And your associate has also been
looking at it from their point

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:47.590 align:middle line:84%
of view, technological
point of view,

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:50.450 align:middle line:84%
to get validation and pinpoint
things here and there.

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, the
local population-- or I

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.210 align:middle line:84%
think you told me off
camera that in each case

00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:01.220 align:middle line:84%
the local population, native
population, has legend.

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:05.480 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Can you tell
what their legend generally is?

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:11.310 align:middle line:84%
It always says about long,
long history of humans there.

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Many of these legends,
in different continents,

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:18.440 align:middle line:84%
different countries, are
talking about a big flood.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:19.560 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: A big flood.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Only a few people survived.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Then the story about the giants.

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:27.150 align:middle line:90%
You find the story--

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:29.100 align:middle line:90%
The giants after the flood.

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.120 align:middle line:84%
You find the stories
and legends of giants.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:31.950 align:middle line:90%
Worldwide.

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:34.020 align:middle line:90%
In any country.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.860 align:middle line:90%
Any local tribe, everywhere.

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.220 align:middle line:90%
You find the story about giants.

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And they are also connected
with the pyramids.

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:46.410 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
Bolivia in Tiwanaku

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and in Mexico in Teotihuacan--
when the Spanish conquistadors

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:59.020 align:middle line:84%
arrived there, and they asked
the local people if they did

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:03.480 align:middle line:84%
these buildings, they
explained no, these

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:07.740 align:middle line:84%
were done at the time when
there was no sun shining

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:11.100 align:middle line:90%
and it was made by giants.

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing is that, again,

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:20.040 align:middle line:84%
pyramids and so-called flying
objects there-- I found

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.730 align:middle line:90%
out a very interesting story.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:26.050 align:middle line:84%
You have the explanations
in the Mahabharata

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:27.450 align:middle line:90%
in the Indian [INAUDIBLE]--

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:28.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:29.801 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: About the
so-called Vimanas.

00:43:29.801 --> 00:43:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Vimanas.
Yes.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And interesting story
is that the explanation

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:38.490 align:middle line:84%
of how did they fly was,
upon the translation,

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:40.015 align:middle line:90%
that they used mercury.

00:43:40.015 --> 00:43:42.600 align:middle line:90%


00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Didn't you know that?
-No.

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:44.530 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that.

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:47.250 align:middle line:84%
The translation says
that they used mercury.

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:48.230 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Mercury.

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And when I got friend
with the former of director

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:57.750 align:middle line:84%
of the archaeological area
of Teotihuacan in Mexico,

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:02.460 align:middle line:84%
he told me that he found
an underground tunnel.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.120 align:middle line:90%
And they did research in it.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:09.430 align:middle line:90%
And then he found a stone box.

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Perfectly made stone box.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And when he opened
it, he was shocked

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.830 align:middle line:84%
because this stone
box was filled

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:20.310 align:middle line:90%
completely with liquid mercury.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:21.460 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Mercury.

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.409 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: And he closed it.
-Yes.

00:44:23.409 --> 00:44:25.270 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: And he
informed the official--

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:26.700 align:middle line:90%
Hazmat team.

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Government.

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And the tunnel was
immediately closed.

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And later on,
American universities

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:36.290 align:middle line:90%
did some research inside.

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:38.870 align:middle line:90%
No, I have not heard that one.

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:39.890 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:40.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So we have native
population saying--

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and this again, we're
going to-- for the moment,

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:50.560 align:middle line:84%
in this conversation, we'll
place this near pyramids, where

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.800 align:middle line:84%
pyramids exist, which there
are many, many, many, many

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.320 align:middle line:90%
more than have been discovered.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I just came back yesterday
from a trip to South Africa.

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And I got from Michael
Tellinger the information

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:12.750 align:middle line:84%
that he thinks that
there are some three

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:15.210 align:middle line:90%
pyramids in a valley.

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And we went there,
the last few days,

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and we did some
research on the spot.

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And further research, now
with my friends technology,

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:27.870 align:middle line:84%
and I'm quite sure that even
there, we found three pyramids.

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:28.970 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
In the same area

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:30.607 align:middle line:90%
where these stone circles and--

00:45:30.607 --> 00:45:31.810 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: Adam's calendar.
Yes.

00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:32.470 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
And roughly Adam's

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:33.390 align:middle line:90%
calendar and all of that.

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:34.590 align:middle line:90%
The stone circles.

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:35.980 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:40.250 align:middle line:84%
So again, we're
looking at probably

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:42.480 align:middle line:84%
an advanced civilization
from elsewhere

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.810 align:middle line:84%
because certainly,
we haven't found

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:46.360 align:middle line:84%
any evidence that locals built
these incredible structures.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And now you're saying, in the
words of the locals themselves,

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.900 align:middle line:84%
the legend is, no,
we didn't build them.

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:53.841 align:middle line:84%
The giants built them.
Right?

00:45:53.841 --> 00:45:54.540 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And last time I
was here with you,

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:00.600 align:middle line:84%
I had the privilege
of holding in my hand

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.750 align:middle line:84%
the occipital bone
of a being, which

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:08.340 align:middle line:84%
appeared to be very human,
a humanoid or human being.

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:11.390 align:middle line:84%
That was judged to
be by the analyst

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:12.820 align:middle line:84%
at the universities
in Vienna-- right?

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:13.519 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Yes.

00:46:13.519 --> 00:46:14.860 align:middle line:84%
You had anatomy
labs look at it.

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:18.400 align:middle line:84%
The occipital bone of
someone maybe between 22, 23,

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.490 align:middle line:90%
24 feet tall.

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Right.
REGINA MEREDITH: Right in there.

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:21.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:23.510 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: And that--
you are in possession

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:24.380 align:middle line:90%
of that at this time?

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:25.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:29.310 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying-- from
what I'm understanding,

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:33.460 align:middle line:84%
the evidence is, there are these
giants all over the planet.

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:34.240 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.820 align:middle line:90%
You always find evidence.

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Even last year, I
got the information

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:46.750 align:middle line:84%
in Visoko-- the
Ambassador of Pakistan,

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:49.300 align:middle line:90%
he was there at our conference.

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And he explained also
about the giant skeleton

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:56.060 align:middle line:90%
findings in Pakistan.

00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:58.320 align:middle line:84%
So all over the world
you have stories

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:04.250 align:middle line:84%
and reports about over
sized humans from 22

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:09.620 align:middle line:90%
feet down to 10 feet, 15 feet.

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:11.200 align:middle line:90%
All different sizes.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.080 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA (VIDEO PLAYBACK):
That's an oversized skull

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.040 align:middle line:90%
from United States.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:19.400 align:middle line:90%


00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.710 align:middle line:90%
Another big skull.

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Very old photo, but it shows
that such artifacts were

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:28.210 align:middle line:90%
already in other centuries.

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:31.690 align:middle line:90%
This is a coal head.

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:37.900 align:middle line:84%
It is not sure yet if it
is a normal coal head or

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.760 align:middle line:90%
a real, petrified human skull.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:45.360 align:middle line:90%


00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:49.660 align:middle line:90%
Another long skull from IKA.

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And this IKA is
located very close

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:56.980 align:middle line:90%
to the famous Nazca Lines.

00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:00.290 align:middle line:84%
A so called cone
head, also from IKA.

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:03.050 align:middle line:90%


00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And this, in my opinion,
is the most strangest skull

00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:11.000 align:middle line:84%
because it is very
big, very long,

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.120 align:middle line:84%
and still has part of the
skin and hairs on top.

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So Klaus, what
this is showing us

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:23.060 align:middle line:84%
is that we have
completely misunderstood

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.980 align:middle line:90%
history around this planet.

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And that there
pyramids everywhere.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.610 align:middle line:84%
You're finding them
all over the place.

00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Far more than we'll probably
excavate-- than will ever be

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:34.970 align:middle line:90%
excavated within our lifetime.

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And so what does
this mean to you?

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:41.400 align:middle line:84%
They must have had a very
special function, which

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:44.010 align:middle line:90%
we cannot explain until today.

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:48.790 align:middle line:84%
But Professor Osmanagic
is doing a lot of research

00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:53.540 align:middle line:84%
at The Sun Pyramid in
Bosnia with scientists.

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And they found out
already several incredible

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:00.460 align:middle line:84%
informations, but you will
get this detailed information

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:01.160 align:middle line:90%
from him--

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.140 align:middle line:84%
We'll get these from
some of your-- OK.

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:03.840 align:middle line:90%
---personally.

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:09.693 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that the
majority of the pyramids

00:49:09.693 --> 00:49:12.080 align:middle line:90%
were tombs or graves.

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:12.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:13.670 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: No.

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Because even in the
big pyramid in Egypt,

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:21.086 align:middle line:84%
they didn't find any
mummy or any dead person.

00:49:21.086 --> 00:49:22.110 align:middle line:84%
No.
No.

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:24.790 align:middle line:90%
So they had other functions.

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Second one is,
for me, until now,

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:33.890 align:middle line:84%
there's no explanation why they
built these pyramids globally.

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Worldwide.
Everywhere.

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:39.410 align:middle line:90%
In the Pacific area on islands.

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Which gives us another hint to
the so called sunken continents

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:47.920 align:middle line:90%
Mu and Atlantis.

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:50.290 align:middle line:84%
But usually, you should
not talk about this

00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:51.800 align:middle line:90%
because they never existed.

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.420 align:middle line:90%
It's just a legend.

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And I also got, a few days
ago, a very interesting DVD

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:07.420 align:middle line:84%
about the finding of the
so called Atlantis looking

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:13.510 align:middle line:84%
construction, or earth
movement, exactly like Plato

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:16.050 align:middle line:90%
was explaining in his--

00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Plato.

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:18.230 align:middle line:84%
KLAUS DONA: Plato.
-Yes.

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:19.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.720 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: In Mauritania.

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.339 align:middle line:84%
Oh, in Mauritania.
OK.

00:50:23.339 --> 00:50:24.360 align:middle line:90%
I read about that.

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Erich von Daniken's recent book
talks about Plato's description

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:31.670 align:middle line:84%
of what Atlantis
was like that he

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:34.300 align:middle line:84%
was given from a
much more-- a much

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:35.690 align:middle line:90%
more elderly teacher himself.

00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying this
is found in Mauritania?

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.830 align:middle line:90%
Mauritania and inside the land.

00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:50.001 align:middle line:84%
But those researchers explained
that there was sea in old days.

00:50:50.001 --> 00:50:50.700 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And the structure itself, even
on Google Earth you can see it,

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:59.120 align:middle line:84%
it looks like the
explanation of Plato.

00:50:59.120 --> 00:50:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:06.130 align:middle line:84%
So with my friend, we tried
to do research on this area.

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:08.590 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we are on the right way.

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like
the evidence-- there

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:11.950 align:middle line:84%
is some evidence
there may be truth

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:13.940 align:middle line:90%
in this particular region.

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:14.660 align:middle line:90%
KLAUS DONA: Could be.

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:16.170 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Klaus, I just-- I
love talking with you.

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I know that you have
many, many more things

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:23.280 align:middle line:84%
you can't even talk about
just yet because they're

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.100 align:middle line:90%
still works in progress.

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:28.100 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Which means
I probably will have to come

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:30.180 align:middle line:90%
to Vienna again next year.

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.579 align:middle line:84%
I hope so.
I hope so.

00:51:31.579 --> 00:51:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So that we can catch
up on what's going to be

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:34.370 align:middle line:90%
known between now and then.
