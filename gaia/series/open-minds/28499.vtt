>>REGINA MEREDITH: Get
a pen and some paper out

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.436 align:middle line:10%
because you're
going to learn more

00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:22.860 align:middle line:10%
about your body's
ecosystem in one hour

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.630 align:middle line:10%
than you ever thought possible.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.320 align:middle line:10%
Compton Rom is a microbiologist
who extended his knowledge far

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.570 align:middle line:10%
beyond his master's degree into
the worlds of interconnected

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.410 align:middle line:10%
information systems,
which brings

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.720 align:middle line:10%
a new light to the
world of microbes.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Compton says that our bodies
cannot sustain good health

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.060 align:middle line:84%
without good microbes, and that
we must learn to respect them.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Toward that end, he
founded a company

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.090 align:middle line:84%
that uses microbes and
frequencies to recover

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.590 align:middle line:90%
our health.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say,
his work is absolutely

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.790 align:middle line:90%
mind-altering in my book.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.500 align:middle line:84%
I think this is one of the most
fascinating subjects of all.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.740 align:middle line:84%
But before we even get
going on the microbes,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.370 align:middle line:84%
let's talk a little bit
about your own background,

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:84%
and it was a convoluted path
arriving where you are now.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And just tell us a
little bit about that.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>COMPTON ROM: Well, I
actually got my start

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.510 align:middle line:84%
by going to medical school at
the University of Michigan.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:10%
And I finished up my schooling
by getting a Master's Degree

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.530 align:middle line:10%
in Microbiology at Michigan
State University, where

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.050 align:middle line:10%
I worked under the auspices
of the Microbial Ecology

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:10%
Center, which looked at
the beneficial microbes

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.020 align:middle line:10%
and how did they degrade toxins
in the external environment.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.110 align:middle line:10%
But how also microbes
were really important

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.530 align:middle line:10%
in agriculture.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So from there, I
thought I was going

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:84%
to get a career
in biotechnology,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:84%
but I fell into the
laps of IBM and I

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.100 align:middle line:84%
started working for the
pharmaceutical companies

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.530 align:middle line:84%
looking over gobs of data and
analyzing data, and seeing

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.510 align:middle line:84%
where things worked
and where things didn't

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.444 align:middle line:84%
work based on the
research out there.

00:01:55.444 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I took a path
thinking, oh, you know,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.859 align:middle line:84%
the internet was
really good for me,

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:04.530 align:middle line:84%
so I started working with IBM
again and being farmed out

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.690 align:middle line:84%
for search engine companies
like Google and Yahoo,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.940 align:middle line:84%
and a little company
called Inktomi.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And that was when I
started getting access

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.340 align:middle line:84%
to all these university archives
and university research.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And I really started
looking into the research

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.950 align:middle line:84%
of alternative science and
how they became validated

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.010 align:middle line:90%
through the scientific research.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And as we know, a lot of these
scientific research papers

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.970 align:middle line:84%
have been buried and not really
being shown to the public.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.750 align:middle line:90%
But I had full access to them.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that natural herbs
can actually-- back then,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.460 align:middle line:90%
they were curing AIDS.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And I knew microbes were
actually killing viruses,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.930 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't need
vaccines to kill the viruses.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.940 align:middle line:90%
You can actually use microbes.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And so from that
research, that's

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.430 align:middle line:84%
how I started a little company
called Ascended Health.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.890 align:middle line:84%
The Native Americans, they
actually traded in this earth.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle line:90%
They actually have edible clays.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Every tribe, every medicine
man has his own set

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.910 align:middle line:84%
of herbs that he likes
to use, but they also

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.720 align:middle line:90%
have edible clays.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And you actually saw this
during the hurricane in Haiti,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.060 align:middle line:84%
when all the people on
CNN were eating mud pies.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.702 align:middle line:84%
They were actually eating
clay to sustain them.

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now see, we
watched that and thought,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:84%
oh, these poor people
are having to eat dirt.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.360 align:middle line:84%
We didn't understand
that there were some--

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: They were
getting minerals.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -components
of nutrition there.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:31.806 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:03:31.806 --> 00:03:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: You go down to
the Peru, to the Amazon,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.160 align:middle line:84%
and you look at
the birds in Manu

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:84%
eating the clay off
the side of the rivers.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's a big
tourist attraction.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:84%
But they don't really tell
them that the reason why

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.410 align:middle line:84%
the birds are eating the clay
is because the clay is filled

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:84%
with bentonite and
it coats their system

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.460 align:middle line:84%
so they can eat the
poisonous seeds in the Amazon

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.364 align:middle line:84%
that the other
animals can't eat,

00:03:55.364 --> 00:03:56.530 align:middle line:90%
and they don't get poisoned.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, see, this is
what I love about your work.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.453 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter where
we go in the conversation,

00:04:00.453 --> 00:04:02.960 align:middle line:84%
we get all these
incredible side notes.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And so now on a
large theme, let's

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.750 align:middle line:84%
go to the world of
microbes and give us

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.710 align:middle line:84%
an introduction in
terms of how long

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.680 align:middle line:84%
they've been here as opposed
to as how they survive,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.760 align:middle line:84%
how the world really will
be their way or the highway.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, let's go
over the latest science.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.060 align:middle line:84%
I always like to start
everything else out

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.070 align:middle line:84%
in basic fundamental science,
and then go to the esoteric.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:84%
So all the work
that we do is based

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.200 align:middle line:90%
on solid scientific research.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.220 align:middle line:84%
If it's not researched, if it's
not validated by scientists

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
and basically printed
in a scientific journal,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.160 align:middle line:84%
then I don't usually
pursue that line of work.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Well lately, since 2003, there's
all this new science coming out

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.010 align:middle line:84%
that microbes are very
beneficial to human life.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's now called
the Microbiome Project.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And it started out through
the Genome Project,

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.850 align:middle line:84%
when they were starting
to study and sequence

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.480 align:middle line:90%
the DNA of the human being.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And they finally sequenced
the DNA of the human being.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.380 align:middle line:90%
And they go, wow, we did it.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.620 align:middle line:84%
We sequenced the DNA
in a human being,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.840 align:middle line:84%
let's see how many genes are in
humans, because humans are so

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:84%
evolved they must
have more genes

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.360 align:middle line:90%
than any animal in the world.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that the
little Arabidopsis plant, which

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.440 align:middle line:84%
is a little tiny plant
that grows in the cold,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:90%
has about 128,000 genes.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And the humans only
had as many genes

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:84%
as the little lowly
fly, the Drosophila fly,

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.600 align:middle line:90%
probably like 30,000 genes.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.520 align:middle line:84%
So the scientists
were wondering,

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.860 align:middle line:84%
how could a complex organism
like the human being

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:84%
exist versus a little
organism like the fly

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.430 align:middle line:84%
exist together and be
so different; but yet,

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:84%
the amount of genes that
they have is the same.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.935 align:middle line:84%
And these scientists
are saying, well,

00:05:59.935 --> 00:06:01.310 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be
something else.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's study the
microbes in the body.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And they thought that it was
going to be a little project,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.130 align:middle line:84%
but they found something
really fascinating.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.460 align:middle line:84%
They found that out of all the
living cells in this ecosystem

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle line:84%
we call the human
body, they found

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.060 align:middle line:84%
that there was over 100
trillion living cells

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:84%
in this ecosystem we
call the human body.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.510 align:middle line:84%
But when you count all the
human cells, all the skin cells,

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:84%
the eye cells, the cardiac
cells, the hair cells,

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.172 align:middle line:84%
there's only 10
trillion of those cells.

00:06:31.172 --> 00:06:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do the
math on that then.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Do the math.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.290 align:middle line:84%
So only 10 trillion out
of 100 trillion cells

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.430 align:middle line:90%
were human cells.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.750 align:middle line:84%
That meant 90% of the living
cells in this ecosystem

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.400 align:middle line:84%
in the human body
weren't even human.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.110 align:middle line:84%
They were actually
microbial cells.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.690 align:middle line:90%
They're made of mostly bacteria.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:84%
But we have viruses,
we have parasites,

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.700 align:middle line:84%
we have fungi in our
bodies, and they all

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.570 align:middle line:90%
call this body our home.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.800 align:middle line:84%
So I started reading
all this material.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.960 align:middle line:84%
I found that actually
fascinating that only 10%

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:90%
of the human body is human.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.140 align:middle line:84%
But then when the
scientists were going,

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.250 align:middle line:90%
well, let's study the DNA.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I bet 98% of the DNA in
the human body is human.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, guess the percentage
of the DNA is human.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.760 align:middle line:90%
2%.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 2.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: 2.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.010 align:middle line:90%
So do the math.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.160 align:middle line:90%
2% to 10%.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:84%
We're only 2%
human or 10% human.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.930 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of the
matter is, the result

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.330 align:middle line:84%
is the majority of our body
doesn't come from our genes.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.874 align:middle line:90%
It comes from our environment.

00:07:26.874 --> 00:07:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And that comes from the microbes
that we have in our body.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they've
been around for--

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Millions--

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let's talk
about the very beginning.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.379 align:middle line:90%
The beginning.

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So at the very
beginning, this Earth

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.835 align:middle line:90%
is 4.5 billion years old.

00:07:37.835 --> 00:07:40.180 align:middle line:84%
It took the Earth
a billion years

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.790 align:middle line:84%
to cool down enough
for the first organisms

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.250 align:middle line:90%
to live in the Earth.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.190 align:middle line:84%
So the first organisms
on this Earth

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.960 align:middle line:84%
were unicellular organisms,
and they were basically

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:90%
the bacteria.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And science has found out
now that space dust coming

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.210 align:middle line:84%
from space are all
particles of bacteria.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And when they landed
on this Earth,

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.680 align:middle line:84%
they were the first organisms
to actually colonize

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.240 align:middle line:90%
this Earth, the bacteria.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And the bacteria actually had
little bacteria on top of them,

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and those little bacteria
actually had viruses.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.610 align:middle line:84%
So the bacteria actually have
viruses infecting the bacteria.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And there was no fungi,
there's no parasites,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.480 align:middle line:84%
it was just bacteria and viruses
that were living on this Earth.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And four 3 billion
years-- the Earth

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.510 align:middle line:90%
is 4.5 billion years old, OK.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:29.830 align:middle line:84%
From 1 billion years
to 3.5 billion years,

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.476 align:middle line:84%
only the bacteria
lived on this Earth.

00:08:32.476 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And the only things-- they
only thought two things.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Can I eat you?

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Can you eat me?

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.049 align:middle line:84%
And they looked at this
Earth-- they basically

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:43.590 align:middle line:84%
looked at every place on this
Earth, they either lived in it

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.140 align:middle line:90%
or they broke it down to eat it.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.640 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
thing that they did.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.110 align:middle line:84%
They said, oh, there's
not a bacteria that's

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.870 align:middle line:84%
living in this particular
strata of Earth,

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.810 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'm going to
set up camp there.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:54.972 align:middle line:90%
I can live on rocks.

00:08:54.972 --> 00:08:55.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.700 align:middle line:90%
I can live in water.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.450 align:middle line:90%
Or guess what?

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.070 align:middle line:90%
I can live somewhere else.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.780 align:middle line:90%
I can live in the heat.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.762 align:middle line:84%
You actually find bacteria in
the most extreme temperatures

00:09:04.762 --> 00:09:06.720 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth because they
can live in anything.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.930 align:middle line:90%
They could break down anything.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:84%
We find bacteria breaking down
the nuclear waste of Chernobyl.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
When you actually
walked in Chernobyl,

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.784 align:middle line:84%
there's black slime inside
the nuclear reactor.

00:09:18.784 --> 00:09:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
doing their job.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.282 align:middle line:84%
They're actually neutralizing,
or consuming, radiation.

00:09:23.282 --> 00:09:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: They're
consuming radiation.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nuclear waste.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Yeah, they
can consume anything.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And in the 1970s, there
was this huge accident

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.200 align:middle line:84%
that happened in the
Love Canal in New York.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:36.910 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I remember that, yes.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.935 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: It was actually the birth
of the environmental movement.

00:09:39.935 --> 00:09:41.970 align:middle line:84%
You know the Indian
with the tearing eye?

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:84%
That was because
of the Love Canal.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And the Love Canal was because
a chemical company, unnamed, had

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:84%
buried transistors
and-- big transistors,

00:09:53.590 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:84%
the kind that had dioxin
and PBBs and PCBs up

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.267 align:middle line:90%
on the telephone poles.

00:10:02.267 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:90%
And they just buried them.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And it slowly leaked
out into the ground.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And it leaked out so
much that the frogs

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:90%
started growing three heads.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, no big
deal, until babies started

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.090 align:middle line:84%
to have malformations and
congenital deformities.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.326 align:middle line:84%
And so the government
said, wow, we

00:10:17.326 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:84%
need to start doing
something like this

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.760 align:middle line:84%
because this is all
over the United States.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first
Superfund site that happened.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And so the government of New
York and the United States

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.970 align:middle line:84%
government actually put
the biggest punitive damage

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:84%
awards towards the state of
New York against this chemical

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.430 align:middle line:84%
company, and it was like
$10 billion or something

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.350 align:middle line:90%
like that to clean the site up.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And because of all the lawyers
and the legal wranglings,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.930 align:middle line:84%
it actually took 10 years to get
this to come out into the open.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:55.640 align:middle line:84%
So during that time, scientists
kept monitoring the Love Canal.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And over a five year span,
this young scientist came in

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and he started measuring
the PCB levels, which

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.270 align:middle line:90%
had a 50,000 year half life.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.280 align:middle line:84%
The scientist's
like, there's no way

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.430 align:middle line:84%
that this thing is
going to get broken

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.080 align:middle line:90%
down enough in our lifetime.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And these scientists from
the chemical company--

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:84%
they sent scientists in,
they said five years later,

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.240 align:middle line:84%
why don't you just measure the
PBB levels and the PCB levels

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.290 align:middle line:90%
there another time.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.414 align:middle line:84%
And the scientist's like,
it's just a waste of my time.

00:11:25.414 --> 00:11:26.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if anything
there's going

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.230 align:middle line:84%
to be more because
of all the leakage.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.260 align:middle line:84%
But they went in there, there
was a significant decrease--

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.880 align:middle line:84%
there was like a 25%
decrease in PBBs and PCBs.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And the scientist is
like, wait a minute.

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:41.884 align:middle line:90%
Something's breaking this down.

00:11:41.884 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's not dissipating.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not breaking
down by itself.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Something is actively
breaking this down.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was
they looked at the muck

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.450 align:middle line:90%
in the bottom of the river.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:84%
They found out that microbes
were breaking down the PBBs.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:04.320 align:middle line:84%
It is now a science called
Bacterial and Bioremediation.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So every time there's an
oil spill that happens,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.060 align:middle line:84%
we don't clean it up any
more like the Exxon Valdez.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.570 align:middle line:84%
We just throw microbes at it
because they will eat the oil.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately for us, when the
Gulf blew up with the oil spill

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.150 align:middle line:84%
there, there were natural
microbes already eating that.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or
not, the dispersants

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.220 align:middle line:84%
that they threw
in there actually

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.790 align:middle line:84%
helped the microbes eat
the oil better and faster,

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.320 align:middle line:90%
because it actually disperses--

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Because there was a
lot of controversy

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:34.730 align:middle line:90%
around those dispersants.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:34.802 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:12:34.802 --> 00:12:37.010 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of controversy
around the dispersants

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:84%
because it got into
the bloodstream.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.950 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
silver lining to that,

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and the microbes actually
broke them down even more.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And another thing was that
the PBBs and the PCBs,

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:84%
they were actually broken
down not just by one microbe,

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:84%
it was actually broken down
by a community of microbes.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.600 align:middle line:84%
In nature, nature
works by community.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Nature doesn't work by
just one person, right?

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:07.760 align:middle line:84%
To me having one
company form a monopoly

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and kind of like towering
over their competition,

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.317 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't work in nature.

00:13:13.317 --> 00:13:15.900 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a whole bunch
of companies working in concert

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.110 align:middle line:84%
together to create
a real economy.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So with this economy and this
system, it worked like this.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:27.320 align:middle line:84%
It worked like there was one
microbe that saw the PBBs.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a very
big microbe, and it

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.970 align:middle line:84%
wasn't the most
populated microbe.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.180 align:middle line:84%
It was this one
little tiny microbe

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:39.130 align:middle line:84%
that basically made its
living one microbe at a time

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.810 align:middle line:84%
versus all the 10,000,
10 million microbes

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:90%
that are out there.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.730 align:middle line:90%
But it ate PBBs and PCBs.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And it ate it where it
only ate one bond of it.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And its excrement
was PBB plus one,

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:84%
because it only
ate one electron.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So its excrement was
actually out there,

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and then another microbe
goes, wow, PBB plus one.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.189 align:middle line:90%
I think I can eat that.

00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:04.605 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
ate the excrement.

00:14:04.605 --> 00:14:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: It ate the
excrement and its excrement

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.404 align:middle line:84%
became food for
the next microbe.

00:14:09.404 --> 00:14:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: It became a
whole chain of microbes

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.160 align:middle line:84%
that started to eat
this in concert.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually eating
the excrement of each other.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.345 align:middle line:84%
It happens in
nature all the time.

00:14:21.345 --> 00:14:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's what's
happening in our bodies.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.345 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: That's what's
happening in our bodies.

00:14:25.345 --> 00:14:29.286 align:middle line:84%
When we eat food in our
bodies, the first person

00:14:29.286 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:84%
that eats the food are
actually the microbes.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.285 align:middle line:90%
It isn't us.

00:14:32.285 --> 00:14:33.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the microbes
that actually eat it.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:37.021 align:middle line:84%
We cannot eat food and digest
food unless the microbes digest

00:14:37.021 --> 00:14:37.520 align:middle line:90%
it first.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:90%
They get first dibs.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.561 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so they're
going through this break

00:14:40.561 --> 00:14:43.290 align:middle line:84%
down, this excreting,
and then other microbes

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.590 align:middle line:90%
are consuming that.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.730 align:middle line:84%
I assume there are chemical
reactions within that?

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:48.849 align:middle line:90%
There are chemical reactions.

00:14:48.849 --> 00:14:50.390 align:middle line:84%
There are things
that are being made.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.315 align:middle line:84%
There are antioxidants
that are being made.

00:14:52.315 --> 00:14:53.940 align:middle line:84%
There are vitamins
that are being made.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.540 align:middle line:84%
The only reason why we
have 20 essential vitamins

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.170 align:middle line:84%
is because there isn't
bacteria to create those 20

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.670 align:middle line:90%
essential vitamins.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.390 align:middle line:84%
If we didn't have
bacteria in our bodies,

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.600 align:middle line:84%
we'd have 10,000
essential vitamins

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.860 align:middle line:84%
that we would need
in our bodies.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.084 align:middle line:84%
The other 10,000 are
made by all the microbes.

00:15:09.084 --> 00:15:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
what happens when

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.810 align:middle line:84%
we start looking at the
whole cleanliness issue?

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, keep the
baby off the floor.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Don't let the baby crawl
around on a dirty floor,

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.930 align:middle line:90%
put things in its mouth.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And we have fruit
and vegetable wash

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:84%
to make sure anything
that's on our vegetables--

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.880 align:middle line:84%
even the organic ones--
they're nice and clean.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.660 align:middle line:84%
What about the notion of
this kind of cleanliness?

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: You're talking
about hygiene.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.392 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, hygiene
is very important.

00:15:33.392 --> 00:15:36.280 align:middle line:84%
We need to keep the
bad microbes off of us,

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.460 align:middle line:84%
but we also have to
keep in mind that we

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.950 align:middle line:84%
can't go so far that we
actually kill the good microbes.

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And in order to understand
that, let's go back

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.180 align:middle line:84%
to the beginning
of our conversation

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.290 align:middle line:84%
when the Earth was
a billion years old

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and the first microbes
started to colonize the Earth.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And the microbes lived on
this Earth for over 2 and 1/2

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:59.960 align:middle line:84%
billion years before the first
multicellular organism, called

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.250 align:middle line:90%
the algae, colonized the Earth.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So this higher life form
went into the Earth--

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.830 align:middle line:84%
and the microbes have been
here for over 2 billion years.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying, I can
eat you, you can eat me,

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.750 align:middle line:90%
we can break everything down.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And the first higher organism,
the algae, came in there

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.550 align:middle line:90%
and said, hey, you know what?

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm more evolved that you guys.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to come in and I'm
just going to set up shop.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And the microbes are
looking at him like--

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like us being in sixth
grade going into a new school,

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and just because we're older
than all the other kids,

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.934 align:middle line:84%
we're going to take
over that school.

00:16:32.934 --> 00:16:35.350 align:middle line:84%
But all the other kids, the
fifth graders and the existing

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:84%
sixth graders go, we know
who the good teachers are,

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.510 align:middle line:84%
we know who the
bad teachers are.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They know
the lay of the land.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: They know
the lay of the land.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.270 align:middle line:84%
We know where you're
going to get beat up.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:47.266 align:middle line:84%
And basically, new kid,
if you don't serve us,

00:16:47.266 --> 00:16:48.390 align:middle line:90%
we're going to beat you up.

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So what are you
going to do for us?

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the microbes
did to the lowly algae.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And they basically
said, algae, you either

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.720 align:middle line:84%
serve us or we're
going to eat you.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.030 align:middle line:90%
What's it going to be?

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And the algae goes,
you know what?

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to hang out and we're
going to form groups of algae

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:05.960 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
formed the first life

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.369 align:middle line:90%
form called the Hydra.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:12.069 align:middle line:84%
And the Hydra was a
cylindrical object

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:15.400 align:middle line:84%
that basically had a
funnel to funnel in water,

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.420 align:middle line:84%
and it had motile feet
that actually moved around.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were the first
kind of like living plants,

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.560 align:middle line:84%
but they were actually
collections of multicellular

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.020 align:middle line:84%
organisms that
actually moved around.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.650 align:middle line:90%
But microbes lived in them.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were the things that
algae said, hey microbes.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you come in here
and we'll protect you.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.940 align:middle line:84%
We'll be your
vessel so you don't

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
have to defend
yourself all the time.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.210 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:42.610 align:middle line:84%
We're going to collect
food for you too.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:44.360 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
this little canal

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.520 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to put
food inside this tube,

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.930 align:middle line:90%
and you guys can eat it first.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll have your scraps,
we'll have your excrement.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And we'll also
move you from place

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:56.910 align:middle line:84%
to place so you don't have to
expend all your energy moving.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the microbes
became the mafia of this Earth.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And they said, OK, you're
going to work for us now.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.670 align:middle line:90%
Fast forward to human beings.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:90%
We're just a large hydra.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.290 align:middle line:84%
We feed the microbes, we
give them a place to eat,

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:13.759 align:middle line:84%
and we give them
the food to eat.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:16.050 align:middle line:84%
We give them a body to stay
in, then they're protected,

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:17.070 align:middle line:90%
and we move around.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:18.610 align:middle line:90%
We do all the work for them.

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.220 align:middle line:84%
They basically play us
like little Wii machines,

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.300 align:middle line:90%
and they tell us what to eat.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is all
scientifically proven.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:26.915 align:middle line:84%
You change the
microbes in your body,

00:18:26.915 --> 00:18:28.680 align:middle line:84%
you actually change the
cravings in your body.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.054 align:middle line:84%
The microbes tell
us what to eat,

00:18:30.054 --> 00:18:33.190 align:middle line:84%
they tell us what to think,
they give us our emotions.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:34.817 align:middle line:90%
And they also protect us.

00:18:34.817 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is
huge, because now we're

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.820 align:middle line:84%
looking at a time
when we've been

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.590 align:middle line:90%
genetically engineering food.

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:43.360 align:middle line:84%
When we've been certainly adding
a huge toxin load to the food

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.170 align:middle line:90%
supplies.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:90%
We have a lot of stress.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.300 align:middle line:84%
It seems like we're doing a lot
of things that would tick off

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.700 align:middle line:90%
our microbial community.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And with the age of antibiotics
that started over 80 years ago,

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.270 align:middle line:84%
it's just been killing
off the natural microbes

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.340 align:middle line:90%
that call this body our home.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.279 align:middle line:84%
Like imagine if
your neighborhood--

00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:05.320 align:middle line:84%
you know all the neighbors
in your neighborhood--

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.570 align:middle line:84%
imagine if you kick them
all out of their houses,

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:84%
and then the squatters
would move in.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.544 align:middle line:84%
Like these people just
roaming the streets

00:19:11.544 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and they don't know
anything about your house.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, your
house starts falling apart

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.116 align:middle line:84%
because they don't know
where the hammers are.

00:19:17.116 --> 00:19:19.420 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a mortgage
on the house, so--

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are
the antibiotics?

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: No.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:24.310 align:middle line:84%
These are the bad
microbes that move in

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:28.355 align:middle line:84%
because the antibiotics were
basically the policemen that

00:19:28.355 --> 00:19:30.730 align:middle line:84%
kicked everybody out of the
house, that killed everybody.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:31.045 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:19:31.045 --> 00:19:31.920 align:middle line:90%
That killed the good microbes.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.628 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: That killed
all the good microbes.

00:19:33.628 --> 00:19:38.140 align:middle line:84%
The microbes, they consider
this body their house.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the point of
view from their point of view,

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.470 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that we're
not the only inhabitants

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.310 align:middle line:84%
of this ecosystem
called the human body.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:49.830 align:middle line:90%
In fact, we're the minority.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:53.360 align:middle line:84%
We have been living in our own
personal apartheid for hundreds

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.360 align:middle line:84%
of years, and we
don't even know it.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.200 align:middle line:84%
When South Africa finally
said, hey, guess what?

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.904 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the
population matters.

00:19:59.904 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we should include
them in our government

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.800 align:middle line:84%
and maybe we should include them
and have a say in a government.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.870 align:middle line:84%
10 years later, they're
a thriving economy.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I see
this in you, and also

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.390 align:middle line:90%
your beautiful partner, Janet.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And this whole
notion of respecting

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.940 align:middle line:84%
what's in your
body as this colony

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.350 align:middle line:84%
that you're simply housing
is a whole different way

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.010 align:middle line:84%
to look at the healing
process as well.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And maybe briefly--
we're going to take

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.260 align:middle line:84%
a break in a few
minutes here-- but I

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.990 align:middle line:84%
think there's enough time for
you to talk about how healing

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:84%
actually begins
when we're looking

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.460 align:middle line:90%
at ourselves as a colony.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.580 align:middle line:84%
So you find out you maybe
have food poisoning.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.080 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty
violent, pretty quick.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.080 align:middle line:90%
You throw up, it's done.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.430 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at more chronic
kinds of conditions, or even

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:46.280 align:middle line:90%
the common cold.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.350 align:middle line:84%
How do you start
working with this colony

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.490 align:middle line:84%
without the introduction
of artificial things

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.870 align:middle line:84%
that can actually be harmful
to the friendly microbes

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:56.050 align:middle line:90%
and bacteria?

00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So let's start with
the common cold, for example.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:03.380 align:middle line:84%
The human body is
known to have at least

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.720 align:middle line:90%
three different immune systems.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:10.125 align:middle line:84%
The immune system that we call
our humoral immune system,

00:21:10.125 --> 00:21:13.280 align:middle line:84%
our antibodies, is actually our
double reserve immune system.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.160 align:middle line:84%
It's only supposed
to be tapped into

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.915 align:middle line:84%
once our secondary
immune system, called

00:21:17.915 --> 00:21:19.480 align:middle line:84%
our cellular immune
system, which

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.450 align:middle line:84%
is mediated by human
cells called the T cells,

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:23.560 align:middle line:90%
are kind of tapped out.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.450 align:middle line:90%
Then the antibodies come in.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.110 align:middle line:84%
That's our double reserve
immune system, our T cells,

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:29.860 align:middle line:84%
which is our cellular
immune system,

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.290 align:middle line:90%
our secondary immune system.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is not
scientific fact.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.270 align:middle line:84%
This is my interpretation
of the immune system.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:42.120 align:middle line:84%
But scientific fact is that
70% to 80% of our immune system

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.910 align:middle line:84%
is this kind of like
undefined immune system called

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.490 align:middle line:90%
our "innate immunity."

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.920 align:middle line:84%
But science is finding out
that this innate immunity

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.254 align:middle line:90%
are actually the microbes.

00:21:51.254 --> 00:21:52.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why when we
were going to school,

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:56.707 align:middle line:84%
some kids got sick all the
time, some kids never got sick.

00:21:56.707 --> 00:21:58.540 align:middle line:84%
I was one of those kids
that never got sick.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.498 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could eat dirt,
I could eat anything.

00:22:00.498 --> 00:22:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was
one of those, too.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: And that's because
the microbes in our bodies

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.630 align:middle line:84%
were so diverse, and there were
so many microbes in our body

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:11.360 align:middle line:84%
that called this their home,
they were defending their turf.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:84%
If your child is so
hygienic that he doesn't

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.570 align:middle line:84%
have the microbes, they don't
have the natural defenders

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:90%
in our body.

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then if you add
to that all these processed

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.470 align:middle line:84%
foods, which means
you're definitely

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.891 align:middle line:84%
not getting the load
of healthy ones.

00:22:24.891 --> 00:22:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: When you're
eating processed foods,

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.440 align:middle line:84%
again teleologically,
the microbes

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.970 align:middle line:84%
are hundreds and thousands of
years old because they just

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:35.180 align:middle line:84%
replicate and
replicate over time.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And when they're
eating a sandwich,

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.890 align:middle line:84%
they're expecting real meat,
which they're not getting;

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:43.470 align:middle line:84%
they're expecting real wheat,
which they're not getting,

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and they're expecting
real butter, which

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.190 align:middle line:90%
they're not getting.

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.930 align:middle line:84%
They get this stuff called
artificial mayonnaise.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking at
this food like, I've never

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.580 align:middle line:90%
seen this stuff before.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.090 align:middle line:90%
So they--

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
can't break it down.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:56.770 align:middle line:84%
They can't go through
the normal processes.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: They can't break it down.

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:58.700 align:middle line:90%
They kind of die off.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:22:59.899 align:middle line:90%
They actually get toxified.

00:22:59.899 --> 00:23:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then we're toxic.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.104 align:middle line:90%
When they're dead--

00:23:02.104 --> 00:23:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: They're toxic--

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -we're toxic.

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: -and we're toxic.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
eating food, you're

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:90%
never eating sterile food.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.056 align:middle line:84%
You're actually eating food
with millions of microbes.

00:23:10.056 --> 00:23:10.680 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Those microbes are actually
feeding on this mutant food.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:14.760 align:middle line:90%
So guess what?

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.080 align:middle line:90%
You get mutant microbes.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So your body gets microbes
that exist in your cell that

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:23.390 align:middle line:84%
have been growing
on saccharin, that's

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:25.730 align:middle line:84%
been growing on high
fructose corn syrup,

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:27.730 align:middle line:84%
and they've never
seen this body before.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:29.646 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to get into all of that.

00:23:29.646 --> 00:23:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, in private
conversation before we started

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.770 align:middle line:84%
rolling, you're also saying
that they determine when we're

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.660 align:middle line:84%
going to die and what
we're going to die of.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the microbes
run the show.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:41.957 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk more about that,
high fructose corn syrup,

00:23:41.957 --> 00:23:43.165 align:middle line:90%
and much more when we return.

00:23:43.165 --> 00:23:52.030 align:middle line:90%


00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.111 align:middle line:84%
Well, flu season is
just about upon us.

00:23:54.111 --> 00:23:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And now they're trying
to funnel everybody

00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.040 align:middle line:84%
down to your local drugstore
to get your vaccines.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.500 align:middle line:84%
But in reality,
there's another way

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:05.100 align:middle line:84%
to deal with flu that's much
more native to our bodies

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.500 align:middle line:84%
and much less damaging
in terms of side effects.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.840 align:middle line:84%
So, okay, you're starting
to feel the chills,

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.930 align:middle line:84%
your mind's going fuzzy
on you, and your nose

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:13.780 align:middle line:90%
is starting to run.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.845 align:middle line:90%
You've got the flu.

00:24:15.845 --> 00:24:18.096 align:middle line:84%
Now how do you start doing
this from this perspective?

00:24:18.096 --> 00:24:19.678 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: From the
microbial perspective?

00:24:19.678 --> 00:24:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:24.690 align:middle line:10%
>>ROM: First is to get an
education as to what the flu is

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:29.370 align:middle line:10%
and how we get it, and how
our body combats the flu.

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:10%
And vaccines, despite
popular opinion,

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.130 align:middle line:10%
isn't the only way our bodies
actually fight off viruses.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.200 align:middle line:10%
Actually, our bodies
naturally fight off viruses

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.650 align:middle line:10%
just by themselves.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And the way our body
fights off the virus

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.240 align:middle line:90%
is actually a really good thing.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Having fever, as long as it's
not too high, is a good thing.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Having a runny nose, as long
as it's not driving you crazy,

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.530 align:middle line:84%
is actually a good thing
because you're actually

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.660 align:middle line:84%
expelling toxins
out of your body.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.305 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a bad
thing to have the flu.

00:25:01.305 --> 00:25:05.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just in our
lifestyle, we just

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.986 align:middle line:84%
can't do without having the
go, go, go all the time.

00:25:08.986 --> 00:25:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you just have
to take the time for it.

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.700 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about the
consciousness of it too.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So as a matter of fact,
when I started digging

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.620 align:middle line:84%
into the literature
way back in 1964,

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.890 align:middle line:84%
scientists were finding
out that actually bacteria

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:90%
actually eat viruses.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And they found that
bacteria actually

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.884 align:middle line:90%
create their own antimicrobials.

00:25:32.884 --> 00:25:34.550 align:middle line:84%
They're basically
their own antibiotics.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.710 align:middle line:84%
The antibiotics that
we know now are only

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:41.220 align:middle line:84%
created by one sector of
microbes, basically the yeasts.

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:84%
But bacteria and
viruses and parasites,

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:48.090 align:middle line:84%
they all emit chemicals
to kill each other.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And the most
powerful of the bunch

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:54.480 align:middle line:84%
is the bacteria, where the
yeast create antibiotics we now

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.620 align:middle line:84%
know as penicillin
and rifampisin.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.050 align:middle line:84%
The bacteria create these
small polypeptides called

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:04.310 align:middle line:84%
bacteriocins, and they're
extremely powerful.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And once these bacteria start
creating these bacteriocins,

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:10.480 align:middle line:84%
it eats up these
viruses like crazy.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.009 align:middle line:84%
We have a species
of lactobacillus

00:26:14.009 --> 00:26:16.550 align:middle line:84%
that creates these bacteriocins
that have been scientifically

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:20.400 align:middle line:84%
proven to eat up double-stranded
DNA viruses, which are mainly

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:24.180 align:middle line:84%
the flu viruses and
the herpes viruses.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So upon contact, you
don't need a vaccine.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:30.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you don't
need a vaccine at all.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.780 align:middle line:84%
You just start
creating a body that

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:84%
helps create these lactobacilli,
or you take these bacteriocins

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.840 align:middle line:84%
into your body just through
like droplets of water,

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.510 align:middle line:90%
and the viruses get eaten away.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how
do you do that?

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:45.971 align:middle line:90%
What form do the come in?

00:26:45.971 --> 00:26:47.000 align:middle line:90%
How do you take these?

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Our form is called
the ProAlive Probiotic,

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.260 align:middle line:90%
and you just take little drops.

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.030 align:middle line:84%
If you ever go to Mexico and
you get Montezuma's Revenge,

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:58.815 align:middle line:84%
you'll know what one little
droplet of water or bacteria

00:26:58.815 --> 00:26:59.315 align:middle line:90%
is doing.

00:26:59.315 --> 00:27:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, or even the ice.

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:07.270 align:middle line:84%
So these probiotics that say
that oh, it has to be coated

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and it has to get
past your stomach.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that's gone
into Mexico knows

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:14.660 align:middle line:84%
that you get one little droplet
of water on your lettuce,

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.660 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get all
these diarrhea symptoms.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.824 align:middle line:84%
So bacteria can actually go
through the stomach lining

00:27:19.824 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and get into your
small intestines

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.182 align:middle line:84%
and rapidly replicate,
and start producing

00:27:23.182 --> 00:27:24.140 align:middle line:90%
all these bacteriocins.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
saying for example,

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.360 align:middle line:84%
in your company, you're making
one that is just a drop or two,

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.360 align:middle line:84%
would actually go in and
start countering those?

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.193 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:27:32.193 --> 00:27:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And it counters it in
many different ways.

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And I can go into it, but it
counters it mainly chemically

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.630 align:middle line:84%
through the use of
these bacteriocins.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:42.660 align:middle line:84%
But these microbes
are actually trained

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.840 align:middle line:90%
to seek out the viruses.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.880 align:middle line:84%
We train them like Navy SEALs,
and we have a specific way

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.390 align:middle line:84%
of doing it with all these
little red little wells.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And we train them
to eat viruses.

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:54.310 align:middle line:84%
We also train them
to eat toxins.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:57.960 align:middle line:84%
We actually collect rainwater
from Detroit and New

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.050 align:middle line:84%
York and California and
Florida, and we actually

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.460 align:middle line:84%
train these microbes to break
down mercury and arsenic.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Because they'll eat anything.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How interesting.

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:07.550 align:middle line:84%
So that information is
already encoded in them

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:10.420 align:middle line:84%
so they will go into your body
and start doing the same thing.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: That's called our
Active Detox Probiotic,

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:14.680 align:middle line:84%
because they're
plantarums, they're

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:18.500 align:middle line:84%
lactobacillus plantarums in
the family of plantarums, which

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:23.160 align:middle line:84%
actively go out and
eat mercury and arsenic

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.430 align:middle line:84%
and lead because
that's their food.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And when they go into your body,
not only do they replicate,

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:30.200 align:middle line:84%
they actually teach
the other microbes

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.500 align:middle line:84%
what to do through just
like a song, for example.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.490 align:middle line:84%
You may or may not
hate Michael Jackson,

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:38.710 align:middle line:84%
but if anybody hears a
Michael Jackson song,

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:40.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what's in
your head at the time,

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:43.440 align:middle line:84%
you're coming out of there
thinking Michael Jackson.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:47.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's the same thing
with a Mozart song.

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:49.120 align:middle line:90%
Microbes act the same way.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.840 align:middle line:10%
When a strong microbe
starts beating out

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.480 align:middle line:10%
a particular signal,
all the other microbes

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.720 align:middle line:10%
are going to learn from them.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:01.110 align:middle line:10%
And slowly, your symptoms
start to ameliorate

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.554 align:middle line:10%
through the use of
taking these probiotics.

00:29:03.554 --> 00:29:05.470 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So probiotics
is a really good thing

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.600 align:middle line:10%
to do, how about the
consciousness end of it?

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:11.640 align:middle line:10%
Because if stressful thoughts
and thoughts of anger,

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.010 align:middle line:10%
sadness and so forth can allow
negative microbes or bacteria

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:19.350 align:middle line:10%
to replicate more rapidly,
what happens with the opposite?

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.990 align:middle line:10%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:23.270 align:middle line:10%
Well, having good
thoughts and good,

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.490 align:middle line:10%
pleasing thoughts and
surrounding yourself

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:28.300 align:middle line:10%
in an environment
where you're calm

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:31.100 align:middle line:10%
and your body's not stressed
so you don't have your stress

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.730 align:middle line:10%
hormones is very important.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And thinking good thoughts
actually-- Masaru Emoto

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:40.350 align:middle line:84%
actually would
write words of love

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:43.800 align:middle line:84%
on water so you're
drinking structured water.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.850 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people believe
in alkaline water.

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:49.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a real big
believer in alkalinity

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.519 align:middle line:84%
because the body kind
of neutralizes itself.

00:29:52.519 --> 00:29:53.685 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It self-regulates.

00:29:53.685 --> 00:29:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah, it self-regulates.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:56.145 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Although
some people do

00:29:56.145 --> 00:29:58.430 align:middle line:84%
say that if you
go to acidic, you

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:00.360 align:middle line:84%
do end up with certain
chronic diseases.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.472 align:middle line:84%
So do you say it's
something else?

00:30:02.472 --> 00:30:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: I'd say it's
something else.

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:06.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as a microbiologist,
I know for a fact

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.750 align:middle line:84%
that unless you have an acidic
skin, you will get breakouts.

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Unless you have an acidic
gut, you will get fat.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the microbes
that determine slimness,

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.914 align:middle line:84%
it's called bacteroides, can
only live in an acidic gut.

00:30:19.914 --> 00:30:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And here we're doing all
this with alkaline water

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and alkaline foods, everything
to reduce our acidity,

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:27.870 align:middle line:90%
may not be such a great idea.

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Of course, again, it's
in the extreme, isn't it?

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Yeah, it's
in the extreme.

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.349 align:middle line:90%
Everything has to be in balance.

00:30:33.349 --> 00:30:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's talk about
out of balance a little bit,

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:39.400 align:middle line:84%
in terms of let's
say we try, but we

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.096 align:middle line:90%
have a less than optimal diet.

00:30:42.096 --> 00:30:43.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's a lot of people.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they go and have
a latte in the morning

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.460 align:middle line:90%
with a shot of vanilla.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a muffin to go
with that as well.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.140 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be made out
of white bleached flour.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So is there something we can
do to ameliorate those effects

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:02.250 align:middle line:84%
microbially if
we're eating poorly?

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:03.370 align:middle line:90%
What can we do there?

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, the
easiest way to do things

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.190 align:middle line:84%
is start eating foods
that are high in microbes,

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.030 align:middle line:84%
and those are the
fermented foods.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:13.470 align:middle line:84%
So the basic bottom-line
fermented foods

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:17.130 align:middle line:84%
are the yogurts, the
kefirs, and the kombuchas.

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:20.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how good they
will do the average person,

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.189 align:middle line:84%
but they'll do
better than anything.

00:31:22.189 --> 00:31:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there's
kimchi, sauerkraut.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.610 align:middle line:90%
There are, I mean--

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:25.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: The next level--

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -ethnic.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: The next level
are the ethic foods,

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:30.180 align:middle line:84%
are the kimchis and
the sauerkrauts.

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.930 align:middle line:84%
The more sour and
foul-tasting the food is,

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:34.350 align:middle line:90%
it's probably better for you.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:37.140 align:middle line:84%
That's the best
thing that I can say.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hold your nose.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: The Japanese eat this
amazing food called natto,

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's made from fermented
soybeans on rice straw.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And what natto does,
natto is a bacillus

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.110 align:middle line:84%
called bacillus
subtilis, and they

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:54.440 align:middle line:84%
make this slimy goo
that tastes horrible.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.690 align:middle line:84%
But when you eat it,
it actually breaks down

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:58.800 align:middle line:84%
and eats away at all
your arterial plaques

00:31:58.800 --> 00:31:59.800 align:middle line:90%
throughout your body.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And your body starts to-- you
lower your blood pressure,

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.440 align:middle line:90%
your cholesterol goes down.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And you see the
Japanese that eat this,

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.200 align:middle line:84%
they hardly have
any disease at all.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:16.340 align:middle line:84%
So the Japanese, they actually
ferment a lot of their foods.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And they ferment a
lot of their drinks.

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:22.075 align:middle line:84%
Like in Okinawa, I was drinking
this wonderful fermented tea

00:32:22.075 --> 00:32:23.570 align:middle line:90%
made of turmeric.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And the turmeric is a root,
it's kind of like a ginger root.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.030 align:middle line:84%
But when you eat it, it's
a natural Cox-2 inhibitor,

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:35.510 align:middle line:90%
so it ameliorates pain.

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:38.140 align:middle line:84%
But it also goes in your brain
and it breaks down the amyloid

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.400 align:middle line:84%
plaque that prevents
Parkinson's disease,

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.140 align:middle line:84%
and it also prevents
Alzheimer's.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's very difficult
to get in your brain.

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.640 align:middle line:84%
The easy way to get it
is by fermenting it.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.410 align:middle line:90%
So the Japanese would--

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
ferment the turmeric?

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: They ferment
the turmeric.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How does that go?

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:52.849 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what form is it?

00:32:52.849 --> 00:32:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, the way that we're
doing it in Ascended Health

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.410 align:middle line:84%
is we're actually
making these foods

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.140 align:middle line:84%
and these concoctions
where we're

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.360 align:middle line:84%
fermenting a lot of
the foods that we eat.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So because you're already
fermenting it in your body--

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.010 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't know, because
when you're eating food

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:09.780 align:middle line:84%
the act of the
bacterial breakdown

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:13.630 align:middle line:84%
in your body in the absence of
oxygen is called fermentation.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:15.340 align:middle line:90%
So you're already fermenting it.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So when we're fermenting
it on the outside using

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:20.910 align:middle line:84%
friendly microbes, what
your body's already getting

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:24.440 align:middle line:84%
is the secondary metabolites and
it's already being broken down.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And the microbes inside
your body are going,

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.230 align:middle line:84%
wow, I don't have to
do my job anymore,

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:31.780 align:middle line:84%
so I don't have to expend the
energy breaking this down.

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to break it down
into the further constituents,

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.210 align:middle line:84%
the real constituents
that actually help

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.420 align:middle line:84%
your body, the ones
that-- these microbes,

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.750 align:middle line:84%
they actually will
make the antioxidants.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:43.240 align:middle line:84%
They will make the
skin protective layer.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.320 align:middle line:84%
We actually have
over 600 species

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.650 align:middle line:90%
of microbes on our face.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And once you start looking and
getting the healthy microbes

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.510 align:middle line:84%
and you put it on
your face, your face

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:59.530 align:middle line:84%
starts to look
like a child again.

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:01.329 align:middle line:84%
I surf all the time

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:05.724 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:34:05.724 --> 00:34:07.015 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea how old you are.

your skin is like a child's.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.639 align:middle line:84%
It's so shiny and
clear and beautiful.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:20.580 align:middle line:90%
a belief system.

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.312 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, your skin is 25.

00:34:22.312 --> 00:34:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Thank you.

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know that my
skin didn't always used

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.770 align:middle line:90%
to be this way.

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at my skin
from the point of view

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:32.410 align:middle line:84%
of the microbes,
so my wife and I,

00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:35.370 align:middle line:84%
we don't use any products
that would actually

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:36.780 align:middle line:90%
kill the microbes on our skin.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:40.749 align:middle line:84%
We actually looked
into saying, OK, skin,

00:34:40.749 --> 00:34:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and the microbes that live
on your skin, what can

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:43.949 align:middle line:90%
we do to help you?

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the skin that
actually makes the compounds

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.380 align:middle line:84%
that actually activate the
genes to turn on the collagen

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.260 align:middle line:90%
and to turn on the elastins.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have a
lot of women's ears,

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and men's probably, who
have just perked up to this.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: OK, so what
people don't know

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:02.410 align:middle line:84%
is that there were
certain herbs that people

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:06.760 align:middle line:84%
use to actually enhance
the collagen in your face.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.230 align:middle line:84%
But they don't
work all that well.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And people are going, wow,
I tried all these herbs

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and I tried all this collagen,
I tried all this hyaluronic acid

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:15.760 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't work that well.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it worked
for a little while.

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, how would you like it if
the genes for hyaluronic acid

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:24.740 align:middle line:84%
and the genes for collagen
and the genes for elastin

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.699 align:middle line:84%
were actually turned
on inside your skin?

00:35:26.699 --> 00:35:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that'd be good.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.906 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: And guess what?

00:35:28.906 --> 00:35:29.942 align:middle line:90%
The microbes do that.

00:35:29.942 --> 00:35:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: How would you like it
if a protective layer of sebum

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.560 align:middle line:84%
was actually made on
your skin that actually

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.880 align:middle line:90%
repairs the damage done by UV?

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.940 align:middle line:90%
The microbes do that.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we're putting
stuff on our face

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:48.437 align:middle line:84%
to kill the natural microbes,
to kill the very things that

00:35:48.437 --> 00:35:49.020 align:middle line:90%
are actually--

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that starts when
you put soap on your face,

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:52.780 align:middle line:84%
washing your face with
soap and harsh cleansers.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.904 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: And harsh cleansers.

00:35:53.904 --> 00:35:57.506 align:middle line:90%


00:35:57.506 --> 00:35:59.960 align:middle line:84%
The acne medicine,
I forgot what it's

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.480 align:middle line:84%
called, but the acne
medicine that actually kills

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.210 align:middle line:84%
all the bacteria, not
just the bad bacteria,

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.570 align:middle line:90%
but the good bacteria.

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:11.290 align:middle line:84%
So when the bacteria we-- we're
actually making concoctions now

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:12.630 align:middle line:90%
in our skin care line.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.110 align:middle line:84%
We have this oil called
the I Am Beautiful oil

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and we actually put these
microbial components in there

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.360 align:middle line:84%
where we actually mixed the
microbes with these herbs.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And the microbes
break down these herbs

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.550 align:middle line:90%
and make a slimy goo.

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And then we put them in an oil
and you put them on your face

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and this I Am Beautiful oil
gets subjected in your face

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and it literally feels
like your skin is glowing,

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.750 align:middle line:84%
and it feels like
your skin is growing.

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:41.764 align:middle line:84%
And I can't describe it,
and I can't prove it.

00:36:41.764 --> 00:36:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's
really the microbes

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:45.860 align:middle line:90%
that are-- what are they doing?

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.590 align:middle line:84%
You're just feeding them
what they need and they're

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:50.001 align:middle line:90%
starting to produce--

00:36:50.001 --> 00:36:52.125 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: They're actually
producing the antioxidants.

00:36:52.125 --> 00:36:54.630 align:middle line:84%
They are actually
producing the compounds

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:56.820 align:middle line:84%
that prevent the collagen
from breaking down,

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:59.390 align:middle line:84%
because they need the
collagen to actually prevent--

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:02.610 align:middle line:84%
there's an enzyme
called collagenase that

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:04.250 align:middle line:90%
increases as we get older.

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And collagenase means
it breaks down collagen.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Elastinase means
it breaks elastin.

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why it
increases as it gets older

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.240 align:middle line:84%
is because the microbes on
your face, as we get older,

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.170 align:middle line:84%
start to decrease because of
all the products that we have.

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:21.660 align:middle line:84%
So you put the same microbes
that you had on your face

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.000 align:middle line:84%
when you were 18,
and guess what?

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.522 align:middle line:84%
All that stuff
starts to go away.

00:37:25.522 --> 00:37:26.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we're seeing.

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wow, that
is fascinating.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And you also have protocols
for teeth and gums,

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:35.990 align:middle line:84%
but before we get to
that because that's

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:37.500 align:middle line:84%
another story, a
fascinating story.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And I've been using this
toothpaste for about a year.

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:40.225 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah, the Oralive.

00:37:40.225 --> 00:37:40.770 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:41.395 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:41.395 --> 00:37:42.231 align:middle line:90%
It looks like mud.

00:37:42.231 --> 00:37:43.730 align:middle line:84%
You're brushing
your teeth with mud.

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:45.970 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about that
story, but let's talk

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:48.400 align:middle line:84%
about the notion
of how they have

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.740 align:middle line:84%
eat right type for
your blood type,

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.840 align:middle line:84%
eat right for your
metabolic type;

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.800 align:middle line:84%
you're saying that
what's really important

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.387 align:middle line:84%
is to eat right for
your microbe type.

00:37:59.387 --> 00:38:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk about
that for a minute because here

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:08.149 align:middle line:84%
you have the one size fits all
if you eat a vegan, raw diet,

00:38:08.149 --> 00:38:09.440 align:middle line:90%
you're going to live to be 100.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, some people
would die on that diet.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Same thing, the Paleo Diet,
others aren't compatible.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.444 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about it from
a microbial point of view.

00:38:18.444 --> 00:38:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: From the
microbial point of view,

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:22.090 align:middle line:84%
in order to eat
a raw vegan diet,

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:24.350 align:middle line:84%
you actually have to
have the right microbes.

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And these microbes are
from a microbe type,

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.990 align:middle line:84%
let's call them rumen
type because they

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:33.310 align:middle line:84%
are good at breaking
down cellulose.

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Approximately 20% percent
of the-- this whole science

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.190 align:middle line:90%
is brand new.

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, literally.

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:42.210 align:middle line:84%
This study came out
in July of 2012,

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:43.715 align:middle line:90%
and also another study in 2011.

00:38:43.715 --> 00:38:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Brand new, OK.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: They're starting to
find out that at the moment,

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:51.660 align:middle line:84%
at this time, we can break
down that the human body has

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.460 align:middle line:84%
three types of
microbes in our gut.

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:57.490 align:middle line:84%
We have the F type, the
Firmiculites, F for fat.

00:38:57.490 --> 00:38:59.620 align:middle line:84%
If you have a predominance
of this F type,

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.620 align:middle line:84%
you get fat, because
these microbes

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:04.120 align:middle line:84%
are really good at breaking
down the simple sugars

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.800 align:middle line:84%
and assimilating the simple
sugars inside your body.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the
B type for bony.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Those are called the
Bacteroidetes, or something

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.180 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.350 align:middle line:90%
I can't say it right now.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's the B type for
bony, and those people

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.690 align:middle line:90%
tend to be lean.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
R type for the rumens.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.650 align:middle line:90%
Those are like the cows.

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:22.540 align:middle line:84%
They eat the raw foods
and the cellulose.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But the people that are lean
have a high predominance

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:29.360 align:middle line:84%
of the B type
microbes in your body.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
shift the obesity

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:36.770 align:middle line:84%
to lean barrier by increasing
the amount of B type microbes

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:39.320 align:middle line:84%
in your body, because they're
very good at breaking down

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.460 align:middle line:84%
proteins and complex
carbohydrates.

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is they
break them down for energy,

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and they don't
get stored as fat.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: The way they found
this out was in 2008,

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:54.950 align:middle line:84%
a scientist by the name of
Jeremy Nicholson from Oxford,

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:57.670 align:middle line:84%
England, produced a
study in "Nature,"

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:00.250 align:middle line:84%
which is the most prestigious
journal in the world,

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:04.200 align:middle line:84%
trying to find out the
most-- healthiest people

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.450 align:middle line:90%
in the planet.

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at five
different regions.

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:12.130 align:middle line:84%
He looked at the United States,
the United Kingdom, Japan,

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:15.440 align:middle line:84%
China, and areas
of Eastern Europe.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
Balkans and so forth.

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And he found out there were,
ah, an area of the world where

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:24.300 align:middle line:84%
people lived the
shortest, and there

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.830 align:middle line:84%
was an area of the world
that lived the longest.

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.249 align:middle line:84%
And guess where the
people lived the shortest?

00:40:29.249 --> 00:40:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: US?

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Houston, Texas.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:39.000 align:middle line:84%
They had a diet basically of
dead animal flesh and a lot

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.610 align:middle line:84%
of fat and a lot
of processed foods,

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:44.160 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of foods that were
actually genetically modified,

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:47.080 align:middle line:84%
and foods that were
laden with hormones.

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Versus this area in
southern China called Yunan,

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.040 align:middle line:84%
people were so poor they
couldn't afford meat,

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.660 align:middle line:84%
so they were kind
of like vegetarians

00:40:55.660 --> 00:41:00.340 align:middle line:90%
not by choice, but by economics.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And they fermented a
lot of their foods,

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:04.340 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't
refrigerate a lot of foods.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So they eated a lot of
microbes in their foods,

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.560 align:middle line:84%
but they ate a lot
of complex starches

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and complex carbohydrates
in their diet.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And they found out
that these people

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:16.770 align:middle line:84%
lived to an average
age of like 78 years.

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And they had very low
incidence of diabetes,

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.360 align:middle line:84%
had very low incidence
of heart disease,

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.800 align:middle line:84%
had very low
incidence of cancer.

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Versus the ones in the United
States based on their microbes,

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.150 align:middle line:84%
they had a high
incidence of diabetes,

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.930 align:middle line:84%
they had a high
incidence of obesity,

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:36.650 align:middle line:84%
had a high incidence of heart
disease, and high incidence

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:37.540 align:middle line:90%
of cancer.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were apt to live
only till about 72 years.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:42.630 align:middle line:84%
It got to the point
where these scientists,

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.840 align:middle line:84%
they found out what
microbe type you are just

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.470 align:middle line:84%
by measuring the
metabolites in your urine.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And they called it
originally the metabolome.

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:51.785 align:middle line:90%
It's now called a microbiome.

00:41:51.785 --> 00:41:53.410 align:middle line:84%
The metabolome,
because the metabolites

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:55.800 align:middle line:84%
determined the kind of microbes
that you had in your gut

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.660 align:middle line:84%
that were producing
the metabolites.

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And so by looking at the
microbe type, they can tell,

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.690 align:middle line:84%
they go, we don't even
know where these people are

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:07.090 align:middle line:84%
because of the microbes
they had in their urine

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and in their body,
we know that they're

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:11.340 align:middle line:90%
going to live till about 72.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.510 align:middle line:84%
They're going to die of
either heart disease, cancer,

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:17.780 align:middle line:84%
or diabetes, or versus they're
going to die of old age,

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:21.600 align:middle line:84%
they're going to die of
a fall or something like.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:25.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's down to a science
now that basically

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:27.380 align:middle line:84%
based on the kind
of microbes that you

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:29.400 align:middle line:84%
have in your gut,
scientists can actually

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.442 align:middle line:84%
tell when you're
going to die and what

00:42:31.442 --> 00:42:32.400 align:middle line:90%
you're going to die of.

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.774 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now that's interesting
because you were talking

00:42:34.774 --> 00:42:38.120 align:middle line:84%
about metabolic
type a moment ago.

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:42.170 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like the metabolic
type might more closely

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:46.110 align:middle line:84%
align with the microbial type
diet than, say, the blood type.

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Or is it all kind
of interconnected?

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: It's all interconnected.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.070 align:middle line:84%
The main difference between the
metabolic type and the blood

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:55.560 align:middle line:84%
type is you cannot
choose your blood type.

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.640 align:middle line:84%
If you're blood type
A versus blood type O,

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.390 align:middle line:90%
you're born with that.

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:02.550 align:middle line:84%
The metabolic type, if
you're a high metabolic rate

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:06.380 align:middle line:84%
versus a low metabolic rate
versus a meso metabolic rate,

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:07.832 align:middle line:90%
you can't change that.

00:43:07.832 --> 00:43:09.540 align:middle line:84%
The beautiful thing
with the microbe type

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.160 align:middle line:90%
is you can completely change it.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can.

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:14.615 align:middle line:84%
And you were also talking
about how in Houston they

00:43:14.615 --> 00:43:17.160 align:middle line:84%
ate a lot of, I think you
said dead animal flesh,

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:21.040 align:middle line:84%
but in reality, most of the
population on the planet

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.780 align:middle line:90%
eat some kind of animal protein.

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:23.613 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:43:23.613 --> 00:43:29.055 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that is necessary
for one or two of the--

00:43:29.055 --> 00:43:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Microbe types.

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:30.370 align:middle line:90%

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Animal flesh and
animal protein is

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:36.390 align:middle line:84%
very necessary for one or
two of the microbe types.

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:40.487 align:middle line:84%
And when I say dead animal
flesh, I personally eat meat,

00:43:40.487 --> 00:43:42.070 align:middle line:84%
but I don't like to
eat a lot of meat.

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly
don't eat meat that's

00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:47.620 align:middle line:84%
been unconsciously raised,
because the steroids

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:50.030 align:middle line:84%
in the meat and the
consciousness in which

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.825 align:middle line:84%
that meat was raised, it's
actually in the bloodstream

00:43:52.825 --> 00:43:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and is carried on
through little molecules.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So I like to eat meat that was
grass fed and humanely raised.

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Given that, we can
change the microbe type.

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:06.200 align:middle line:84%
We know that we can change
the microbe type because they

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.260 align:middle line:84%
can actually transfer
microbes from one

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:11.390 align:middle line:84%
human to another human and
completely shift the way

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:13.050 align:middle line:90%

You got to know that raw food is
frowned upon by the government

because, truthfully,
raw food if it's

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:49.810 align:middle line:84%
handled by the wrong

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:52.090 align:middle line:90%
could have bad bacteria in it.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:54.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big believer in raw food.

But when the bacteria

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:10.280 align:middle line:84%
they will actually
create this food

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:13.150 align:middle line:84%
into a living raw food
again, because they're

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:15.510 align:middle line:84%
breaking the food down
and they're excreting it,

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:18.110 align:middle line:90%

They can go check out your site

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:32.000 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about what
happens in the mouth.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So many people have breakdowns
in the mouth and are-- I mean,

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:37.870 align:middle line:84%
all the new technology
in dentistry

00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:39.889 align:middle line:84%

Oh, if you lose your
teeth that's OK.

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:43.000 align:middle line:84%
We'll just peg a
new one in there.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.780 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening on a
bacteria level in the mouth?

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.560 align:middle line:10%
>>ROM: On a bacterial
levels so far identified

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:52.970 align:middle line:10%
are about 800 different species
of microbes that naturally live

00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:56.700 align:middle line:10%
in the mouth, and they
naturally call the oral cavity

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:57.560 align:middle line:10%
their home.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:59.470 align:middle line:10%
And believe it or
not, the microbes

00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:01.380 align:middle line:10%
that live inside the
mouth are completely

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:03.930 align:middle line:10%
different from the microbes
that live on our skin, which

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:06.550 align:middle line:10%
are completely different
from the microbes in our gut.

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:08.790 align:middle line:10%
The microbes in our
gut is like the ocean.

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:10.340 align:middle line:10%
The microbes in our
mouth is kind of

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:14.189 align:middle line:10%
like the edge of the oceans,
kind of like the beach.

00:49:14.189 --> 00:49:15.730 align:middle line:10%
And again, there
are different plants

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:19.700 align:middle line:10%
that grow on the edge of the
beach versus down in the ocean.

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:21.550 align:middle line:10%
And the microbes
that are on our skin

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:23.950 align:middle line:10%
is kind of like the desert.

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:28.330 align:middle line:84%
The microbes in our armpits
is kind of like the jungle.

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:30.810 align:middle line:90%
And they're different microbes.

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:33.800 align:middle line:84%
You and I are more closely
related genetically

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:38.190 align:middle line:84%
than the microbes on my skin are
to the microbes inside my nose

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and the microbes
inside my mouth.

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:42.230 align:middle line:84%
They are so different
genetically.

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So you have to imagine that the
microbial species in the mouth

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:48.480 align:middle line:90%
are there to protect the mouth.

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.760 align:middle line:84%
They need that
mouth to be healthy.

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And every time we
take in products

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:56.109 align:middle line:84%
that kill all the microbes,
these antiseptic mouthwashes,

00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:57.900 align:middle line:84%
every time they take
them in, they actually

00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:59.330 align:middle line:90%
kill all the microbes.

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:01.210 align:middle line:90%
It's really bad for you.

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:02.990 align:middle line:84%
It kills all the
microbes in your mouth.

00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
any time you take

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:06.910 align:middle line:84%
in the next spoonful
of food that you're

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:08.700 align:middle line:84%
taking in your
mouth, it's actually

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:13.040 align:middle line:84%
filled with millions of microbes
that don't live in the mouth.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So when you clean your mouth
out and sterilize your mouth out

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:20.850 align:middle line:84%
with these antiseptic
tooth washes, mouthwashes,

00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and these toothpastes that have
this antibiotic in it-- which

00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:29.070 align:middle line:84%
I'll go into that
in a little bit--

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:30.529 align:middle line:84%
it kills out all
the good microbes.

00:50:30.529 --> 00:50:32.111 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
eat the bad microbes

00:50:32.111 --> 00:50:34.480 align:middle line:84%
through your next burger or
through your next milkshake,

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.819 align:middle line:90%
they set up shop in your mouth.

00:50:36.819 --> 00:50:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have
anything that-- there's

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:42.100 align:middle line:84%
no one there to
defend the territory.

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And no wonder the pockets
inside your mouth gets

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:47.110 align:middle line:84%
filled with these
anaerobic bacteria.

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So what we found is by flooding
your mouth with the microbes

00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:53.200 align:middle line:84%
that naturally live in there
and gotten from the people that

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.920 align:middle line:84%
have no tooth decay, those
are really strong microbes.

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:58.080 align:middle line:84%
We have a product called
Oralive that actually

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.370 align:middle line:84%
have these like
microbial products

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:02.580 align:middle line:84%
in the mouth that
actually set up

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:05.200 align:middle line:84%
shop for these microbes,
the natural microbes

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.030 align:middle line:84%
to start rebuilding
themselves and set up

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.740 align:middle line:90%
their defenses again.

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.489 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's
another rub to that.

00:51:09.489 --> 00:51:11.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been using
that for about a year.

00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And initially, you look in
the jar, it looks like mud

00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:18.650 align:middle line:90%
and it's a little bit gritty.

00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, you don't
just brush your teeth with it.

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.990 align:middle line:84%
You actually swish it
around in your mouth

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:26.156 align:middle line:84%
when you put the water in
where you'd normally rinse

00:51:26.156 --> 00:51:27.935 align:middle line:84%
and spit out, and
then you drink that.

00:51:27.935 --> 00:51:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: You swallow it.

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you swallow it.

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:32.680 align:middle line:90%
Now I do that.

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not gross
or anything like that,

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:37.700 align:middle line:84%
but that's starting to
repopulate down into the guts

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:39.280 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So when most people
think about spitting out

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:45.630 align:middle line:84%
the toothpaste or doing this
practice called oil pulling,

00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:47.700 align:middle line:84%
where you spit out
this sesame oil,

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.820 align:middle line:84%
you're spitting out
all the bad microbes.

00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:52.140 align:middle line:84%
But when you're eating an
apple-- think about it.

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:53.598 align:middle line:84%
When you're eating
an apple, you're

00:51:53.598 --> 00:51:55.900 align:middle line:84%
literally brushing your
teeth because you're

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:57.930 align:middle line:84%
scraping all the
bacteria off of your gums

00:51:57.930 --> 00:51:59.180 align:middle line:90%
and then you swallow it.

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically like
swallowing toothpaste.

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:06.085 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather imparted a note
of wisdom to me before he died.

00:52:06.085 --> 00:52:08.210 align:middle line:84%
He basically said, don't
put anything in your mouth

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:10.300 align:middle line:90%
that you have to spit out.

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.450 align:middle line:90%
He was a Jehovah's Witness.

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:12.870 align:middle line:90%
He didn't like taking in drugs.

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:14.549 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's good advice.

00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:16.340 align:middle line:84%
But then, you better
be diligent about what

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.580 align:middle line:84%
you put in your
mouth to begin with.

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:18.751 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:52:18.751 --> 00:52:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And what the
toothpaste we have now,

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:24.270 align:middle line:84%
the fluoride in your mouth,
that's not the only way to kill

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:26.900 align:middle line:90%
cavities.

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.930 align:middle line:84%
The American Dental
Association and the industry

00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:32.600 align:middle line:84%
would have us think that
fluoride is the only way

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:34.940 align:middle line:84%
to kill cavities and to
keep your mouth fresh,

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:37.680 align:middle line:84%
when it's actually
one of many ways.

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually one
of the poorer ways

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.640 align:middle line:84%
to actually kill
cavities in your mouth.

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
almost out of time.

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:45.520 align:middle line:90%
We could, in fact-- OK.

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:48.230 align:middle line:90%
We will talk again.

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:49.450 align:middle line:90%
We have just a minute left.

00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Can you just give us an
idea, in bullet form,

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:54.502 align:middle line:84%
is there something really
exciting on the horizon,

00:52:54.502 --> 00:52:56.210 align:middle line:84%
because you're really
learning new things

00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:57.494 align:middle line:90%
by the day in this field.

00:52:57.494 --> 00:52:58.910 align:middle line:84%
You're one of the
top researchers.

00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:03.280 align:middle line:10%
>>ROM: Well, we're working
with Arizona State University

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:07.600 align:middle line:10%
and their Biodesign Institute
and several other scientists

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.590 align:middle line:10%
around the world to
actually research

00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:12.640 align:middle line:10%
the effects of the
microbes in the body

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.220 align:middle line:10%
and determining which
microbes are the right microbe

00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.406 align:middle line:10%
type for the body.

00:53:16.406 --> 00:53:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Because once you determine
your right microbe type,

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:21.890 align:middle line:84%
you can actually go back in
time and look at the microbes

00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:25.950 align:middle line:84%
that you had when you were
well and you were young.

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
recreate that for your body.

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:35.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Compton.

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:38.369 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I bet you
were sketching out notes

00:53:38.369 --> 00:53:40.140 align:middle line:90%
as fast as you possibly can.

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And remember that you can
always watch this again

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.370 align:middle line:90%
in our Gaiam archives.

00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:46.920 align:middle line:84%
This interview will be available
at the end of this week.

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.169 align:middle line:84%
And then you can share it
with your friends and family

00:53:49.169 --> 00:53:50.500 align:middle line:90%
and go over it again.

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, we'll be seeing a lot
more of Compton in the future

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:57.400 align:middle line:84%
as more microbiome science
is emerging every single day.

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.320 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:02.210 align:middle line:84%
