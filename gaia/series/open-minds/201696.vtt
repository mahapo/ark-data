>> REGINA MEREDITH: The
one artifact in the field

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.830 align:middle line:10%
of ufology that's created the
most controversy to this day is

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.900 align:middle line:10%
called the "Alien Autopsy."

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a film in which
a medical team is

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.980 align:middle line:90%
dissecting a little alien body.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.850 align:middle line:84%
It's been declared as one of the
biggest hoaxes in UFO history.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.892 align:middle line:90%
But is it?

00:00:36.892 --> 00:00:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to
talk with a man who

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.170 align:middle line:84%
is privy to the original
film more than 25 years ago,

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Maurizio Baiata, along with our
in-house UFO researcher, Paola

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:90%
Harris.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.960 align:middle line:90%
Paola, welcome.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Maurizio, welcome.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:90%
This has been crazy.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm listening to you guys
speaking in Italian here,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.340 align:middle line:84%
so I don't have any
idea what's going on.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.852 align:middle line:90%
>> PAOLA HARRIS: Ciao, Maurizio.

00:00:57.852 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>> MAURIZIO BAIATA: Ciao, Paola.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Ciao, everybody.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.827 align:middle line:90%
Ciao!

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm happy
to have you here.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be a
fascinating discussion.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Maurizio was
my boss for 20 years,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.117 align:middle line:84%
so it's like old home
week, a big reunion for me.

00:01:10.117 --> 00:01:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about
that for a moment, Paola.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.620 align:middle line:90%
Your boss in what context?

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.600 align:middle line:84%
So people understand
your relationship

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:90%
to Maurizio and the whole story.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yeah.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.860 align:middle line:10%
Actually, I moved to
Italy for 15 years, 1994.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I just
returned in 2007.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And while I was there,
Maurizio had found out

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:84%
that I had worked
with J. Allen Hynek.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.055 align:middle line:90%
So, isn't this true, Maurizio?

00:01:32.055 --> 00:01:33.180 align:middle line:90%
And then he said, well, no.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:10%
You're coming to work for
us at the Futura Agency,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:10%
where we put out "Area
51" magazine and "Xtimes."

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we're
going to send you back

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.450 align:middle line:90%
to America and everywhere.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.030 align:middle line:90%
And you do the stories.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, did Colonel
Corso for you.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.250 align:middle line:90%
At the 50th anniversary, I did--

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.560 align:middle line:84%
I returned to Roswell
several times.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:90%
I did the Michael Wolf case.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was traveling
reporter for this group

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.210 align:middle line:90%
of people that became a family.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.760 align:middle line:90%
So when I left to Italy--

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and I still write for
"Xtimes" magazine,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.280 align:middle line:84%
because that's the only place
I can deposit my stories right

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.310 align:middle line:84%
When I left Italy,
I left to family.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.557 align:middle line:84%
So I'm so excited to
see Maurizio, my boss.

00:02:18.557 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't call him Maurizio,
I always call him boss.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.307 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You always
call him the boss.

00:02:22.307 --> 00:02:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: And he always
called me La Harris, La Harris.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.040 align:middle line:90%
He never called me Paola.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.498 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and I had the
pleasure of meeting Maurizio

00:02:30.498 --> 00:02:33.810 align:middle line:84%
when we were all doing our
story out of Sardinia last year.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.120 align:middle line:84%
We all met together
in Rome, which

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.930 align:middle line:84%
is the first time I
met you face-to-face,

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:90%
which was such a pleasure.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Exactly.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're such a
knowledgeable, and also,

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:84%
just so articulate on the
subject matter of ufology.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And I would like you
to tell the audience

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.600 align:middle line:84%
a little bit, Maurizio,
about how you ended up

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.870 align:middle line:84%
becoming involved in the
subject of extraterrestrials,

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.130 align:middle line:90%
UFOs and so forth.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Because in Italy, it's
taken much more seriously

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.010 align:middle line:84%
by the populace at large than
it is in the United States.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Our government has kept it in
the area of the giggle factor

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's just now
starting to come out.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.520 align:middle line:90%
So tell us, how did this happen?

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.190 align:middle line:90%
How did you get involved?

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.390 align:middle line:10%
>> BAIATA: I was involved with
this type of research just

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.620 align:middle line:10%
because I'm a journalist.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.230 align:middle line:84%
I was born as a
journalist, basically,

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.270 align:middle line:90%
as a music journalist.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And I started writing in the
very early '70s regarding rock

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:90%
and roll, and so far, so on.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Then when I moved
to United States

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of
the '80s, I found

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.220 align:middle line:84%
myself involved in a
different type of, let's say,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.830 align:middle line:84%
environment, because
I had to face myself

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.240 align:middle line:84%
with the reality of
investigative journalism,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.170 align:middle line:84%
which, in Italy at the time,
we didn't know what really was,

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.970 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, wait a second.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.560 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you a quick question.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Investigating other journalists,
or in investigative journalism?

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Investigative
journalist.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: I am a journalist
still for the American Guild

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.070 align:middle line:90%
of Newspapers.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, that helps us understand.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.350 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: And you know, music
is a field where you can have

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.310 align:middle line:84%
the chance to meet
lots of people,

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.970 align:middle line:84%
very interesting people, such
as, for instance, David Bowie,

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.580 align:middle line:84%
who for me, was sort of an
alien in his type of creativity

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.710 align:middle line:90%
and so far, so on.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I was
already into ufology

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.430 align:middle line:84%
in these studies of
what is there, you know?

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.680 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to understand that.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And my attitude was
search, research,

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.440 align:middle line:84%
check the sources,
and then in case,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.730 align:middle line:84%
write it for a
newspaper or a magazine.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.400 align:middle line:84%
When I got back to
Italy, I had the chance

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.260 align:middle line:90%
to open a couple of magazines.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.262 align:middle line:84%
And the stories went
so far and so on.

00:05:07.262 --> 00:05:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thank you
for explaining that,

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.095 align:middle line:84%
so everybody has a chance
to know you a bit better.

00:05:11.095 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:84%
So essentially,
hardcore journalist.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.210 align:middle line:84%
So checking facts,
rechecking facts,

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:84%
checking sources is really
critical to your job.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And so we're about to go down
a rabbit hole that I don't know

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.970 align:middle line:84%
anyone could have ever fully
checked out, because it has

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.460 align:middle line:90%
the strangest bedfellows, OK?

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Here, we're talking
about throwing

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.160 align:middle line:84%
in a little bit of a search
for Elvis Presley film,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.980 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of Steven
Spielberg claiming he

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.700 align:middle line:84%
has alien video, and other
filmmakers and journalists

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and military, and
everything else involved.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So I hardly know where to
begin with this, so let's

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.210 align:middle line:90%
start at the beginning.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.020 align:middle line:84%
So how did you
originally find out

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.980 align:middle line:84%
about the existence of
original footage, which

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.530 align:middle line:84%
then later became a
template for a film that

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.650 align:middle line:90%
was then labeled a hoax?

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Well, the beginning
of the beginning was a telefax.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, at that time, we
didn't have any other type

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:90%
of communication situations.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And in that teletype, somebody
said that Steven Spielberg

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:25.670 align:middle line:84%
had acquired some rolls,
original rolls of film,

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.680 align:middle line:90%
original film, you know?

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.410 align:middle line:90%
Not video stuff.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And this material contained
the images of an alien autopsy.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So what I wanted to understand
was if this story was for real.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.920 align:middle line:90%
So we checked it with--

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:84%
from Italy, we checked it
with the production company

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.640 align:middle line:90%
of Spielberg.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.890 align:middle line:90%
Nobody gave us an answer.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:84%
So I understood either
Spielberg was lying,

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:84%
or he was just going
a little too fast.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.270 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's my point.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.630 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
Spielberg was involved

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.490 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning of this story.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.950 align:middle line:84%
But then he magically
disappeared,

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and the next guy came out of
the blue and into the scene,

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:90%
was Ray Santilli.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Tell us now--

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Maurizio, first of all, was
this around 1994, '93, '94?

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Sure.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 1994?

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Yes.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A little
over 25 years ago?

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.930 align:middle line:90%
Now, so we kind of have it set.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So Steven Spielberg
was very, very

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.960 align:middle line:90%
highly developed in his career.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And if anyone was at a
high enough profile level

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.890 align:middle line:84%
to have maybe obtained this
financially and otherwise

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.810 align:middle line:84%
through back channels,
it could have, possibly.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: It could.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.535 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We'll just
leave it at that.

00:07:45.535 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Yeah, yeah, it could.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:55.280 align:middle line:84%
But Spielberg, at a too high
ranking official position,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:84%
in the world of the
big cinema business.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: So somebody else
probably used Santilli,

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:12.080 align:middle line:84%
who was a little lower in the
status quo of the productions

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and distribution of
images and the word.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.755 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So tell us
a little bit about Ray

00:08:16.755 --> 00:08:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Santilli's background, because
all of this kind of hinges

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.180 align:middle line:90%
around him.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Who was this guy?

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Yeah, Santilli
was a documentary producer.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And his special interest
was actually music.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.860 align:middle line:84%
That's why we got in touch,
almost, in the beginning.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Because he was confident
that I understood music.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was, you know, we
shared the same good opinion,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.010 align:middle line:90%
the one to each other.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
were self-confident

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:53.160 align:middle line:84%
that nobody was just, you
know, trekking it around,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.250 align:middle line:90%
if I can say this word.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:59.550 align:middle line:90%
So we met in Cannes in--

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.378 align:middle line:84%
I believe that was between
February or early March 1995.

00:09:04.378 --> 00:09:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In Cannes, France,
where they hold the Cannes Film

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Festival.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Exactly.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.290 align:middle line:84%
It was either Midcom or
MidTV, I don't recall it.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.140 align:middle line:90%
We sat at the Martinez.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.630 align:middle line:90%
We had a lunch.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And he immediately said,
well, Maurizio, you

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:26.040 align:middle line:84%
know, we have to talk about the
footage that I have acquired,

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.210 align:middle line:90%
which is in fact, an autopsy.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.280 align:middle line:84%
He never use the
word alien autopsy.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, I acquired
some materials,

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.650 align:middle line:90%
some material, some film--

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:45.620 align:middle line:84%
original film-- which depicts
the ascension of a being.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.430 align:middle line:90%
That's it, you know?

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:48.230 align:middle line:90%
A being.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me,
you are a ufologist?

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.970 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.850 align:middle line:84%
For the rest of your life,
you're going to be, you know,

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.780 align:middle line:84%
staying with the
doubt of what are

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.200 align:middle line:84%
you going to see one of these
days, when I can show you

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:09.180 align:middle line:84%
the material if you come to
London and I show it to you.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so how much
time passed and before you did

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.940 align:middle line:84%
ultimately go to
London to see the film?

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Maybe a little
more than a month because, I

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:90%
wasn't--

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.740 align:middle line:84%
I arrived in London
on April 2015.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so
shortly thereafter.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.760 align:middle line:90%
So now you arrive in London.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Are you by yourself, or are
there other people present?

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: No I
was just by myself.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you and Ray
Sintilli met at his apartment

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:90%
or his home?

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: No, in his office.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: In his office, OK.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Yeah,
in Balcombe Street,

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.380 align:middle line:90%
he had this not gigantic office.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's get, then,
to the evidence that he showed

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.260 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Because by then, he's
saying that this evidence

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.583 align:middle line:90%
was from the 1940s.

00:10:52.583 --> 00:10:54.250 align:middle line:84%
There was some
presumption it could have

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.462 align:middle line:90%
been from the Roswell crash.

00:10:56.462 --> 00:10:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Others are saying there
were other crashes that

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.430 align:middle line:84%
happened because
they're conflicting

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:05.710 align:middle line:84%
not only stories,
but also visuals, OK?

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what you
saw from these canisters, which

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:13.390 align:middle line:90%
by now, was pretty degenerated.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Yeah the canisters
were lying on his office.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:26.710 align:middle line:84%
There were about 15 or 16,
not too large, actually.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Probably, let's say,
about 20 inches--

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.260 align:middle line:90%
a little more-- 15 inches each.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And each one of them
contained a roll of film

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:45.110 align:middle line:84%
originally, I believe, that
was shot on 16 millimeters.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And there was at three minutes
each reel lent, approximately.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Now he said to me,
Maurizio, have a look here.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle line:90%
So he goes like.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.200 align:middle line:90%
He opened one can.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.450 align:middle line:84%
He goes like this,
and I look into it.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.790 align:middle line:90%
And he's saying, it's decaying.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:07.860 align:middle line:84%
It's oxidizing, and we don't
want to lose all the material.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So most of this material
will go to a laboratory

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.970 align:middle line:90%
where they can try to save it.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:84%
But I already saw stuff
as images containing,

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.710 align:middle line:90%
for instance, Truman was there.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:27.130 align:middle line:84%
The President of the United
States at that time was there.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the
recovery team was

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:36.680 align:middle line:84%
close to a disk in the middle
of nowhere in the desert,

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.480 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And the bodies were
lying out of the disk.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:46.230 align:middle line:90%
He said, I saw all this stuff.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, let me--
let's back up one moment.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.070 align:middle line:84%
He's saying that they
saw the disk, which

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.630 align:middle line:90%
was the site of the crash.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:84%
They saw the bodies
that had been taken out

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and were lying around
it, or had crawled out.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.432 align:middle line:84%
He's saying that President
Truman was present?

00:12:59.432 --> 00:13:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: --was there, yeah.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.098 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He was
present for this?

00:13:02.098 --> 00:13:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So he had been flown
in to witness this?

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.650 align:middle line:84%
This is what he's
saying thus far.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:07.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:09.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's continue from there.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And the recovery
team were the people

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.530 align:middle line:84%
that were taking the bodies
away, because they do--

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Clifford Stone, Paola has done
a lot of work with Clifford.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.360 align:middle line:90%
I've interviewed him.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Clifford Stone has talked to
us in detail about how recovery

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:90%
teams work with UFO crashes.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.840 align:middle line:90%
So let's continue from here.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Well, let's say
that by that time, in 1947,

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:36.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that the American
military were so ready to, you

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:37.510 align:middle line:90%
know--

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.468 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's true.

00:13:38.468 --> 00:13:39.320 align:middle line:90%
That was later.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.520 align:middle line:84%
They started training people
after that to do it properly.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.950 align:middle line:90%
This was ad hoc.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: However, if we
consider that there was

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:84%
a president, a previous accident
occurred in New Mexico and that

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.160 align:middle line:90%
was in San Antonio.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And Paola investigated,
thoroughly, that situation,

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.460 align:middle line:90%
I believe, two years before.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:08.020 align:middle line:90%
Also, this was not Roswell.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.837 align:middle line:84%
Santilli used, wrongly,
the word Scirocco.

00:14:11.837 --> 00:14:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Scirocco?

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: He said scirocco
instead of Socorro.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Santilli told me, Maurizio, all
the information I can give you

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:84%
is taken from a
written statement

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.840 align:middle line:90%
by the original cameraman.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what's
the name of this guy?

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.560 align:middle line:90%
And he's still alive?

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, he's still alive.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.450 align:middle line:84%
He's in his early 80's
and he lives somewhere.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:41.560 align:middle line:84%
I cannot disclose, you know,
his house and whereabout,

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.580 align:middle line:90%
and whatever.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Because we are just, let's
say, respecting the word

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.170 align:middle line:90%
that we gave him, you know?

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Not to disclose his
name and whatever.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:59.110 align:middle line:84%
But at that time in 1947,
he was a military cameraman.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.840 align:middle line:90%
He was a combat camera operator.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, now
let's talk about this,

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.060 align:middle line:84%
because this is where the
story gets sticky and tricky.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Because people are going
to say, hold on a minute.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.840 align:middle line:84%
How did that camera
operator for the military

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.250 align:middle line:90%
make off with this film?

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.360 align:middle line:84%
You would think-- you would
think that it would been--

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.030 align:middle line:84%
would have been in some kind
of very secure vault held

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.360 align:middle line:90%
by the military somewhere.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So what happened
as far as you know?

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: What happened
was that later on in the, I

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:39.950 align:middle line:84%
believe, late '50s, around
'57-'58, this guy was shooting

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.660 align:middle line:90%
lots of concerts.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And actually, he had
footage of Presley.

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Elvis Presley, yeah.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Elvis, exactly.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why they met
him was because Santilli

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:57.660 align:middle line:84%
was looking for Presley
material, Presley footage.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Gotcha.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: So they went.

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:02.510 align:middle line:84%
I believe there
were-- both of them,

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Santilli and Gary
Shoefield, his partner.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.300 align:middle line:84%
They went together,
and they met this guy

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.910 align:middle line:90%
at his house, his home.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And after, this guy said,
OK, this is the stuff

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.910 align:middle line:90%
that I have regarding Presley.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.780 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of it, I have
also some other material

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.420 align:middle line:90%
that I want to show to you.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Before, I was, let's
say, a private operator,

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.900 align:middle line:90%
I was a military operator.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And it happened to me that
I was called by a general

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:43.010 align:middle line:90%
to go and film a UFO crash.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:46.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they didn't use
this word, but said,

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.640 align:middle line:90%
an airplane accident, you know?

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.880 align:middle line:84%
A military airplane
accident which

00:16:52.880 --> 00:17:00.920 align:middle line:84%
occurred in the night
of the 31st of May 1947

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.968 align:middle line:84%
in the area, the
area of Socorro.

00:17:03.968 --> 00:17:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so this is
just a couple of months prior

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.410 align:middle line:84%
to Roswell, the Roswell
crash in July '47?

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: One month
exactly before.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Yeah.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.589 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: So we had
two different locations

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:18.440 align:middle line:84%
and they're not related
at all, you know?

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know who
got there first,

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:24.890 align:middle line:84%
but for sure, this guy,
the cameraman, went there

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.630 align:middle line:90%
and he filmed everything.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Then some months
later, weeks and months

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:35.180 align:middle line:84%
later, he said that he
filmed also the autopsies

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.600 align:middle line:84%
in some other
premises, actually,

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:46.340 align:middle line:84%
in some medical laboratories
or morgues, you know?

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.560 align:middle line:90%
Not on the spot.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.030 align:middle line:84%
On the spot, he said
that he filmed inside

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:57.160 align:middle line:84%
in a tent in the
middle of the desert.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:03.005 align:middle line:84%
He filmed the so-called
metal fragments--

00:18:03.005 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Metal fragments?

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:10.385 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Yeah, they were all
lying on two tables, you know.

00:18:10.385 --> 00:18:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And they were fragments,
but among these fragments

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:24.120 align:middle line:84%
were also the I-beams, actually,
or T-beams, such as like this

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:24.920 align:middle line:90%
and like this.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Are you talking
about like a little laser beam

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.470 align:middle line:90%
device?

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: No.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.313 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there are
just construction parts.

00:18:30.313 --> 00:18:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh,
construction parts.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:32.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:33.792 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Yeah, exactly.

00:18:33.792 --> 00:18:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So let me ask how--

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Very light,
very light material.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
had symbols on them.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so now let me
ask a quick question of Paola.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.770 align:middle line:90%
So Paola, 1945, right?

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:46.913 align:middle line:90%
That was San Antonio.

00:18:46.913 --> 00:18:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: San Antonio,
but it's near Socorro.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:90%
So all that area, yeah.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so then,
end of May '47, Socorro.

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Then Roswell in
early July of '47.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Right.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What was it about
this area that you've been able

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:84%
to discern that created so
much activity and also crashes?

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.700 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Well, the hypothesis
that I'm using is that this is

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:15.980 align:middle line:10%
where the Manhattan Project
was in Trinity White Sands,

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.320 align:middle line:10%
and you know, it's
close to Socorro.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And that opened up not
only the nuclear age,

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.950 align:middle line:84%
but that opened up
a lot of speculation

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.550 align:middle line:84%
as far as this
species on this planet

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:32.260 align:middle line:84%
having become a
dangerous species.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
any kind of bomb,

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.380 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of use
of nuclear power,

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.420 align:middle line:84%
is going to go into
other dimensions.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.700 align:middle line:90%
So this is my hypothesis.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it was what--
the proximity to White Sands,

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.100 align:middle line:90%
but why were they crashing?

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Well, first
of all, in that time,

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.270 align:middle line:84%
there was radar
that were portable.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, portable, they could
go from place to place.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And this radar was used
as a security device

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.080 align:middle line:84%
because the people in the
Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.100 align:middle line:90%
and all those people--

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Fatami-- they were
worried that the Russians

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:11.160 align:middle line:84%
would gain access or knowledge
about what they were doing.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.070 align:middle line:90%
It was top secret.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So these radars would
give information

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.960 align:middle line:84%
if anybody was
going to infiltrate.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.220 align:middle line:90%
But there was another thing.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed that
for a lot of the crashes,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.360 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico has terrible
thunderstorms with thunder

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.160 align:middle line:90%
and lightning.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And there is a time
you don't go there

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:35.960 align:middle line:84%
where it's terrible, more than
anyplace else I've ever been.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So the possibility,
if you're going

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:40.450 align:middle line:84%
to use the hypothesis
that there was a lightning

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and thunderstorm that
brings them down,

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.490 align:middle line:90%
is one that we've used.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And the proximity of
Roswell to not only

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:54.460 align:middle line:84%
White Sands, but the fact
that the Enola Gay and all

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:84%
of 509 bomb squadron
was housed there,

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.230 align:middle line:84%
which was going to drop the
bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.010 align:middle line:84%
interested something
or somebody.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And I can validate that
just through my own research

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.840 align:middle line:84%
as well, and that
military bases seem

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.360 align:middle line:84%
to be where there's always
been a lot of UFO activity,

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.500 align:middle line:84%
especially if you have any
kind of warheads involved.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So this makes sense,
that other species--

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.120 align:middle line:84%
not just one, but
other species--

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.430 align:middle line:84%
were checking in
and keeping an eye

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
on what was going
on here because it

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.993 align:middle line:84%
was about to have
implications on a larger scale

00:21:28.993 --> 00:21:30.910 align:middle line:84%
throughout the cosmos,
perhaps, but certainly,

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:33.280 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system, if
we're going to be detonating

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.477 align:middle line:90%
nuclear bombs and such.

00:21:34.477 --> 00:21:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Well, you
know the thing, Regina,

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:38.727 align:middle line:84%
that's interesting is this is
the history of planet Earth.

00:21:38.727 --> 00:21:41.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not just ufology
because this started

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:44.570 align:middle line:90%
a whole series of events.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And I always say,
just kidding around,

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.930 align:middle line:90%
the ETs are not on vacation.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: So this started
a whole series of historical

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:52.230 align:middle line:90%
events.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at a
historical perspective.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:58.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'm so glad Maurizio's
giving you the details how

00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:59.650 align:middle line:90%
this came about.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Because the UFO community has
so much disinformation on this,

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.170 align:middle line:84%
on this autopsy, how it came
about, so forth, and so on,

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.370 align:middle line:84%
that when he's talking,
it makes perfect sense.

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why I want to be very
clear and detailed on how

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:15.800 align:middle line:90%
he came about seeing it.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.120 align:middle line:90%
OK, thank you for that, Paola.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.540 align:middle line:90%
So Maurizio, back to your story.

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And you finally have a chance
to see some of this footage

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.730 align:middle line:90%
with your own eyes.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
learn that what you saw

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.370 align:middle line:84%
was not what was later reflected
in that reenactment film that

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.590 align:middle line:90%
became known as the hoax.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:38.260 align:middle line:84%
But you saw two
different canisters

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:43.300 align:middle line:84%
of two different events, and
two different kinds of bodies.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
one which we're

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.540 align:middle line:84%
going to show images of,
because you wrote me an email

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.340 align:middle line:90%
this morning.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And you said you called
Wendy and explained

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.100 align:middle line:84%
to her what was going
on in the autopsy

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.265 align:middle line:84%
of this little
female alien body.

00:22:56.265 --> 00:22:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And you were kind
of freaked out.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.310 align:middle line:84%
It was very emotional for you to
relay this information to her.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So now let's--
we've set the stage.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.050 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what you saw.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Well, first
of all, I was not alone.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:11.890 align:middle line:84%
I was with a very nice
guy, a nice fellow,

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.380 align:middle line:90%
whose name was Reg Presley.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.680 align:middle line:90%
And I know that--

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.540 align:middle line:84%
I knew at that time, that guy,
because it was an honor for me

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:25.060 align:middle line:84%
to meet, in person, the
lead singer of a band called

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.030 align:middle line:90%
The Troggs.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: A British band,
very famous in the '60s.

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And Reg was a very good
friend with Santilli.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:42.700 align:middle line:84%
So we went out to lunch
close to Santilli's office.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And then after
lunch, we were just

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.100 align:middle line:84%
sitting on, you know, in front
of this not gigantic monitor

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:57.040 align:middle line:84%
at all, a very humble, old
TV set, and not even big,

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.060 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And Santilli goes like, OK,
now I show you this thing.

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:02.930 align:middle line:90%
I leave you right here.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:03.980 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about that.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And you know, he's
British, but actually, I

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:10.450 align:middle line:84%
don't know why that guy,
when he was talking to me,

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:84%
he didn't ever,
ever use Italian,

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.500 align:middle line:84%
even though maybe he
knew some Italian.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.895 align:middle line:90%
Because Santilli is--

00:24:18.895 --> 00:24:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Santilli's Italian.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: --is Italian, OK?

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:25.680 align:middle line:90%
So I sit there with Reg Presley.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.980 align:middle line:90%
The-- the, uh--

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:31.660 align:middle line:90%
the movie goes on, starts.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.770 align:middle line:90%
And I'm stunned.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I was really destroyed
by what I saw.

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What did you see?

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Well, you know, this
body was just lying on this

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.480 align:middle line:90%
slab.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:49.290 align:middle line:90%
Legs were pretty open.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And and the body
was totally intact.

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:57.510 align:middle line:84%
No-- no damages
at all, you know?

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.460 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.200 align:middle line:90%
This is strange.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.700 align:middle line:90%
Let me see a little better.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.980 align:middle line:90%
OK, six fingers.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.320 align:middle line:84%
That's a main difference
with all the stories

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.580 align:middle line:84%
that we know about the
grays or the humans

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:14.960 align:middle line:84%
with five fingers and the
grays with four fingers.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.620 align:middle line:84%
No, this-- this being, this
creature, had six fingers.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And they were very,
very clearly--

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:27.120 align:middle line:84%
because the ends
were going like this.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw the
feet, six fingers.

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
perfectly detailed.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:36.060 align:middle line:90%
Everything was very natural.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't see anything that, to
me, gave the idea that there

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:44.940 align:middle line:84%
was a puppet or whatever,
there was a construction.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:46.200 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was so
poignant, that Reg,

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:55.860 align:middle line:84%
I believe that he was
starting either crying,

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.825 align:middle line:84%
or he was very, very
emotional, more than me, OK?

00:25:59.825 --> 00:26:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk for
a moment about the facial

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:03.020 align:middle line:90%
features.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Were they more kind of human,
or more gray, or a combination?

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: That's what
I thought, very human.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.750 align:middle line:84%
That's my-- very human,
very close to a human.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But small, small
bodies, small shoulders.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Yeah, small body,
a round-- a very round face.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:32.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, regular mouth, little
nose, and barely visible ears.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing is, that
by then, I'd never

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.790 align:middle line:90%
seen before a real autopsy--

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.380 align:middle line:90%
I mean, on a human being.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.580 align:middle line:90%
So when the guys--

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the doctors--

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.040 align:middle line:90%
one doctor.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.930 align:middle line:90%
I believe there was only one.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there was an
assistant, but I was just

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.230 align:middle line:84%
taken by the doctor activities,
which was very fast.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:56.460 align:middle line:84%
He opened the
chest of this being

00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:00.270 align:middle line:84%
like this with a vertical
incision, all right?

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And then he opened the chest
and exposed the organs,

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.700 align:middle line:84%
like everything done in
very quickly, you know?

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.260 align:middle line:90%
It was quick.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Then, he moved down to
the low abdomen area.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And he inspected
what we had to call

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:24.360 align:middle line:84%
a vagina, which
was already opened

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.240 align:middle line:90%
before because it was stitched.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.548 align:middle line:90%
That really stunned me.

00:27:28.548 --> 00:27:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wait a minute.

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:31.020 align:middle line:90%
It was stitched?

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.190 align:middle line:84%
So the vagina was stitched
closed, so he unstitched it?

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Yep.

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:36.840 align:middle line:90%
On the top of it--

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.990 align:middle line:84%
on the top of it, there
were stitches, you know?

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:43.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
that was, let's say,

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:46.920 align:middle line:84%
a detail that a creator
of special effects

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.670 align:middle line:90%
will ever leave there to--

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was too raw, too raw.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:54.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that was too raw.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And so one would
ostensibly think

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.500 align:middle line:84%
they might have
been looking to see

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:02.240 align:middle line:84%
how the reproductive system may
have worked in these beings?

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Yes.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.720 align:middle line:90%
So the doctor introduced--

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:13.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, put-- inserted in the
vagina, a long, very long,

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:18.360 align:middle line:84%
let's say, it was just
sort of a stick instrument,

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:23.490 align:middle line:84%
probably metallic instrument,
and extracted some filaments--

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:27.810 align:middle line:84%
whitish, white filaments,
going like this.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:29.278 align:middle line:84%
Very strange, very
strange things.

00:28:29.278 --> 00:28:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, now, this
point must have been--

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.183 align:middle line:84%
now at this point,
just emotionally,

00:28:33.183 --> 00:28:34.350 align:middle line:90%
you're already struck on it.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.350 align:middle line:84%
But this has to have been pretty
traumatizing at this point

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.200 align:middle line:90%
to even watch.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Yeah.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, just
hearing about it is--

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Yeah.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And only three or four
minutes after the beginning

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:52.410 align:middle line:84%
of the operation, I was
just going like this.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:53.980 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to say.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:57.800 align:middle line:84%
I was, you know,
mute, totally mute.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.543 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't say anything at all.

00:28:59.543 --> 00:29:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No,
what could you say?

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: And the images
were going on, you know?

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.400 align:middle line:90%
And so they opened--

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.650 align:middle line:84%
the doctor went-- the
surgeon went again

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:15.960 align:middle line:84%
on the chest area, exposed
the internal organs.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And what I remember
distinctively, he got--

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:25.140 align:middle line:84%
with a sort of
instrument, he took out

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:28.270 align:middle line:84%
a triangular shaped
bright object--

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Bright?

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:30.653 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: --which
I don't know what--

00:29:30.653 --> 00:29:36.690 align:middle line:84%
very bright, almost luminous
object from the chest,

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:38.340 align:middle line:90%
from the left side.

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:44.550 align:middle line:84%
What I mean, this is the
creature here on the left, OK?

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:47.610 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know--

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:50.720 align:middle line:84%
then, I believed at
this time, I believed

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:58.610 align:middle line:84%
that either the operation
wasn't completely shot, meaning

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:01.340 align:middle line:90%
that they cut it in sections.

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:05.450 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the entire
duration of this--

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:08.598 align:middle line:10%
of this dissection was
less than 11 minutes.

00:30:08.598 --> 00:30:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they may
have turned the camera off

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.223 align:middle line:84%
for certain parts and then said
start shooting again when they

00:30:13.223 --> 00:30:14.240 align:middle line:90%
got to key bits?

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Yes.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: All right.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:20.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that was the first
film, the 11 minute film

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:25.340 align:middle line:84%
of the female entity that looked
distinctly humanoid but very

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:30.440 align:middle line:84%
slim limbs, six fingers,
humanoid features on the face,

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.625 align:middle line:90%
little female, and short.

00:30:31.625 --> 00:30:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Yeah.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: And no--

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.710 align:middle line:84%
this is important--
no damages at all.

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:39.660 align:middle line:90%
Now I don't recall if this--

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:43.340 align:middle line:84%
on this creature, I
really don't recall if I

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.950 align:middle line:90%
saw the sawing of the crani--

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:48.120 align:middle line:90%
of the skull.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:48.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't--

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.005 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This-- when they
sawed through the cranium?

00:30:51.005 --> 00:30:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Yeah.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:52.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.700 align:middle line:84%
So we'll leave that,
because if you don't recall,

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.090 align:middle line:90%
let's just leave that alone.

00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:59.210 align:middle line:84%
But as you say, the
being was intact.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:05.240 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't-- it didn't die
from any particular impact

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.098 align:middle line:90%
or trauma.

00:31:06.098 --> 00:31:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it was something
else, because we don't even

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:10.940 align:middle line:84%
know what kind of atmosphere
they can survive in

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.650 align:middle line:84%
or what they can
breathe, or anything.

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So they could have
died by any means.

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:15.820 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know, right?

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Mm-hmm.

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Then Reg and I
decided to ask Santilli,

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:27.490 align:middle line:84%
we go like, shall we ask him
to watch it again, please?

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Because 11 minutes went
like, you know, a meteor.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:33.840 align:middle line:90%
And so, yeah.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And Santilli very politely
made us, you know,

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.790 align:middle line:90%
watching it again.

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So-- but then again, I
don't recall exactly.

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:51.730 align:middle line:84%
My account is on the internet,
because when other researchers

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:58.570 align:middle line:84%
wanted to know if I was really
watching the first autopsy

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and the other guys who
show the first autopsy,

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:06.790 align:middle line:84%
meaning Colin Anders,
Philip Mantle, and I don't--

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:09.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't recall the others.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:12.910 align:middle line:84%
We were-- at the
end of the game,

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:18.320 align:middle line:84%
five people had the chance
to see the first autopsy.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: So I went back to
Rome exactly the same day.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:32.980 align:middle line:84%
But before I catch the flight,
I called my wife, Wendy,

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.370 align:middle line:84%
and I described to her
exactly what I saw.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And she
did this picture?

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Exactly.

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And that depicts
exactly, perfectly,

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.148 align:middle line:90%
the body of the first autopsy.

00:32:46.148 --> 00:32:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: All right, Maurizio.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's go to the
second film you saw.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: OK, the
second film that I saw,

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:59.710 align:middle line:84%
we were 200 people getting
together at the Museum

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:02.980 align:middle line:84%
of Roswell at the
center of town.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.810 align:middle line:90%
We were all invited by Santilli.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:13.870 align:middle line:84%
One-- well, let's say that the
reason why he did this show

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:19.060 align:middle line:84%
in London was because he wanted
to sell the rights of this

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:19.860 align:middle line:90%
stuff--

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sure.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: --all over
the world, you know?

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
Kiviat, Bob Kiviat,

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.190 align:middle line:84%
was there as far
as the Americans

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:30.550 align:middle line:90%
with Fox, and many others.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:31.780 align:middle line:90%
Big brass from everywhere--

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So a lot of film
companies were represented

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.500 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Were there some
from Europe as well?

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.580 align:middle line:90%
Or was it all US film companies?

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: As far as European
that I know was Michael

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Hesemann and some Germans,
TV representatives.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:53.140 align:middle line:84%
The French guys were also
there, TF2, I believe.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And as far as the
Italians, Rai Due, Rai 2--

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:01.570 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important
Italian TV networks--

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:05.860 align:middle line:84%
was represented by
Giovanni Minoli.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was assisting
Giovanni Minoli

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:13.179 align:middle line:84%
in getting there, and also
Pinotti, as far as the other.

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this was a big
scene with a lot of people

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.750 align:middle line:84%
vying to be the first to
market with this film.

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:20.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, go ahead.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: He gave
to us a press kit,

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:33.550 align:middle line:84%
where it was very clearly stated
that that was the so-called

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Roswell footage.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.565 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Roswell?

00:34:36.565 --> 00:34:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: --footage.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.429 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Roswell footage, OK.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:42.219 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: --which I
believe is it is a very--

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:44.590 align:middle line:84%
it's a major mistake
because it wasn't

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:48.489 align:middle line:90%
Roswell at all, first of all.

00:34:48.489 --> 00:34:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And the story of
the Anvil Operation.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.880 align:middle line:84%
The Anvil Operation
was the story--

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.010 align:middle line:84%
was the operation, the
military operation,

00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:03.910 align:middle line:84%
the recovery operation in
which also, the cameraman

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:05.380 align:middle line:90%
was involved for filming.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:09.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, his business
was filming it.

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.680 align:middle line:90%
So we read that stuff.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And then lights down,
and then the projection

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:20.840 align:middle line:84%
of the second
autopsy, 18 minutes.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Technically, all different
as far as the incision,

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:25.910 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:29.630 align:middle line:84%
But also, the most
startling difference

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:34.280 align:middle line:84%
was that this body, the second
body, was heavily damaged.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.535 align:middle line:90%
It had a big wound on his right.

00:35:38.535 --> 00:35:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Big
gash on the thigh.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:40.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Yeah, big, big, big.

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:45.610 align:middle line:84%
The bones were
exposed, you know?

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:48.330 align:middle line:90%
And it was a bone there.

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Also, technically,
as I said before,

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:55.880 align:middle line:84%
the incision was performed with
a different, very different,

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.460 align:middle line:84%
technique, which
is currently still

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.580 align:middle line:90%
in use in the modern morgues--

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:04.580 align:middle line:90%
you know, in the--

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:08.690 align:middle line:84%
well, by the way, I went
to the Roman morgue.

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.060 align:middle line:90%
And I saw two autopsy.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And the first one
was performed exactly

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.078 align:middle line:90%
with the same technique.

00:36:15.078 --> 00:36:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now what was
the difference in the two

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.050 align:middle line:90%
techniques?

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Well, the second--

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:24.680 align:middle line:84%
the second one, it's
a Y incision, 1, 2, 3.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:30.140 align:middle line:84%
From here, from one
shoulder to the abdomen,

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:33.830 align:middle line:84%
the other shoulder down
here, and then go down

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:36.360 align:middle line:90%
to the lower abdomen.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Then, the reason
why they use this

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:44.810 align:middle line:84%
is to expose the rib
cage very quickly

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and then cut the rib cage,
you know, open the rib cage,

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:middle line:90%
and extract the organs.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is what happened
during the second autopsy.

00:36:56.330 --> 00:37:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Plus, there was the
sawing of the skull.

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The sawing
of the cranium.

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:03.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Yeah, exactly, but
not anything like they were

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:08.910 align:middle line:90%
doing in the other autopsy.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:09.710 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And I don't recall either if
the triangular bright object

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:19.580 align:middle line:84%
was extracted also in
the second autopsy.

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:20.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't recall it.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now it seems, from
looking at the alien autopsy

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:27.240 align:middle line:84%
film, which ended up being
the recreation of it,

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.990 align:middle line:84%
that the being may have
been gender neutral.

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:33.800 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't really tell
what sex it was per se?

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Yeah.

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:40.030 align:middle line:84%
The-- the little
opening was still there,

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:44.780 align:middle line:84%
so probably, this was either
a neutral or a puppet.

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:45.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that.

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: I definitely
don't know that.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
Santilli really had

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:56.150 align:middle line:84%
the chance of having the real
material, the good material,

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:59.810 align:middle line:84%
and then being
forced because the--

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:05.390 align:middle line:84%
being forced to reconstruct,
to rehearse everything--

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:10.070 align:middle line:84%
gave him the task to
rehearse to a director.

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And you know, and having
the second autopsy released,

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:20.607 align:middle line:84%
inserting some original
frames into the entire--

00:38:20.607 --> 00:38:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So what--

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.930 align:middle line:84%
I think what I'm
hearing, then, is he

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:26.960 align:middle line:84%
had fragments-- it's possible
that he had fragments

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.340 align:middle line:84%
of the original film and then
they built in the recreation

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:35.690 align:middle line:84%
films within it to create what
looked consistent with what

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:37.850 align:middle line:90%
the original film had?

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Exactly.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:43.100 align:middle line:84%
That's his point that
he maintains still now.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: He keeps--

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:49.550 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, he changed
his version many times.

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that it's
because he's delusional

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:55.130 align:middle line:90%
or a confused person, you know?

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Santilli is very,
very intelligent.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.560 align:middle line:84%
He made the deal of the
century, absolutely.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.930 align:middle line:90%
I tell you what, I don't--

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:10.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the exact figures,
but we are talking about tens

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.840 align:middle line:90%
of million dollars, you know?

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this is the
hottest thing out there.

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:16.063 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Yeah, OK.

00:39:16.063 --> 00:39:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I have a quote
from them which says, quote,

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:21.770 align:middle line:84%
"I maintain the original
film was real and as stated,

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:26.150 align:middle line:84%
we restored and recreated
elements of the film to give it

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:28.760 align:middle line:90%
the look of a cohesive autopsy."

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.560 align:middle line:90%
So that's what he says.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.530 align:middle line:84%
There's no one that can
really verify it besides him.

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:35.930 align:middle line:84%
He's the only one that had
access to the original.

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:38.750 align:middle line:84%
But the point is,
the film was then--

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:41.360 align:middle line:84%
this film was then
made as a recreation

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.330 align:middle line:84%
to show people what had
happened in that autopsy.

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:45.530 align:middle line:90%
What then happened?

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, first, let's take
a look at this little bit

remarkable film depicting

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.480 align:middle line:10%
the autopsy of a humanoid
life form was transmitted

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:14.040 align:middle line:10%
into the homes of millions of
television viewers worldwide.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.590 align:middle line:84%
The horrific but
compelling images

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:20.400 align:middle line:84%
started a heated

politically after this came

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:45.900 align:middle line:90%
out?

at Santilli and also the other

ufologists present, who attended
the showing at the London

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:13.950 align:middle line:90%
museum, were very disappointed.

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Because we were
expecting other images.

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:20.190 align:middle line:84%
We were expecting what
Santilli promised, like,

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:24.180 align:middle line:84%

the recovery team--

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:30.330 align:middle line:90%
not at all.

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:32.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, not even a frame of it.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:40.770 align:middle line:84%
So it also didn't
state anything at all.

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:43.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was
somewhere else now.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:46.050 align:middle line:90%
He was-- he was the magician.

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:50.160 align:middle line:84%

not Spyros Melaris,

back up a minute.

name our audience doesn't know.

talking about Santilli

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:02.880 align:middle line:84%
being the magician, A,
explain what that means.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.200 align:middle line:90%
And when you said not Spyro.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So please, go ahead and
explain what happened here.

>> BAIATA: The reason why I
mentioned Spyros Melaris is

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:12.330 align:middle line:84%
because this guy is
a great magician.

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:15.700 align:middle line:84%
He is very-- it's seemingly--
is very, very proficient, very

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.500 align:middle line:90%
good.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:22.200 align:middle line:84%
In creating special
effects, he contends

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:27.420 align:middle line:84%
that he is the director
of the second autopsy.

>> REGINA: The alien
autopsy we know, yeah.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Yeah, exactly, that
he shot in a flat out in, I

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:37.720 align:middle line:84%
believe, it's called
Camden in somewhere--

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, mm-hmm.

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: --somewhere there.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And that he uses
friends also his mom--

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:48.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know,
everybody was there--

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:51.030 align:middle line:90%
to shoot that material.

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And he gave the new footage,
the new videos, to Santilli.

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:00.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:04.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and he appeared
for about 10 years.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Then in 2006,
something happened.

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Santilli was interviewed
by a chap named--

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:16.590 align:middle line:84%
well, yeah, in a program,
in a British program

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:20.920 align:middle line:84%
called "Eamonn Investigates"
in Great Britain.

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.930 align:middle line:84%
He was interviewed and he
said for the first time,

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:29.460 align:middle line:84%
that that material was no
bueno, no good, all right?

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And that something
else happened,

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:36.330 align:middle line:84%
such as that he had to
recover what he could,

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:41.880 align:middle line:84%
and that the original frames
were inserted in other--

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:46.800 align:middle line:84%
in a movie that was shot
by some somebody else--

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:51.960 align:middle line:84%
that John Humphreys, creator
of special effects, very good

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.440 align:middle line:90%
creator of special effects--

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:59.220 align:middle line:84%
created the creature, the second
creature, that the bodies--

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:03.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the body, the body
was totally destroyed.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:09.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the puppet was
totally destroyed and buried

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:10.000 align:middle line:90%
somewhere in--

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where-- in
London, that all the guys who

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:17.940 align:middle line:84%
participated to the
shooting were, you know,

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:23.460 align:middle line:84%
intended not to word anything
at all out from their mouth,

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.110 align:middle line:84%
you know, for the
rest of their--

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they had all
declared kind of secrecy around

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:30.030 align:middle line:90%
working on this project, yeah?

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Exactly.

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:38.910 align:middle line:84%
By then, I believe that
the name of Spyros Melaris

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:44.100 align:middle line:84%
came out, because he was the
director of that shooting.

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA:
Unfortunately, until now,

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Spyros Melaris did
not kept his promise,

00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:02.520 align:middle line:84%
which was I will produce a
video in which I will show you

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:09.460 align:middle line:84%
everything that I had
done for this operation.

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.790 align:middle line:90%
I will write a book.

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:16.260 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
everything clearly

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and openly explained, how
I was involved and why.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:27.840 align:middle line:84%
In all these years, until
now, Santilli and Melaris

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:32.490 align:middle line:84%
are fighting each other,
but not legal fights,

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:34.770 align:middle line:90%
just verbal fight.

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So even this is a little fishy
to me, because money talks, OK?

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Now this guy made
a ton of money--

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.943 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Santilli?

00:45:44.943 --> 00:45:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: --yeah, Santilli.

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:49.140 align:middle line:84%
The other one did
everything and he

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:53.910 align:middle line:84%
didn't get even a penny
out of it, or very little.

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't know,
something is wrong.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Also, the others kept
their mouths shut.

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Even a certain Gareth, who
played the role of the guy

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:12.550 align:middle line:84%
with a mask on behind a
window, a glass window.

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:17.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, he was observing
from, you know, out

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.930 align:middle line:90%
of the dissection room.

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:21.060 align:middle line:90%
He was observing everything.

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Now getting to,
for instance, how

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:29.910 align:middle line:84%
can you reproduce exactly
all the instrument and specs

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:31.470 align:middle line:90%
of a situation like that?

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:35.100 align:middle line:84%
It takes you years
to get to have

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:43.812 align:middle line:84%
that phone with a curly wire
exactly there, or the watch--

00:46:43.812 --> 00:46:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Clock on the wall.

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: --clock on the wall,
all the surgical instruments

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:53.010 align:middle line:84%
exactly reproducing
the ones used by--

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:56.970 align:middle line:84%
all right, the Italians,
conducted by me,

00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:00.810 align:middle line:84%
were so stubborn in
research, for instance.

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:06.210 align:middle line:84%
To research the table, I mean,
the slab where the creature was

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:09.360 align:middle line:84%
lying, you know,
and dissected, none

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:16.500 align:middle line:90%
was able to find the table.

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So Maurizio, because
we could talk for hours about

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:23.250 align:middle line:84%
all of this part, the
in-fighting and accusations

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:26.760 align:middle line:84%
among people, where money
went, where money didn't go--

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.520 align:middle line:84%
ufologers who put other
ufologers work down.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.120 align:middle line:90%
And it goes on and on and on.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.940 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
shadowy figures here

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:35.280 align:middle line:84%
and there are a lot of really
wonderful figures here.

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:38.190 align:middle line:84%
In the end, when somebody
watches this film

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:41.400 align:middle line:84%
"Alien Autopsy," are
they seeing any kind

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:46.560 align:middle line:84%
of somewhat accurate
recreation of that second film,

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.180 align:middle line:90%
in your opinion?

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Yes, I think so.

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Because what is really important
to understand in this story

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:59.040 align:middle line:84%
is that nobody prior
to the Santilli footage

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.730 align:middle line:84%
ever came out with the
aliens, six fingers alien.

00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: This is major.

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:07.590 align:middle line:84%
This is very
important, you know.

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that
some of us came

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:18.840 align:middle line:84%
regarding this very peculiar
thing of the six fingers

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:24.570 align:middle line:84%
is because maybe in the
future, human beings

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:29.010 align:middle line:84%
will have more fingers
in their hands, you know?

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:30.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, maybe.

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Maybe.

00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is some
future iteration.

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Maybe.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:42.300 align:middle line:84%
But there is also one important
peculiar story to say,

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.850 align:middle line:90%
talk about briefly.

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:51.110 align:middle line:84%
In the year 2000 and
something, a movie came out.

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Santilli was involved
not in the production,

00:48:55.210 --> 00:49:00.030 align:middle line:84%
but somehow, he was involved
with this British company

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:01.907 align:middle line:90%
called Qwerty Films.

00:49:01.907 --> 00:49:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: How do you say?

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:05.390 align:middle line:90%
Q-U-E-R-T-Y?

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Q-W-E-R-T-Y, Qwerty.

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, like
a QWERTY keyboard.

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Qwerty films produced
this movie called "The Alien

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Autopsy."

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:23.740 align:middle line:84%
"The Alien Autopsy"
reconstructs, from scratch,

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:26.520 align:middle line:90%
everything regarding this story.

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:31.410 align:middle line:84%
The role of Santilli
and Shoefield

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:38.490 align:middle line:84%
are played by two comic
actors, British comic actors.

00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And the story goes
such as, we found

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.730 align:middle line:84%
that we have to go
to the United States

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:46.320 align:middle line:90%
in order to buy that material.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.610 align:middle line:90%
We go there.

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:54.570 align:middle line:84%
We see that stuff, and then
when we get back, the canisters,

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:56.280 align:middle line:90%
everything is gone--

00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:01.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, unfortunately,
wasn't usable anymore.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:07.230 align:middle line:84%
The cameraman saved one
canister, one last canister,

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:09.140 align:middle line:90%
containing 40--

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:10.200 align:middle line:90%
what was it?

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.830 align:middle line:84%
A minute and a half
of footage which--

00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:16.470 align:middle line:84%
black and white footage,
which is inserted

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:21.000 align:middle line:84%
in the end of the comic
movie called "Alien Autopsy"

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.610 align:middle line:84%
that went in theaters
all over, and that you

00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:30.270 align:middle line:84%
can buy in the video stores,
eventually buy, whatever.

00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:34.590 align:middle line:84%
This 40-- I mean this
minute and 1/2 images

00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:38.080 align:middle line:84%
in black and white
show many militarys

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:45.960 align:middle line:84%
surrounding a body lying on a
slab on the floor, open air.

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:50.070 align:middle line:90%
This scene is shot outside.

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And all these guys are going,
like, crazy around this body.

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:59.470 align:middle line:84%
You understand that the body
has six fingers because we,

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:03.160 align:middle line:84%
with Alberto, our
graphic director,

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:09.310 align:middle line:84%
were able to find that detail
of the six fingers is there.

00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:13.480 align:middle line:84%
But the images are just a
little blurred, you know?

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And a truck is arriving,
a military truck.

00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:25.540 align:middle line:84%
All these guys are wearing
either uniforms or other suits

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:30.040 align:middle line:90%
which you can put--

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:33.100 align:middle line:84%
you can say-- you can say
maybe these are, you know,

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:38.063 align:middle line:84%
people were there because they
had to be there in that moment.

00:51:38.063 --> 00:51:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --in a
professional capacity, yeah.

00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: Yeah.

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:42.405 align:middle line:84%
And the movie ends
like that, you know?

00:51:42.405 --> 00:51:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:46.210 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, it
was like a soft way

00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:48.040 align:middle line:84%
of getting the
original thing out

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.860 align:middle line:84%
without creating all the
stir within the UFO community

00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:52.420 align:middle line:90%
and all the infighting.

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: That's the reason,
because I asked Santilli

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:59.820 align:middle line:84%
if that footage was
the real footage.

00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:01.210 align:middle line:90%
And he said yes.

00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So I was working
with "Open Minds" TV.

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was the editor-in-chief
of "Open Minds Magazine"

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:13.270 align:middle line:84%
in the United States and
out in Phoenix, Arizona.

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:14.790 align:middle line:90%
So we called Santilli.

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:19.090 align:middle line:84%
John Rao, the boss, the
real boss of the bosses,

00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:21.790 align:middle line:90%
the boss of the company called.

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:24.760 align:middle line:90%
I gave Santilli to the phone--

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:27.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, on the
phone, to John Rao.

00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And they discussed the money,
the money side of this buying

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.440 align:middle line:90%
operation, of this deal.

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:40.660 align:middle line:84%
They didn't find a solution
because $25,000, according

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:42.550 align:middle line:90%
to Santilli, wasn't enough.

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sure.

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:45.460 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we have--

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:48.010 align:middle line:84%
we've written this down, Qwerty
films, "The Alien Autopsy"

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:49.000 align:middle line:90%
a British comedy.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.040 align:middle line:90%
OK, somewhere in the mid 2000s.

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:55.038 align:middle line:84%
So in summary, because we're
starting to run toward the end

00:52:55.038 --> 00:52:57.580 align:middle line:84%
of our conversation-- and I want
to ask a couple of questions

00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:58.510 align:middle line:90%
of Paola--

00:52:58.510 --> 00:53:01.180 align:middle line:84%
again, in piecing these
kinds of stories together,

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:03.370 align:middle line:84%
you're both researchers and
you're both journalists.

00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:06.820 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what you
shared about the first film

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:09.250 align:middle line:90%
that you saw is very moving.

00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And whether anyone ever
sees a frame of that or not,

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:14.020 align:middle line:90%
you witnessed that.

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:15.580 align:middle line:90%
That's your story.

00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:18.190 align:middle line:84%
You go through the rest of
your life with that experience.

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I accept that as
credible because you're

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:22.870 align:middle line:90%
a credible human being.

00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So anyone can do what
they wish with this.

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:27.450 align:middle line:84%
The second one is mired
in all kinds of stuff,

00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:31.330 align:middle line:84%
but let's just say it was
representative of the being,

00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:33.610 align:middle line:90%
of a being in another film.

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And now people can see little
tints of original footage

00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:40.180 align:middle line:84%
in this "Alien Autopsy"
British comedy if they wish.

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Let that stay in its
area of controversy.

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:45.610 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to piecing
these stories together,

00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:50.470 align:middle line:84%
because you do have such an odd
mixture of individuals with all

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:54.220 align:middle line:84%
these different agendas
for being in this field--

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:57.850 align:middle line:84%
some deliberately
for disinformation,

00:53:57.850 --> 00:54:01.810 align:middle line:84%
some deliberately as
professional skeptics,

00:54:01.810 --> 00:54:05.200 align:middle line:84%
some as almost delusional
trying to say everything's real.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.070 align:middle line:90%
It's all real.

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And then you have you
guys, you researchers,

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:10.740 align:middle line:84%
in there trying to
piece it all together.

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's when it
comes to the field work

00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:15.430 align:middle line:84%
that you do, and you have
done, such as the due diligence

00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:18.250 align:middle line:84%
in going to London and far
beyond, and that you do.

00:54:18.250 --> 00:54:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to get
to something with you

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:23.410 align:middle line:84%
on this, Paola, when it has
to do with the Roswell crash.

00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Because you actually went out
of your way, as you always do,

00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:28.300 align:middle line:90%
boots on the ground.

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:32.320 align:middle line:84%
You went and met with the-- just
to talk about the Roswell crash

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:36.270 align:middle line:84%
as a pixel of information to
complete this, the Roswell

00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:37.070 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:39.300 align:middle line:84%
You went and talked
with the mortician.

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: --with
Glenn Dennis, yes.

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Because in those days, I
was working for Maurizio

00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:44.110 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I came out of
Italy, and Glenn Dennis

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:49.180 align:middle line:84%
wasn't doing a whole
bunch of talking.

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:52.510 align:middle line:84%
He was in his
90's, and everybody

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:53.900 align:middle line:90%
was trying to reach him.

00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:57.340 align:middle line:84%
But I think the best
representation of Glenn Dennis

00:54:57.340 --> 00:55:00.910 align:middle line:84%
is in Paul David's movie,
you know, "Roswell."

00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:03.407 align:middle line:84%
Because what he
was asked to do--

00:55:03.407 --> 00:55:04.740 align:middle line:90%
and he told me this, personally.

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.698 align:middle line:84%
And when somebody tells
me something personally

00:55:06.698 --> 00:55:08.630 align:middle line:84%
that comes from
the source, that's

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:10.870 align:middle line:90%
when I really pay attention.

00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:14.230 align:middle line:84%
He told me that the
military had called him

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and that had asked for six
children's caskets, six

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:22.030 align:middle line:90%
children dead.

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Of course, these beings
are short and, you know,

00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:25.810 align:middle line:90%
small and everything.

00:55:25.810 --> 00:55:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And he asked the
logical question,

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.430 align:middle line:84%
where was the
automobile accident?

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:31.620 align:middle line:90%
Where's the accident?

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:34.420 align:middle line:90%
Because I want to go out there.

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And he was told, no, just have
them ready because, you know,

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:41.800 align:middle line:90%
we need them.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:46.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you watch the
several films on this,

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Glenn did go out to the field.

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:53.980 align:middle line:84%
He did have a friend who was
a nurse who sat with him.

00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And she said that it
was all, you know,

00:55:56.530 --> 00:55:57.980 align:middle line:90%
classified, top secret.

00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:00.910 align:middle line:84%
But as she was talking
to him, on a napkin,

00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:05.140 align:middle line:84%
she drew a picture
of a classic gray.

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:09.233 align:middle line:84%
And just-- she showed it to
him, and then she burned it.

00:56:09.233 --> 00:56:10.900 align:middle line:84%
I think there was a
candle or something.

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.240 align:middle line:90%
We've seen that image.

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: And Glenn,
like Walter Haut,

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:17.988 align:middle line:84%
who was the
information officer--

00:56:17.988 --> 00:56:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's
talk about Walter Haut.

00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:23.500 align:middle line:84%
When the crash occurred
in 1947 in New Mexico,

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:26.410 align:middle line:84%
he was the public
information officer

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:28.840 align:middle line:90%
at the time for the military?

00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:30.540 align:middle line:90%
For whom?

00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: For the military.

00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:33.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, for the military.

00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And he put out the
first newspaper

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:39.583 align:middle line:84%
which everybody buys right
now, that a flying saucer--

00:56:39.583 --> 00:56:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We can see
these guys together, OK,

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:42.870 align:middle line:90%
in this photo right here.

00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yeah.

00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, actually, these
men have passed on.

00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:48.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And Clifford Stone
is in the middle sitting down.

00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Stone, and then let
me give credit to Tom Carey

00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:53.917 align:middle line:84%
and Don Schmitt because
that's all they do.

00:56:53.917 --> 00:56:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're on the
right in the photo, dark hair.

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yeah, and they've
written all the books

00:56:58.030 --> 00:56:58.830 align:middle line:90%
on Roswell.

00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Because they-- as they say,
it's a race with the Undertaker.

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.540 align:middle line:84%
This happened so long ago, they
have to get all the witnesses.

00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:05.915 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --before
they all die.

00:57:05.915 --> 00:57:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So now Walter Haut, or Haut--
however you say his name,

00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:11.200 align:middle line:90%
H-A-U-T--

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.163 align:middle line:90%
you spoke with him.

00:57:12.163 --> 00:57:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: I spoke with him.

00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:14.950 align:middle line:84%
He was, at the
time-- you know, he's

00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:17.860 align:middle line:84%
the founder of the UFO
Museum with Julie Schuster.

00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:19.720 align:middle line:90%
They're both gone.

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he could
have come out with it.

00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:25.780 align:middle line:84%
But when he died, he
left a testament, a will,

00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:29.620 align:middle line:84%
to Don Schmitt that said he
physically saw the bodies.

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to
be in that hangar.

00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:33.670 align:middle line:84%
They open it up every
once in a while.

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was shown, in
the back room, what

00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:40.660 align:middle line:84%
looked like a kind of
a separate room that

00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:41.980 align:middle line:90%
had slabs on it, actually.

00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:44.350 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like
a refrigerated room

00:57:44.350 --> 00:57:46.930 align:middle line:84%
where they would have
had to refrigerate bodies

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:48.200 align:middle line:90%
in those days.

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And I was told that's
where the bodies were.

00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So Walter Haut left a death bed
testimony he had seen bodies.

00:57:56.860 --> 00:58:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because what happened
originally is he said Roswell

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.420 align:middle line:90%
crash had happened.

00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:04.317 align:middle line:84%
Then he very quickly was made
to retract the statement.

00:58:04.317 --> 00:58:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Then we got into the
weather balloon story--

00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:08.025 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Balloon, the
mogul, project mogul,

00:58:08.025 --> 00:58:09.650 align:middle line:90%
and everybody's hypothesis.

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:12.908 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: So I think what's
important to remember, Regina,

00:58:12.908 --> 00:58:17.050 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of the truth is
hidden in the disinformation

00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:18.130 align:middle line:90%
that comes out.

00:58:18.130 --> 00:58:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: So what needs
to happen with people is

00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:21.760 align:middle line:90%
discernment.

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.380 align:middle line:90%
How much of that story is true?

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And how much of it has
been contaminated, just

00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:28.720 align:middle line:90%
like this film footage?

00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's why I so
respect what you do, Maurizio,

00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and what do you do, Paola, to
be able to go and actually take

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:38.170 align:middle line:84%
the time to have firsthand
experience of these things,

00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:41.470 align:middle line:84%
to piece it together and get
away from the disinformation

00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:42.670 align:middle line:90%
stories on both sides.

00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Get away from the delusion
and look at it for what it is.

00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask you both this
question, then, wrapping up.

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:52.750 align:middle line:84%
What is the power in these
firsthand experiences

00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:56.870 align:middle line:84%
and messages in people
who have witnessed

00:58:56.870 --> 00:59:00.610 align:middle line:84%
firsthand accounts of beings
from other places being

00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:01.990 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth?

00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:03.070 align:middle line:90%
What is the most--

00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:05.620 align:middle line:84%
what is the most
profound aspect of this

00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:08.020 align:middle line:90%
in your mind first, Maurizio?

00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Well, my answer
is that since I was visited--

00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:18.060 align:middle line:84%
and that occurred
some years ago--

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:25.090 align:middle line:84%
1997 or 8, my life
changed totally.

00:59:25.090 --> 00:59:31.940 align:middle line:84%
I was convinced that
I had to go and keep

00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:38.370 align:middle line:84%
going all the time with my
work, just because people needed

00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:43.830 align:middle line:84%
to know that I won't say
the usual words like,

00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:45.840 align:middle line:90%
because we are not alone.

00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I would say that because
we have to understand

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:59.460 align:middle line:84%
that we have a role, that we
need to understand that when

00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:00.510 align:middle line:90%
they will arrive--

01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:04.990 align:middle line:84%
maybe, one day--
even if we will not

01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:12.130 align:middle line:84%
be ready as a human species,
some individuals will be ready.

01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:15.063 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty sure
they were not militarys.

01:00:15.063 --> 01:00:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They
were not military?

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: They
won't be military.

01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, they
won't be military.

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:20.003 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:00:20.003 --> 01:00:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: No, no, no, no.

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, because that's
based on fear and protection

01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and anxiety and xenophobia
and everything else.

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: But also,
because we were lied--

01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:31.655 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they kept the
secret for 70 years.

01:00:31.655 --> 01:00:32.455 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:00:32.455 --> 01:00:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, why?

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: I didn't get it.

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:40.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, until now, I don't have
a clue to answer to the reason

01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:42.215 align:middle line:90%
why they are keeping the secret.

01:00:42.215 --> 01:00:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
the biggest question.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.680 align:middle line:90%
Everybody asks, why the secrecy?

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:49.330 align:middle line:10%
>> BAIATA: Corso
would say because--

01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:57.440 align:middle line:10%
the reason is because they
can be dangerous to handle

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.440 align:middle line:10%
if you are not ready.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.420 align:middle line:84%
But now the point is,
ready in what sense?

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: I mean, as a
human being, like a normal,

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.460 align:middle line:90%
as a spiritual person?

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:16.390 align:middle line:90%
Or as a mechanical thinker?

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Or what else?

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:19.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.340 align:middle line:90%
I really don't know.

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:26.405 align:middle line:84%
I have to trust that this
will happen before I die.

01:01:26.405 --> 01:01:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You have the hope
that this will happen before

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:29.620 align:middle line:90%
you die?

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:31.990 align:middle line:84%
That someday, there
will be a presence here,

01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:33.370 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to freak out.

01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:35.637 align:middle line:84%
It'll be made known to
people who can handle it,

01:01:35.637 --> 01:01:36.720 align:middle line:90%
spiritually and otherwise.

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.137 align:middle line:84%
>> BAIATA: Nobody
was freaked out.

01:01:38.137 --> 01:01:39.160 align:middle line:90%
Nobody was freaked out.

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:40.493 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, I don't think so.

01:01:40.493 --> 01:01:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing
another interview also

01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:45.580 align:middle line:84%
with Paul Heinick, the
son of Alan Heinick, which

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:46.940 align:middle line:90%
we'll get into at another time.

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.960 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that
this disclosure is already

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:49.760 align:middle line:90%
happening.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.000 align:middle line:84%
History Channel's been doing
"Project Blue Book" now.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.490 align:middle line:84%
They're in their third season
of production, I think.

01:01:54.490 --> 01:01:55.720 align:middle line:90%
So it's happening.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.930 align:middle line:90%
It's already happening.

01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And in its own way,
the alien autopsy,

01:01:59.830 --> 01:02:03.760 align:middle line:84%
in spite of all the
controversy, contributed to what

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.680 align:middle line:90%
we can call a soft disclosure.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So with that, Maurizio,
I want to thank you

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:09.340 align:middle line:90%
so much for taking the time.

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:11.110 align:middle line:84%
It's very late in
Italy right now.

01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for taking
time with us today and sharing

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:16.640 align:middle line:90%
this really important story.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>> BAIATA: I thank you, Regina.

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:20.656 align:middle line:90%
Ciao, Paola, and ciao--

01:02:20.656 --> 01:02:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Ciao.

01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Paola, that was a
wonderful answer from Maurizio.

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And now I want to
know your take on it.

01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:29.080 align:middle line:84%
You have invested more
than half your life,

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.270 align:middle line:90%
I think, researching this now.

01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And you've done it-- you've
gone through your own phases

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:35.380 align:middle line:84%
of growth and learning
along the way.

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
But you've always
insisted on one thing.

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:38.230 align:middle line:90%
You want firsthand accounts.

01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:40.360 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to hear
other people's hearsay

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and just read other
people's books, which

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.930 align:middle line:90%
I respect immensely.

01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
So what does all this
mean in the larger

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.655 align:middle line:84%
context for humanity, as
far as you're concerned?

01:02:48.655 --> 01:02:50.780 align:middle line:10%
>> HARRIS: Well, first of
all, on a personal level,

01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:53.590 align:middle line:10%
I think I was destined to do
this because this isn't normal

01:02:53.590 --> 01:02:54.460 align:middle line:10%
work.

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:56.860 align:middle line:10%
So I was destined to do
this, meeting Heinick,

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:58.690 align:middle line:10%
working with Maurizio.

01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:00.580 align:middle line:10%
And I think that
this is probably

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:03.010 align:middle line:10%
the most important
question for humanity.

01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:05.420 align:middle line:90%
I will say, we are not alone.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:08.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean,
he alluded to that.

01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:12.010 align:middle line:84%
It means a lot on a
psychological level,

01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:15.610 align:middle line:84%
on an institutional level--
maybe our institutions need

01:03:15.610 --> 01:03:16.750 align:middle line:90%
to change--

01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:22.330 align:middle line:84%
on an educational level, that we
are part of something greater,

01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:25.600 align:middle line:84%
that humanity is part of
something much greater.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And then, like Maurizio, I've
had my own contact situation

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.100 align:middle line:84%
which opens up a
whole spiritual level.

01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And it makes us relook
at consciousness

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:41.650 align:middle line:84%
as maybe the motivating
factor for everything we do,

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:43.523 align:middle line:84%
and certainly, for
everything I do.

01:03:43.523 --> 01:03:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, Paola, again, thank
you for your many years

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.400 align:middle line:90%
of hard work.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And so until we see you here on
set with us again, thank you.
