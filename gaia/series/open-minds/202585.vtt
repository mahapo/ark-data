>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Our global economy

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.930 align:middle line:10%
is entering what
Darryl Schoon calls

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.520 align:middle line:10%
the "Time of the Vulture."

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.353 align:middle line:10%
What does this mean?

00:00:25.353 --> 00:00:27.770 align:middle line:10%
Well, we'll go to the man who
has known his share of trial

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.100 align:middle line:10%
by fire and has written a
number of books, including

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.870 align:middle line:10%
the "Time of the
Vulture," a book that

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.280 align:middle line:10%
takes a look at the future
of money and the economy

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.487 align:middle line:10%
and so much more.

00:00:35.487 --> 00:00:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Darryl, I don't even know
where to begin with you.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.600 align:middle line:84%
For those who have not already
met you, you're in for a treat.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.150 align:middle line:84%
You're in for the
wildest ride ever.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.620 align:middle line:90%
What a life you've had.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And so before we go, I just
want to tell people what we're

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.625 align:middle line:90%
going to do here today, OK.

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DARRYL SCHOON: OK.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What we're
going to attempt to do.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: OK

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, we're
going to get to know you.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: OK.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you're
probably the greatest character

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.740 align:middle line:90%
I've ever met.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.290 align:middle line:90%
And you've had a crazy life.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.560 align:middle line:90%
And you also are very brilliant.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.900 align:middle line:84%
You were a very high
achiever when you're young.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And this continues in
your intellectual view

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.880 align:middle line:84%
of life and pursuits and
also connecting the dots.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.870 align:middle line:90%
You're a really good--

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.550 align:middle line:84%
another man I love
is Danny Sheehan.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.800 align:middle line:84%
You're really good dot
connector like that.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And you've connected
dots about the economy

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.190 align:middle line:84%
that I think are
critical for people

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.390 align:middle line:84%
to understand right now because
we're in trouble, OK, globally.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And then I want us to
go into an area that

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.250 align:middle line:90%
goes back to who we are.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Because you've learned
who you are, OK?

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is what really matters
after all of it, so start.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.640 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHOON: You know, Regina,
I love the fact that you're

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.350 align:middle line:10%
going to frame it this way.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.020 align:middle line:10%
Because far before
I even started

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.118 align:middle line:10%
thinking about economics,
because I never

00:01:43.118 --> 00:01:44.410 align:middle line:10%
took an Econ course in my life.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.720 align:middle line:10%
And yet here we are, you
asked me to come here.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:84%
You ask me to
speak on economics.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's what my
reputation is, all right,

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:90%
in a certain way.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.625 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: That reputation--

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
part of your reputation.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Because
in 2007, I wrote

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.390 align:middle line:84%
a book called "Time
of the Vulture"

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:84%
in which I predicted a
severe economic collapse.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And I presented it at a group
called the Positive Deviant

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Network by my friend
from law school,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:84%
who had brought together
a group of what he called,

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:84%
high achieving,
out-of-the-box thinkers.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Dues were $7,500 a year.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.950 align:middle line:90%
We met four times a year.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
different subjects.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, in March 2007, I
presented a 148 page paper

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.920 align:middle line:84%
to this group predicting a
severe economic collapse.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And with people
who could afford that kind

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:90%
of money, they didn't like it.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, of course not.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And it didn't look
like anything was going wrong.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, a year and a half
later, in September 2008,

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.330 align:middle line:84%
the, what we call the
financial crisis happened.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing
in the year 2020

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.780 align:middle line:84%
is the resolution
of that crisis.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And we haven't
reached there yet.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have
not reached it.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to--
we need to look at it.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Everyone needs to kind
of take the blinders off

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.070 align:middle line:84%
right now, because there's
more to life than just

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.853 align:middle line:84%
whatever our financial profile
is or is not going to be.

00:02:59.853 --> 00:03:01.520 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, let's
get into your life.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.728 align:middle line:90%
I want to jump right into it.

00:03:02.728 --> 00:03:04.340 align:middle line:84%
First of all,
everyone thinks, wow,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:84%
what a cool Native
American dude.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.840 align:middle line:90%
And so I said, what is your--

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:90%
and you said, I'm Chinese.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.948 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: I'm
Chinese, that's right.

00:03:10.948 --> 00:03:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everywhere
you go, everyone

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.442 align:middle line:90%
thinks you're Native American.

00:03:13.442 --> 00:03:14.984 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Everyone
thinks I'm Native.

00:03:14.984 --> 00:03:16.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's an honor, all right.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:90%
But in fact, people used to--

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Indians used to, you
know, give me that look.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And I would never return
it, because it was so--

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.340 align:middle line:84%
their path has
been so difficult.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Lately.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Before it was, they
lived in a land that was--

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Plentiful.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.003 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Plentiful.

00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:34.460 align:middle line:84%
They talked to the
spirit, the great spirit.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.010 align:middle line:90%
Then all hell broke loose.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your
family came from China.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: China, yes.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you
were taught to be--

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.842 align:middle line:84%
you were supposed to be a high
achieving, professional man.

00:03:42.842 --> 00:03:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Yeah, go
ahead and do it.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.400 align:middle line:90%
So I was on my way.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.360 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.770 align:middle line:84%
In 1966, I was Hastings College
of the Law in San Francisco.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes,
my ex went there.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:84%
I used to do research in
the Law library there.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Really?

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, OK, cool.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Because we have so many
connections we found already.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: 10 years ago,
I wrote to the library,

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.080 align:middle line:84%
head archivist at Hastings,
because there was a newspaper

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:84%
there, I thought, that still
may be in their archives.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.820 align:middle line:84%
But it was never distributed
when I was there.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Because 1966, my
friend Marshall,

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.210 align:middle line:84%
who had that meeting in 2000--
you know, 30, 40 years later,

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.720 align:middle line:84%
was editor of their
newspaper, "Voir Dire," OK?

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me to
write an article.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.570 align:middle line:90%
We were both freshmen.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.500 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't want to.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Marshall wanted to
change the world.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I was already at
war with the world.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.910 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want--

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.452 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
a social activist.

00:04:35.452 --> 00:04:36.550 align:middle line:90%

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: I was angry.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: The war was going on.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.760 align:middle line:84%
They wanted us to
fight their war.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.542 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: I already
knew about power.

00:04:41.542 --> 00:04:43.180 align:middle line:90%
I majored in political science.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.487 align:middle line:84%
I was reading power
politics in high school.

00:04:45.487 --> 00:04:46.570 align:middle line:90%
I knew John Foster Dulles.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.140 align:middle line:90%
I knew the--

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The whole story.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: I knew more
than I wanted to know.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: And I was bailing.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Bailing In 1966.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So Marshall wants me
to write an article.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.300 align:middle line:90%
I refused to do it.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.440 align:middle line:90%
So I write an article.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.710 align:middle line:84%
He puts it on the front page of
Hastings Law School newspaper,

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:90%
front page.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.890 align:middle line:90%
Church liable for acts of God.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.397 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:05:07.397 --> 00:05:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: All right?

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.117 align:middle line:84%
Now in law-- common law, no
one's liable for an act of God.

00:05:12.117 --> 00:05:12.917 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:12.917 --> 00:05:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: It's an act of
God so earthquake, tsunami,

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.500 align:middle line:90%
it's a force--

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right-o.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And I
wrote, the church

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.270 align:middle line:90%
is liable for acts of God.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And my thinking was
this, all right--

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.900 align:middle line:84%

that God would not

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.330 align:middle line:90%
allow an injustice in his name.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.060 align:middle line:84%
He allows many
injustices, as we know,

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.280 align:middle line:84%
because it's part of
our learning process.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.990 align:middle line:84%
We have free will,
that's how we learn,

by mistakes and not mistakes.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.830 align:middle line:84%
But when his name is
used, my reasoning

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.120 align:middle line:90%
was, he doesn't like it.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.070 align:middle line:84%
So when we say an act
of God, that God's--

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.440 align:middle line:84%
no one's liable, he
took umbrage with that.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.012 align:middle line:84%
I said, so there
must be a solution.

00:05:53.012 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:90%
But we haven't seen it.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, there
are those among us,

advantages to, of great wealth.

happens and you have damages,

00:06:02.012 --> 00:06:04.220 align:middle line:84%
you should just go to your

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Because
I read it, go wow,

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.520 align:middle line:84%
this is where it came from,
word for word, basically.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So "The Lazy
Man's Guide to Riches."

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Guide to
Riches-- so Marsh,

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.600 align:middle line:84%
said you write down the
list of what you want.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:12.913 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: All right?

00:10:12.913 --> 00:10:14.765 align:middle line:84%
And then you put--
you make sure there's

00:10:14.765 --> 00:10:17.390 align:middle line:84%
no conflicts on your list, what
you want-- your emergency right

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:18.320 align:middle line:90%
now, car fixed.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: The next list
is, how you want your life

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.950 align:middle line:90%
to be in its ultimate sense.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:23.143 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: All right?

00:10:23.143 --> 00:10:24.685 align:middle line:84%
The third list is
how you want to be.

00:10:24.685 --> 00:10:25.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:25.485 --> 00:10:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: All right, you
want to be easier going,

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.308 align:middle line:84%
or more focused,
have more energy.

00:10:29.308 --> 00:10:30.600 align:middle line:90%
So you write these three lists.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Then you go through
your lists, make

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.240 align:middle line:84%
sure there's no conflicts,
and then Josie-- who's

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.040 align:middle line:90%
a used car dealer.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.830 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't
understand why this works.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:37.790 align:middle line:90%
He said, but I'm a millionaire.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.170 align:middle line:84%
I was flat broke
before I used it.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And somebody gave me
this piece of paper.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm a millionaire.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is why-- and I
believe it's because of this.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.650 align:middle line:84%
He said, I made that
money in direct mail.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:46.820 align:middle line:90%
You know, but this is it.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.620 align:middle line:90%
So Marshall had his list.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.790 align:middle line:90%
I had my list.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:90%
We don't see each other's list.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.220 align:middle line:90%
Every morning, I read my list.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.020 align:middle line:90%
And it hit me--

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.143 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What were you
aspiring to at that time?

00:10:56.143 --> 00:10:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Not to work.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so money
without working, kind of.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Yeah.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You needed but
you didn't want to work.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:02.005 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Yeah,
yeah, and I mean,

00:11:02.005 --> 00:11:04.005 align:middle line:84%
the hippy didn't give
a care about money.

00:11:04.005 --> 00:11:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Hippies really
don't care about money.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just
needed a pad though.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Oh, I did,
because I was flat broke.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: All right,
so I got my list.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Marshall's doing his list.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Every morning and every
night I have the 3x5 cards.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was, I
am retired by the time--

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm retired.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I noticed, I sit there, I say
it, retired by the time I'm 30.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:25.867 align:middle line:84%
And I imagined not
working, partly

00:11:25.867 --> 00:11:27.950 align:middle line:84%
because my father, he's a
Capricorn, he's Chinese,

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.390 align:middle line:90%
always going to work.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.520 align:middle line:90%
And I was just pushed--

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:30.620 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The work ethic.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: --early age to
work, work, work, work, work.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.287 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you
know what, life

00:11:34.287 --> 00:11:36.530 align:middle line:84%
would be great if he wasn't
trying to make me work.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Life is fun-- could be fun.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.720 align:middle line:90%
So I'm doing that.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And imagined it, along
with my other things.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.430 align:middle line:90%
We're here, you know.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Three years later, Marshall is
living next to Dianne Feinstein

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:84%
in Presidio Heights in San
Francisco in a mansion,

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Rolls-Royce, Corvette.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm living on Union Street
with a little Karmann Ghia,

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.335 align:middle line:90%
with a whole lot of cash.

00:11:59.335 --> 00:12:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, how did
you get all that cash?

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Drug dealing.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.118 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: It just came.

00:12:03.118 --> 00:12:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But did you keep
drug dealing psychedelics,

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.630 align:middle line:90%
or a little bit of everything?

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Yes, well--

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mostly psychedelics.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: I don't like to--

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.352 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
you don't need to.

00:12:11.352 --> 00:12:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: That's then.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mostly psychedelics,
that was your thing.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: That was then.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: That was then.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.305 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:14.305 --> 00:12:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: That was then.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, then.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.703 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: And it happened.

00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:17.640 align:middle line:90%
It was just huge, OK.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And when you do
affirmations, you don't say,

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.580 align:middle line:84%
I want to do-- you don't put
down how you want it to happen.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It just
starts happening.

00:12:23.495 --> 00:12:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: It's happening.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.385 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So these
opportunities came to you?

00:12:25.385 --> 00:12:26.302 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Come to you.

00:12:26.302 --> 00:12:27.200 align:middle line:90%
Oh, just incredible.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now,
let's stop a minute.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you're raised in
this very traditional way.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Yeah.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you have any kind
of internal kind of dissonance

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:35.930 align:middle line:90%
with the notion.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Or was it just supplying
what you needed,

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:42.020 align:middle line:84%
so that works, in
terms of selling drugs,

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.820 align:middle line:84%
and what your parents'
expectations were,

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.950 align:middle line:84%
and all that conditioning
and programming?

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: The Haight Ashbury
was an outlaw society.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it was.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: I mean, you went
to jail for smoking pot.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.118 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it was.

00:12:53.118 --> 00:12:54.701 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: People got
life for a joint.

00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:55.501 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:12:55.501 --> 00:12:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: So whatever you did--

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:00.710 align:middle line:84%
whatever you did, we knew
what being an outlaw was.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.000 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't matter.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the first riot I
was it was on Haight Street.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:05.630 align:middle line:90%
And I was sitting there.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:06.710 align:middle line:84%
I owned a house
on Haight Street.

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:07.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting there.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.570 align:middle line:90%
It's 1967.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:09.930 align:middle line:90%
I see the cops comes from one--

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.730 align:middle line:90%
I look around.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:11.990 align:middle line:90%
They're coming from both ways.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And they're beating
us with batons--

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.830 align:middle line:90%
hippies!

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.413 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't a political
demonstration.

00:13:17.413 --> 00:13:18.560 align:middle line:90%
Hippies weren't political.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.153 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: They just beat--

00:13:20.153 --> 00:13:21.980 align:middle line:90%
I saw them beating women.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I jumped in my car.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.270 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't even get
back to my house.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.650 align:middle line:90%
So we knew about the cops.

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:28.520 align:middle line:90%
We know about law.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.630 align:middle line:90%
We knew about order.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Whose law, whose
order, is my saying.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and
you were already--

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: A political radical.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A radical,
right, exactly.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.888 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: So what
happens is that.

00:13:37.888 --> 00:13:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And by the way,
this was pretty common.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.750 align:middle line:84%
This was common at Lake Tahoe,
San Francisco, Mill Valley--

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Oh, it was everywhere.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone was dealing
drugs of one kind or another.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.942 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: My wife made
the remark, when I finally

00:13:46.942 --> 00:13:49.520 align:middle line:84%
went to jail, she said, free
the Marin County three million.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:51.262 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:51.262 --> 00:13:52.220 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was doing it.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Everybody.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:53.920 align:middle line:90%
It was our culture.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.400 align:middle line:84%
It was our
subculture, all right.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.660 align:middle line:90%
So I can look--

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.740 align:middle line:90%
it was what we did.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: It was what we did.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:84%
So you're on Union Street,
Karmann Ghia, loads of cash.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Loads of
cash, all right.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
what happened?

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: And so there I am.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not only that--
am I on Union Street--

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.390 align:middle line:90%
I've got a business with China.

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:12.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm going in and out of China.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm on Dianne Feinstein's
China committee.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:84%
I've got presidential
invitations

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:84%
to Deng Xiaoping when
he came United States.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.280 align:middle line:84%
That year, I flew back to
talk to McDonnell Douglas

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.900 align:middle line:84%
on an offset program with
rugs and Chinese goods.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.740 align:middle line:90%
So I was happening.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And I'm
on the front page.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were a bona
fide businessman now.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Oh, I'm on the front
page of the "San Francisco

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Chronicle" business section with
my rugs in the foreign trade

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.100 align:middle line:90%
zone.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.020 align:middle line:90%
So you were enterprising.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:37.820 align:middle line:90%
You were open.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:38.820 align:middle line:90%
You were audacious.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:90%
You had courage.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And things
were happening.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And things
were happening.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.350 align:middle line:90%
And luck was coming to you.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Your affirmations were
really working for you.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Now, this
is what happens.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting in my
house in San Francisco,

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.070 align:middle line:84%
by myself in my
nice little flat.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.200 align:middle line:84%
I have everything that
people thought if they had,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.000 align:middle line:90%
they'd be happy.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.060 align:middle line:90%
I was married.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.812 align:middle line:90%
I had two wonderful kids.

00:14:57.812 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I
had to think about

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.530 align:middle line:90%
was where are we going to eat?

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:90%
Vanessi's, which is a nice--

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:03.262 align:middle line:90%
I remember Vanessi's.

00:15:03.262 --> 00:15:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: You knew Dragomir.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: He was the--

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even Perry's
on Union Street.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Yeah, Perry's, OK.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.540 align:middle line:90%
So there we were.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:10.340 align:middle line:90%
Life is good.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.310 align:middle line:90%
And I'm in my flat, Regina.

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.370 align:middle line:90%
And I hear these words.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.380 align:middle line:90%
I hear words.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.585 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: This isn't it.

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON:
[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] This--

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how did
you feel about that?

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Not good, because I
thought it meant I had to give

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:90%
all this money--

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:28.995 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everything up.

00:15:28.995 --> 00:15:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: If this
isn't it, what is?

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.120 align:middle line:84%
So Marsh and I had been
taking a seminar where you ask

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.440 align:middle line:90%
Knowing, which is basic Source.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Marsha's your wife.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:35.865 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Martha-- no, this is--

00:15:35.865 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
Marshall, not Martha.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:37.542 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Martha is my wife.

00:15:37.542 --> 00:15:38.730 align:middle line:84%
But Marsh is my friend
from law school.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, got you.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: So we
were taking this.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:40.980 align:middle line:84%
He was the one who gave
me all these books.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:41.938 align:middle line:90%
So we're sitting there.

00:15:41.938 --> 00:15:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And in the Knowing seminar,
you close your eyes.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And you ask Knowing,
which is God.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:48.970 align:middle line:90%
I now-- or universe.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:49.770 align:middle line:90%
You don't think.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:50.130 align:middle line:90%
You sit.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:51.090 align:middle line:90%
And you ask a question.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.588 align:middle line:90%
And you wait for the answer.

00:15:53.588 --> 00:15:54.630 align:middle line:90%
You don't think about it.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.040 align:middle line:90%
You wait.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.960 align:middle line:90%
So I close my eyes.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do I want?

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:90%
If this isn't it, what is it?

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And this feeling of peace
that was so deep just--

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:07.410 align:middle line:90%
I could feel it.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.380 align:middle line:84%
It was like I was on the
side of a mountain at night.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear the crickets
going [IMITATES CRICKETS]..

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side of the
mountain, there was a cabin.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.520 align:middle line:90%
And there was a fireplace in it.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Its fire was burning brightly.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.180 align:middle line:90%
And I knew that was my house.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:90%
And I knew I wasn't in it.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.060 align:middle line:90%
But I felt at home.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.561 align:middle line:90%
I felt-- and I go, wow.

00:16:29.561 --> 00:16:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Quiet.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.408 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Quiet.

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:32.700 align:middle line:90%
Now, let me tell you something.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You had a noisy life.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Even
without drug dealing,

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:36.780 align:middle line:90%
life tends to be noisy.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, that's
what I'm saying.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.635 align:middle line:90%
You had a noisy life, yeah.

00:16:38.635 --> 00:16:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Fake names, shopping
bags full of cash-- hundreds,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.020 align:middle line:90%
rubber bands--

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.100 align:middle line:90%
private planes sometimes.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean, OK.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Phones
ringing, all right--

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:90%
peace, wow.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, if those
cards have got me all this,

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.350 align:middle line:90%
maybe they'll get me peace.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:01.470 align:middle line:90%
So I write down--

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.099 align:middle line:84%
I stole something from
"Jonathan Livingston Seagull."

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:05.599 align:middle line:90%
I remember it was so audacious.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:08.310 align:middle line:84%
When I wrote it down, I said,
I am everywhere at once.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.080 align:middle line:90%
How in the hell can that be?

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, I wrote it down.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm at peace.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And so every morning, I'm
doing my affirmations.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:15.730 align:middle line:90%
And I've got one.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.839 align:middle line:84%
And so I imagine
myself at peace, just

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.970 align:middle line:90%
like I do with all of them, OK?

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.128 align:middle line:84%
Three months later,
I'm at Marshall's.

00:17:22.128 --> 00:17:24.170 align:middle line:84%
He had this real estate
company in San Francisco.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:25.170 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't doing anything.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.690 align:middle line:84%
So I used to go
down and kill time,

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:30.230 align:middle line:84%
because they used to--
his office meeting.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And this one day, this
couple walked in--

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:37.220 align:middle line:90%
Mary Payne and Jim Hickman.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:41.100 align:middle line:90%
And they said, we have a book.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.930 align:middle line:84%
We know you're working
with affirmations.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to use an
affirmation today called,

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.313 align:middle line:90%
I am entitled to miracles.

00:17:48.313 --> 00:17:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've been
doing affirmations.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: That
was another level.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.530 align:middle line:90%
I am entitled to miracles.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:56.480 align:middle line:90%
That never even occurred to me--

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.965 align:middle line:90%
never occurred to me.

00:17:57.965 --> 00:17:58.840 align:middle line:90%
So I went up to them.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.040 align:middle line:84%
I said, where did
this come from?

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And they said, the book
just got published.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.472 align:middle line:90%
And they opened it up.

00:18:04.472 --> 00:18:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
the foreword said.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.388 align:middle line:10%
It's called "A
Course in Miracles."

00:18:07.388 --> 00:18:08.547 align:middle line:10%
And the foreword said this.

00:18:08.547 --> 00:18:10.880 align:middle line:10%
Now, you've got to realize I
had been doing affirmations

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.720 align:middle line:10%
for peace for about
three or four months.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.860 align:middle line:90%
This is the foreword.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.100 align:middle line:90%
This is a manual for peace--

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.000 align:middle line:90%
first words.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: It is a
required course.

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Only the time you
take it is up to you.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Free will does not mean you
establish the curriculum.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.810 align:middle line:84%
It merely means you choose
what to take at a given time.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.420 align:middle line:84%
This course does
not aim at teaching

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:84%
the meaning of love, for that
is beyond what can be taught.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.140 align:middle line:84%
It does aim, however,
at removing your blocks

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.840 align:middle line:84%
to your awareness of
love's presence, which

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:90%
is your natural inheritance.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.920 align:middle line:90%
The opposite of love is fear.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.960 align:middle line:84%
However, that which
is all-encompassing

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.850 align:middle line:90%
has no opposite.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:49.920 align:middle line:90%
Herein lies the peace of God.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.080 align:middle line:84%
That which is real can
never be threatened.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.834 align:middle line:84%
And that which is
unreal does not exist.

00:18:54.834 --> 00:18:56.762 align:middle line:90%
(WHISPERS) Wow.

00:18:56.762 --> 00:18:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
going to get back

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.950 align:middle line:84%
to the-- at the end
of this conversation--

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.848 align:middle line:84%
that which is real can
never be threatened.

00:19:01.848 --> 00:19:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: So I go buy the book.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And they
have a lesson a day.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:08.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing this lesson
a day by myself, OK?

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:90%
And then I get to a lesson--

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:14.490 align:middle line:84%
changed my life,
because I misread it.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:15.365 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:15.365 --> 00:19:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: But I
think my life was

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.907 align:middle line:90%
supposed to happen this way.

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: The lesson
said, why do you

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.820 align:middle line:90%
want things a certain way?

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And it said, because you had
certain experiences you've

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.410 align:middle line:84%
enjoyed and certain experiences
that have been unpleasant.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.030 align:middle line:84%
The truth is you
are in no position

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.800 align:middle line:84%
to determine what's
good or bad for you.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things that
you've enjoyed the most

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.620 align:middle line:90%
have retarded your progress.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And other things that have
been the most painful,

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.790 align:middle line:90%
you've learned the most from.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:42.670 align:middle line:84%
You have a belief that
unless you're in control,

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.470 align:middle line:90%
life is chaos.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:50.380 align:middle line:84%
The truth is if you could but
turn tomorrow over to he who

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:54.250 align:middle line:84%
wants your happiness-- for
it is his happiness also--

00:19:54.250 --> 00:20:00.270 align:middle line:84%
every moment would become an
encounter with the eternal.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And I read, every moment an
encounter with the eternal.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With the eternal.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Wow.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:13.036 align:middle line:84%
Every moment an encounter
with the eternal--

00:20:13.036 --> 00:20:14.950 align:middle line:90%
what do I have to do?

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.230 align:middle line:90%
I have to turn it over.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, man, turn it over--

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.070 align:middle line:90%
that means, let go.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Oh, man, what is my
control mechanism?

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.764 align:middle line:90%
Affirmations.

00:20:26.764 --> 00:20:28.510 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have everything I
want except every moment being

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:32.748 align:middle line:90%
an encounter with the eternal.

00:20:32.748 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And this peace.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And this--
that's what I wanted.

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: So I stopped
every one of my affirmations

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and just did the "Course
in Miracles" affirmations.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Years later, I
looked back on it.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.540 align:middle line:84%
A careful reading of
what it said was this.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:54.910 align:middle line:84%
A more careful reading
of that verse said this--

00:20:54.910 --> 00:21:00.020 align:middle line:84%
if you could but
turn tomorrow over.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:00.932 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:00.932 --> 00:21:02.265 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: It didn't say I could.

00:21:02.265 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could-- it
said, if you could but.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.120 align:middle line:90%
OK, got you-- difference.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: If you could but.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.740 align:middle line:90%
Now, in my defense, I'm 32.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Many great things
have happened to me.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've gone--
my life, Regina, is

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.270 align:middle line:90%
like a comic book or a novel.

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So who knows what
can or can't happen?

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.302 align:middle line:90%
So I think, anything can happen.

00:21:23.302 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh, if I let go, it'll happen.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:29.960 align:middle line:84%
I blew past the words,
if you could but.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:84%
"The Course in Miracles"
even talks about surrender.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And it goes back later
and says, you can't surrender.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.575 align:middle line:90%
You're too afraid.

00:21:38.575 --> 00:21:40.028 align:middle line:90%
You're too scared.

00:21:40.028 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:90%
You're hanging on, like--

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
in human nature.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: It's not
in human nature.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And it
said, God would not

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.450 align:middle line:90%
ask of you what you can't do.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:52.440 align:middle line:84%
God would only ask of
you what you could do.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.960 align:middle line:84%
If you are willing
to surrender, God

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.680 align:middle line:84%
will take this gift from
you and transform it.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so--

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: I let go.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:03.500 align:middle line:90%
I lost every penny I had made.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.958 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was
going to say, yeah,

00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and at what point did you
actually surrender [LAUGHS]

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.742 align:middle line:90%
or not on the other one.

00:22:09.742 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: I'm still doing it.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:12.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm still--

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, OK.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.218 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: The pieces
are out there.

00:22:15.218 --> 00:22:16.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not one process.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: People
think that if you

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.410 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge Jesus Christ your
lord and savior, you're there.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:21.158 align:middle line:90%
You want to be there.

00:22:21.158 --> 00:22:22.950 align:middle line:84%
People say, if you
surrender, you're there.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:23.750 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:24.840 align:middle line:90%
You want to surrender.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.820 align:middle line:90%
People say if you, "I am--" No.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:27.960 align:middle line:90%
You want to.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.480 align:middle line:90%
And that intent is powerful.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.310 align:middle line:90%
That intent will set your path.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:36.240 align:middle line:84%
But it-- but your intent by
itself does not make it so.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:39.960 align:middle line:90%
OK, so now, you lose everything.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.933 align:middle line:84%
When did you end
up in prison again?

00:22:41.933 --> 00:22:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Oh, well,
what happened?

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What happened?

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Because I'll just say,
the other surrender--

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:46.740 align:middle line:90%
double entendre, there.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: The double
surrender is that I let go.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.020 align:middle line:90%
I lost everything.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.857 align:middle line:84%
And then through another series
of books, I started to have--

00:22:54.857 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:90%
because it was all--

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.130 align:middle line:84%
I said, I found a book
on how to do all things.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:90%
It was a channeled book on--

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.880 align:middle line:84%
it says, you, of
yourself, can do nothing.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Everything happens
because of who you are.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.240 align:middle line:90%
Spirit does it all.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.190 align:middle line:84%
By your intention,
spirit happens.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:09.570 align:middle line:90%
So by declaration, affir--

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.340 align:middle line:90%
I go, oh, this is it.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.447 align:middle line:90%
I can do affirmations again.

00:23:13.447 --> 00:23:15.030 align:middle line:84%
So I started doing
affirmations again.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They worked
for you before.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.958 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: I'm in Rome at
the Hassler Hotel in a suite

00:23:17.958 --> 00:23:18.980 align:middle line:90%
one year later.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:19.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Life is good.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:84%
That's when I was
living in Mill Valley.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.020 align:middle line:90%
Life is good.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:22.978 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Life is good.

00:23:22.978 --> 00:23:24.450 align:middle line:90%
You were living it large, too.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And then
I read another book.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And it says, your use
of thought to create

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:34.870 align:middle line:84%
your reality is inappropriate
use of this power at this time.

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Because at this time,
much of what you learn

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.160 align:middle line:90%
comes through adversity.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And you are using this power
to keep away these learning

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.691 align:middle line:90%
situations that you need.

00:23:45.691 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-oh.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.130 align:middle line:90%
Bum, bum, bum bum.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:50.040 align:middle line:90%
What's next?

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: What's next?

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Holy smokes, I
couldn't refute it.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.760 align:middle line:84%
So when my money started
going south again,

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't willing
to let it go this soon,

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:05.432 align:middle line:84%
I threw the I Ching,
which is my touchstone.

00:24:05.432 --> 00:24:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I call the I Ching the inner
voice for the hard of hearing.

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:08.760 align:middle line:90%
You read it.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm, for
the hard of hearing--

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.275 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:24:10.275 --> 00:24:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And it said,
no-- no affirmations.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So I close my eyes
and I ask Knowing.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.050 align:middle line:90%
Can I do affirmations?

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:18.790 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:19.660 align:middle line:90%
So I did nothing.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.275 align:middle line:84%
I sat there like
a bump on the log.

00:24:21.275 --> 00:24:25.330 align:middle line:84%
A year and a half later, I get
busted by the DEA, the feds--

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.430 align:middle line:90%
a 10-year prison sentence.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:28.827 align:middle line:90%
I'm in for 10 years.

00:24:28.827 --> 00:24:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how old are
your kids at this point,

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.868 align:middle line:84%
just to kind of get a
framework for everything?

00:24:32.868 --> 00:24:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Yeah, Benjamin
was 12, and Rebecca was 9.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.378 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, all right.

00:24:36.378 --> 00:24:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Rebecca
comes-- my bail hearing--

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:38.830 align:middle line:90%
we're all hippies.

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.372 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
raised among hippies.

00:24:40.372 --> 00:24:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Rebecca
is 9 years old.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.905 align:middle line:84%
And one of my
friends told me later

00:24:46.905 --> 00:24:48.280 align:middle line:84%
when I got out of
prison that she

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.960 align:middle line:84%
turned to Rebecca at the
bail hearing and said,

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.680 align:middle line:84%
well, Rebecca, what do
you think of all this?

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And Rebecca looked
at her and said,

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.190 align:middle line:90%
well, I'm reading "Anne Frank."

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:58.690 align:middle line:90%
And this isn't that bad.

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:00.607 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: (LAUGHING) I'm
reading "Anne Frank."

00:25:00.607 --> 00:25:01.450 align:middle line:90%
It isn't that bad.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Pragmatic girl--
she'd seen it all.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.170 align:middle line:90%
She was a hippie, herself, so.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: A year before
this happens to me,

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Benjamin-- two years before--
gets burned in a fire.

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: On Union
Street-- that's

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.393 align:middle line:90%
why we left Union-- burned down.

00:25:12.393 --> 00:25:14.810 align:middle line:84%
He got second and third degree
burns, put in the hospital.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: A year later, two
years later, his friend,

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Rawson Marshall Thurber,
Marshall's son--

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.990 align:middle line:84%
who was later going
to make "Dodgeball,"

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.290 align:middle line:84%
"Meet the Millers," become the
Hollywood star that he is--

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:32.300 align:middle line:84%
cuts his fingers off and
gets them sewn back on.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So Benjamin goes to see Rawson,
his friend, in the hospital.

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Comes back-- I'm
driving Benjamin.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.280 align:middle line:90%
This is Marin County.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.778 align:middle line:90%
Benjamin is in the back seat.

00:25:40.778 --> 00:25:42.070 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you know, Benjamin.

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:43.445 align:middle line:84%
I said, Rawson's
in a lot of pain

00:25:43.445 --> 00:25:46.800 align:middle line:84%
like you were last-- when
you were in the hospital.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And Benjamin says,
I wasn't in pain.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, no, during
the fire, you know,

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.420 align:middle line:90%
when you were in the hospital.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:00.450 align:middle line:90%
He said, I wasn't in pain.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:01.250 align:middle line:90%
My body was.

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:02.917 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, he
knew the difference.

00:26:02.917 --> 00:26:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: When I realized
that, it was all right.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
wow, profound-- kid.

00:26:07.555 --> 00:26:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: So I have
these kids that were--

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.570 align:middle line:84%
it was almost set
that I was going

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:16.890 align:middle line:84%
to have this life of turmoil,
that got close to destruction,

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:22.085 align:middle line:84%
self-destruction, but
never over the edge.

00:26:22.085 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
that's profound

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.580 align:middle line:84%
that your kids had that amount
of wisdom at those ages.

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.205 align:middle line:84%
So you wrote a book when
you were in prison, called--

00:26:29.205 --> 00:26:30.330 align:middle line:90%
was it "Light in the Dark"?

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: "Light
in a Dark Place."

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "Light
in a Dark Place."

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: I wrote it
when I was out of prison.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.320 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Out of prison,
OK-- about the experience.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.040 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHOON: Yeah, in prison.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.690 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Can you
talk about just--

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:38.160 align:middle line:10%
we don't want to spend
too much time there,

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.450 align:middle line:10%
because we've got
finances to go to.

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: OK.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.102 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Back to money, right?

00:26:41.102 --> 00:26:46.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what-- after
everything, now you're quiet.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:49.675 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: I am
meditating, like--

00:26:49.675 --> 00:26:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're in
prison, meditating.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Oh, yeah.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.597 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your world has gone
quiet and in a way peaceful.

00:26:54.597 --> 00:26:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: And peaceful, yeah.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And the diversion that's
the outside world is gone.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:01.010 align:middle line:90%
My joke-- joke--

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:02.590 align:middle line:90%
this is how my jokes are.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:05.530 align:middle line:84%
My joke is, prison was
a monastery I never

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:06.340 align:middle line:90%
would have join--

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.630 align:middle line:84%
I never would have
entered on my own.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.943 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: But it was
the learning experience

00:27:09.943 --> 00:27:11.810 align:middle line:84%
that my higher
self knew I needed.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.280 align:middle line:90%
I meditated.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we were--

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Marshall came to see
me later on in Tucson.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, Darryl, did
you do weights in prison?

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:20.230 align:middle line:90%
I go, no, no, no, I didn't.

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:21.227 align:middle line:90%
And Marshall goes, why?

00:27:21.227 --> 00:27:22.310 align:middle line:90%
And Martha answers for me.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:23.560 align:middle line:10%
She said, they were too heavy.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.130 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.930 align:middle line:10%
But I meditated.

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.347 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
but you meditated.

00:27:27.347 --> 00:27:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And in it,
unexpectedly, I was there.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.420 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't meditating
to get there.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.760 align:middle line:84%
I was meditating to
get out of there.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And probably-- I don't even
know how long I was there.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.790 align:middle line:90%
But I was there.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:42.935 align:middle line:90%
Regina, I knew.

00:27:42.935 --> 00:27:45.060 align:middle line:84%
All those things that all
those people did to get--

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:45.790 align:middle line:90%
I was there.

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: I-- at one moment, in
that space, somebody yelled out

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:50.370 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:51.400 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Schoon, wake up.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And this voice in my
head said, I am awake.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.163 align:middle line:90%
It is you who are still asleep.

00:27:57.163 --> 00:27:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, you don't tell people.

00:27:58.330 --> 00:27:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, I'm
talking to God.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:27:59.950 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:00.610 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: And then it went away.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:03.850 align:middle line:90%
It went away.

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:07.150 align:middle line:84%
I know the difference between
that state and where I am now.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:10.360 align:middle line:84%
I know the difference
between where I am now

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.590 align:middle line:90%
and where I was then.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.277 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And maybe
where I am now

00:28:13.277 --> 00:28:15.820 align:middle line:90%
is affected by where I was then.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.350 align:middle line:90%
But it is not there.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.270 align:middle line:90%
But I was there, all right?

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.780 align:middle line:90%
So and I didn't tell anybody.

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:21.580 align:middle line:90%
I didn't.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.420 align:middle line:90%
But I wrote it down.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a bunch of sayings I
wrote when I was in that state,

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:26.050 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:27.633 align:middle line:84%
And this is how the
book gets written.

00:28:27.633 --> 00:28:28.842 align:middle line:90%
In 1999, Marshall calls me.

00:28:28.842 --> 00:28:30.550 align:middle line:84%
My friend from law
school said, Darryl, I

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:32.300 align:middle line:84%
want you to read a
book-- the same guy who

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.980 align:middle line:84%
turned me onto "Course in
Miracles" and "Lazy Man's Way

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.040 align:middle line:90%
to Riches."

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.900 align:middle line:84%
He said, but I want you
to call up somebody.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.820 align:middle line:84%
So I call up this
person, Connie Kellough.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:40.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who she is.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.938 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Marshall wants me--
he says, you've got a book.

00:28:42.938 --> 00:28:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Marshall, Marshall.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Connie Kellough is publisher
of Namaste Publishing.

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.140 align:middle line:84%
They've pub-- she was
Eckhart Tolle's publisher

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:90%
of "The Power of Now."

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.650 align:middle line:84%
It was not yet published
in the United States.

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And Marshall told
me to call her up,

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:56.770 align:middle line:84%
because he wanted her
to send me a copy.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:57.790 align:middle line:90%
She sends me a copy.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:58.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm reading it.

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:00.010 align:middle line:90%
I went, holy smokes.

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Some of the stuff I wrote
is where Eckhart said.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Eckhart said, the mind
will pull you into the future.

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Your emotions will
pull you in the past.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: One of the things I
wrote when I was in that state

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.010 align:middle line:90%
was this.

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:15.895 align:middle line:84%
Will a future that never happens
determine what I do today?

00:29:15.895 --> 00:29:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Will a past that ever lingers
be the reason I feel this way?

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: It was right there.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful-- it was.

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: It was right there.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you were
There with a capital T.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: I sent--

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Marshall says, send
these to Connie.

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Connie asked for
permission to distribute

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.930 align:middle line:84%
these at Eckhart's seminars
in Vancouver in the year 2000.

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:36.070 align:middle line:90%
So I write this stuff.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.240 align:middle line:90%
And I was there.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.590 align:middle line:90%
I get out of prison.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:40.270 align:middle line:84%
The last year I'm
in prison-- this

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:42.560 align:middle line:84%
is what we're
talking about today.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.840 align:middle line:84%
September, 1991, I've
got six months to go--

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.790 align:middle line:90%
Terminal Island, California.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.320 align:middle line:90%
And I hear these words.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:55.600 align:middle line:84%
In times of expansion, it is
to the hare the prize goes.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Quick, risk taking, and bold,
his qualities are exactly

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.000 align:middle line:90%
suited to the times.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.420 align:middle line:84%
In times of contraction,
the tortoise is favored.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Quick only to retract his
vulnerable head and neck,

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.780 align:middle line:84%
the slow and sure is preferable
to the quick and easy.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.360 align:middle line:84%
There comes a time, however,
when neither the hare

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.040 align:middle line:90%
nor the tortoise is the victor.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.178 align:middle line:90%
This is the time of the vulture.

00:30:17.178 --> 00:30:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And the vulture feeds neither
upon the stored up wealth

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:22.380 align:middle line:84%
of the bear or the
patches of the bull, which

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.600 align:middle line:84%
lie buried beneath a rubble
of economic collapse.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.010 align:middle line:84%
The vulture feeds upon the
blind denial and ignorance

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:31.000 align:middle line:90%
of the ostrich.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.070 align:middle line:84%
The time of the
vulture is at hand.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gives me chills.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.010 align:middle line:90%
So let's move into it.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.830 align:middle line:84%
So you began understanding
how economy works.

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:42.990 align:middle line:84%
You began understanding
power structures.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: I already--
power structures

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:46.620 align:middle line:90%
was the background to this.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Metaphysics was the background.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Into that background drops this
obsession with the economy.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.400 align:middle line:90%
I turned to Martha.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.400 align:middle line:90%
I said, what am I doing?

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.900 align:middle line:90%
This 1990s in San Francisco.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm reading everything I
can about the Depression,

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.107 align:middle line:90%
about money.

00:31:00.107 --> 00:31:01.440 align:middle line:90%
And I'm led to the right people.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.410 align:middle line:84%
I run across Dr. Antal
Fekete on the web.

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:05.820 align:middle line:90%
And he's brilliant.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.110 align:middle line:90%
He was a rebel-- brilliant.

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:10.350 align:middle line:84%
I wrote him admiring
something he wrote.

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:11.910 align:middle line:90%
He said, when it happens--

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:18.170 align:middle line:84%
when the collapse happens,
he said, the central banks

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:20.540 align:middle line:84%
will cut interest rates
and give the banks

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.340 align:middle line:84%
cheap interest rates,
which they will not

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:23.420 align:middle line:90%
pass on to the customers.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They'll buy up
their own stocks or whatever.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: They will use it to
arbitrage their own advantage.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:27.830 align:middle line:90%
It will never reach--

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And I went,
what an insight.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.717 align:middle line:84%
I have read everything I
can and all these pundits.

00:31:32.717 --> 00:31:33.800 align:middle line:90%
No one has ever said that.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.570 align:middle line:90%
So I wrote Professor Fekete.

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Dear Professor Fekete.

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:37.700 align:middle line:90%
He writes me back.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.600 align:middle line:90%
He even remembered, years later.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.390 align:middle line:84%
He wrote me back
something so daunting.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:43.370 align:middle line:90%
All he said was this.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:47.210 align:middle line:84%
What is your-- what is your
interest in these matters?

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:48.530 align:middle line:90%
I never wrote him back.

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:50.820 align:middle line:84%
What is your interest in
the-- well, I'm a hippy.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.070 align:middle line:90%
And I've been thinking about--

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:53.695 align:middle line:84%
but I was thinking
about it, all right?

00:31:53.695 --> 00:31:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Benjamin graduates from MIT.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.420 align:middle line:84%
All those kids are
living in San Francisco

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:57.670 align:middle line:90%
making over $100 grand a year.

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're making a huge--
and rents are skyrocketing.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.180 align:middle line:90%
The bubble is happening.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.080 align:middle line:90%
It blows up.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:03.880 align:middle line:90%
I saw it.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.700 align:middle line:90%
I understood it.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:08.600 align:middle line:84%
In 2004, Marshall puts together
the Positive Deviant Network.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.580 align:middle line:90%
And do you know of a girl?

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.625 align:middle line:84%
Her name is Danielle
DiMartino Booth.

00:32:13.625 --> 00:32:14.832 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-uh.

00:32:14.832 --> 00:32:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: She's big now.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.670 align:middle line:84%
She has a thing called
Quill Consulting--

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.310 align:middle line:90%
Danielle DiMartino Booth, OK?

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: This is how I'm led.

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm reading.

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:27.130 align:middle line:84%
In 2006, there's an article
on the real estate market

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:29.600 align:middle line:90%
in the "Dallas Morning Sun."

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's-- it is the real
estate bubble, subprime.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: She's writing about
it, but with uncommon, uncommon

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:37.330 align:middle line:90%
insight.

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:38.705 align:middle line:84%
She's talking
about Fed Central--

00:32:38.705 --> 00:32:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and, wow, she put
a context on it.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:41.830 align:middle line:90%
So I wrote her.

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:43.510 align:middle line:90%
And she writes me back.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:46.340 align:middle line:90%
She is now-- she's big.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.140 align:middle line:90%
You can find her.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I'll look for her.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:48.640 align:middle line:90%
I've written her down.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: You should
have her on, yeah.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:49.345 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:49.345 --> 00:32:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: She might
be interesting.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: I think she
would be interesting.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:52.170 align:middle line:90%
She's a woman.

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.080 align:middle line:90%
She understands this.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no,
I'll try to get to her.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.382 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: She was later hired
by Richard Fisher at the Dallas

00:32:56.382 --> 00:32:57.940 align:middle line:90%
Fed because of her insight.

00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:58.870 align:middle line:90%
She left Fisher.

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:00.350 align:middle line:90%
She's now consulting on her own.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: You will love her.

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:03.683 align:middle line:90%
I've never written to her since.

00:33:03.683 --> 00:33:05.680 align:middle line:84%
But I'm reading
her article, wow.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.740 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote-- that
letter that I wrote back

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.810 align:middle line:84%
became the basis of
"Time of the Vulture."

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:14.110 align:middle line:84%
I present a 148-page paper at
Marshall's Positivity Network.

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:16.480 align:middle line:90%
I predict this collapse.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.190 align:middle line:90%
All hell broke loose.

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And they've done
what they've done.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.470 align:middle line:90%
And what I want to say is this.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:24.390 align:middle line:84%
The time of the vulture
hasn't happened yet.

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:26.250 align:middle line:84%
The time of the
vulture is in progress.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're 12, 13 years
closer to its end

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:84%
than we were when I
predicted it in March, 2007.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:35.520 align:middle line:84%
The time of the vulture
is absolute collapse.

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell us
what that time frame is.

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:40.297 align:middle line:84%
You said, we're 12 or 13 years
closer than we were in 2007.

00:33:40.297 --> 00:33:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: When I
made-- wrote my book.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, so how--

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:45.600 align:middle line:90%
you said, it's not at hand yet.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.490 align:middle line:90%
When do you foresee--

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: It's at hand,
but it's not happened yet.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.453 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not happened yet.

00:33:49.453 --> 00:33:50.940 align:middle line:90%
When-- what time frame--

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.917 align:middle line:84%
kind of-- we're not
going to hold you to it.

00:33:52.917 --> 00:33:54.000 align:middle line:90%
What relative time frames?

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.375 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: I would
say, two years.

00:33:55.375 --> 00:33:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In two years-- so
now, let's continue the story.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:59.850 align:middle line:84%
What this means--
you've written about it.

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:02.662 align:middle line:84%
And you've used
metaphors before.

00:34:02.662 --> 00:34:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: My current
metaphor is just something

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.760 align:middle line:90%
that came to me this week.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's a toilet, all right?

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:12.288 align:middle line:84%
And I'm only using the metaphor
because of certain things,

00:34:12.288 --> 00:34:13.830 align:middle line:84%
which people
understand, and the fact

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:16.739 align:middle line:84%
that it's critical to
our life as we know it.

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:19.377 align:middle line:84%
Now, toilets never were critical
to our life as we know it.

00:34:19.377 --> 00:34:20.460 align:middle line:90%
Going to the bathroom was.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:21.389 align:middle line:90%
Outhouses were.

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Every culture had
no indoor toilets.

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:27.900 align:middle line:84%
The toilet is a
modern contraption,

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.710 align:middle line:90%
that is so popular.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And money-- and
money is a relatively modern

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.760 align:middle line:90%
contraption, yeah.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.909 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Same thing-- it, too,
is a contraption, all right?

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:38.060 align:middle line:84%
When it was invented-- the
toilet, the modern toilet--

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.300 align:middle line:84%
the toilet is a metaphor for
capit-- for modern banking--

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:45.440 align:middle line:84%
for modern banking, where
banking is no longer gold

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.659 align:middle line:90%
and silver, hard value.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:50.630 align:middle line:84%
It's the issuance
of paper backed

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:54.080 align:middle line:90%
by hard value in the form--

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.400 align:middle line:90%
see everybody goes to there.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.760 align:middle line:84%
So people who go-- most
people think, money has value.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.690 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Money had value--
paper money-- only when

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.300 align:middle line:84%
it was convertible to gold and
silver, or copper as in China.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:08.090 align:middle line:84%
When that connection was
cut, it had no value per se

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:10.770 align:middle line:90%
except faith or belief.

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:12.120 align:middle line:90%
So it's a construct.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.940 align:middle line:90%
And that ended in 1971.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: But the real
purpose of this was not to us.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.980 align:middle line:84%
We just used it to buy
goods and services.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.770 align:middle line:84%
The real purpose, the
real advantage of money

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:26.870 align:middle line:90%
was to the bankers.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.450 align:middle line:84%
They issued these
pieces of paper.

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Money never was a form
of credit and debt

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:33.630 align:middle line:90%
before the bankers came along.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:34.820 align:middle line:90%
It was just money.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.220 align:middle line:90%
After the bankers got control--

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:40.790 align:middle line:84%
invented the toilet--
everything in that toilet

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:45.440 align:middle line:84%
was credit and debt in
motion, flowing through,

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.600 align:middle line:90%
controlled by the bankers.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And the only people
who could use

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:53.170 align:middle line:84%
that toilet in the beginning
were the King of England

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and corporations like
the British West Indies.

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:57.040 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't used in France.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.540 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't used in
the United States.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.700 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't used anywhere in
the world, only England.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And how
they did it was this.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.250 align:middle line:84%
The bankers-- William
Patterson was a Scotsman.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And the King of
England, William III,

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.580 align:middle line:84%
had huge debts,
billions of dollars,

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:15.003 align:middle line:84%
going to war with his
relatives in France.

00:36:15.003 --> 00:36:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Always wise.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Always wise.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.520 align:middle line:90%
And they went to him.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.060 align:middle line:90%
And they said, listen.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:25.040 align:middle line:84%
We will float you a loan to
pay off your debts if you

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.430 align:middle line:84%
issue us the right
to issue circulating

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:30.920 align:middle line:90%
letters of credit and debt.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, he had no idea what
this meant, all right?

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.080 align:middle line:84%
So he gives a charge
to the Bank of England,

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.240 align:middle line:84%
which is the first central
bank in England now.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.410 align:middle line:90%
They now issue money.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:44.698 align:middle line:90%
He never expected it.

00:36:44.698 --> 00:36:46.740 align:middle line:84%
He thought credit and debt
is a commercial thing.

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:50.100 align:middle line:84%
They started issuing paper
pound notes as money.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.990 align:middle line:84%
They never had paper
pound notes before.

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:53.630 align:middle line:90%
It was coins.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:54.430 align:middle line:90%
It was coins.

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:55.230 align:middle line:90%
That's all it was.

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:56.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: All right, half
pence or penny, quid or--

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:00.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what they call it.

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:02.547 align:middle line:84%
You know all those
children's rhymes

00:37:02.547 --> 00:37:03.630 align:middle line:90%
that they have in England.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:04.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what they were.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: A half penny.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: All right, so there's
these pound notes floating

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.060 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:13.720 align:middle line:84%
But they're only issued in
the form of a loan, as credit.

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what they
paid him off with, his paper

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.570 align:middle line:90%
money.

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Paper money.

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:19.128 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: So he paid
off-- but what he could do

00:37:19.128 --> 00:37:21.280 align:middle line:84%
is he could borrow more
money and go to war on it.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.560 align:middle line:84%
England was the only
country that could borrow--

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.600 align:middle line:90%
that could go to war on credit.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.340 align:middle line:84%
That's how they
became a world power.

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.307 align:middle line:84%
They went from a
crap-ass little island,

00:37:29.307 --> 00:37:30.640 align:middle line:90%
sitting off the coast of Europe.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:34.612 align:middle line:84%
And boom-- 150 years
later, sun did not set.

00:37:34.612 --> 00:37:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they had credit--

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: They had credit.

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to
finance their wars.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.422 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Wars-- and
they could pay it back

00:37:39.422 --> 00:37:40.540 align:middle line:90%
as long as they want.

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And then they got
to the point where

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.960 align:middle line:90%
they couldn't win anymore.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.030 align:middle line:90%
India was already too big.

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:49.250 align:middle line:84%
They were having
trouble digesting India.

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And they went after China
and the United State--

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:52.698 align:middle line:90%
China and Russia.

00:37:52.698 --> 00:37:53.990 align:middle line:90%
They were the two big ones, OK?

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Now Marx always said
that capitalism,

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.770 align:middle line:84%
which is the toilet, would
fail because the workers--

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:00.393 align:middle line:84%
the ones in the
toilet-- would rise up

00:38:00.393 --> 00:38:01.560 align:middle line:90%
against being in the toilet.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Screw him.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.440 align:middle line:90%
He was wrong.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.230 align:middle line:84%
The workers absolutely
enjoyed being in the toilet.

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.150 align:middle line:84%
For the first time,
they're actually swimming.

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:10.520 align:middle line:90%
They liked being in the toilet.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.180 align:middle line:84%
They didn't care if
they were in debt.

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:13.110 align:middle line:84%
They didn't care if
the credit card said--

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:15.350 align:middle line:90%
They could never go to school.

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:16.150 align:middle line:90%
So Marx was wrong.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: The communism
arose not with the workers.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Communism arose in feudal,
large, grand societies

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.740 align:middle line:84%
that knew that the
capitalists from the West

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.907 align:middle line:84%
were going to eat them up
unless they did something.

00:38:26.907 --> 00:38:28.852 align:middle line:84%
So they grabbed Marxism
as the only other book

00:38:28.852 --> 00:38:30.560 align:middle line:84%
and tried to make that
as an alternative.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't work, because
that was just a concept.

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, you're right.

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:34.550 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: It didn't work.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:35.840 align:middle line:90%
It had never been tried before.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Well,
capitalism was tried.

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:42.697 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is they
went from only the King

00:38:42.697 --> 00:38:44.780 align:middle line:84%
to the corporations, because
they knew they could.

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.910 align:middle line:90%
In fact, what happened--

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:49.460 align:middle line:84%
King William had so
many wars with France,

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.410 align:middle line:90%
he ended up with more debts.

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:54.650 align:middle line:84%
In 50 years, the kingdom--
the King of England--

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:57.620 align:middle line:84%
so many debts that
what they did is they

00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:59.150 align:middle line:90%
made-- this is important.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:03.200 align:middle line:84%
They made the debts that
he owed not just with him

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.150 align:middle line:90%
as a personal debt to royalty.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:07.340 align:middle line:90%
England now owned the debt.

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: And so England--

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:10.032 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sound familiar?

00:39:10.032 --> 00:39:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And England,
they nationalized the debt.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first
appearance of an income

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:20.026 align:middle line:84%
tax in England, because to
pay his debts that he could

00:39:20.026 --> 00:39:21.320 align:middle line:90%
no long-- he'd taken the debt.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He dumped
it on the people.

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: He dumped it onto
the people and walked away.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: OK, that's
what we're here for.

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:28.070 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're here for.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.840 align:middle line:90%
In the toilet, folks--

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.190 align:middle line:90%
in the toilet.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:32.580 align:middle line:90%
That's what we provide.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.260 align:middle line:84%
We provide the
stuff going around.

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.060 align:middle line:90%
We're part--

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it went
around and round.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And got bigger
and bigger and bigger--

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: --until it blew
up in the United States.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, why did it reach
the United States?

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:43.220 align:middle line:90%
We went to war.

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Jefferson said there
were two threats to America.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Jefferson,
founding father--

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:51.830 align:middle line:84%
two threats to America--
standing armies

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:53.510 align:middle line:90%
and private bankers.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.828 align:middle line:84%
Because he says, the army
is only going to get bigger.

00:39:55.828 --> 00:39:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be
at war all the time.

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you have private bankers,
everyone's going to be in debt.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.873 align:middle line:84%
They fought off-- that's what
Aaron Burr was all about.

00:40:02.873 --> 00:40:04.040 align:middle line:90%
He was a private banker guy.

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:07.100 align:middle line:84%
They fought it off,
fought it off until 1913,

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.660 align:middle line:90%
until they came in.

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.868 align:middle line:84%
A consortium of European
banks came to United States.

00:40:10.868 --> 00:40:12.577 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why it
happened was this--

00:40:12.577 --> 00:40:14.030 align:middle line:90%
not because of what we did--

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:17.900 align:middle line:84%
because the bankers in England
saw that it was failing there.

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.840 align:middle line:84%
England had reached its
expansion of its empire.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.550 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize, credit and
debt has to continue to expand.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:24.350 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Because debt
compounds every night.

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.930 align:middle line:84%
When you wake up tomorrow,
Regina, if you do nothing,

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:32.740 align:middle line:84%
you're going to owe more
tomorrow than you do today.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:35.240 align:middle line:84%
That's all-- everybody is going
to owe more tomorrow than we

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:39.140 align:middle line:84%
do today-- everyone,
everyone, the person cleaning

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:43.010 align:middle line:84%
the room at Four Seasons,
Four Seasons, who's

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:46.400 align:middle line:90%
leasing it to their banker.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.520 align:middle line:84%
The guy who-- the consortium
of investors that owns

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.650 align:middle line:90%
Four Seasons owes the bankers.

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:54.620 align:middle line:84%
So everybody's debt is
continually ticking, all right?

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.490 align:middle line:84%
So the debt load is
going to get bigger.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:59.520 align:middle line:84%
So the economy has to get
bigger to pay the debt.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.440 align:middle line:84%
That's why they're so
obsessed with growth.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: We've got this--

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.153 align:middle line:84%
if you stop growing,
you can't pay the debt.

00:41:05.153 --> 00:41:06.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's a house of cards.

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:09.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a house of cards.

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:12.740 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is that when
England reached its limit,

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.360 align:middle line:90%
they began getting worried.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.690 align:middle line:84%
All right, so 80
years later, they--

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:21.797 align:middle line:84%
they shift their focus from
England to the United States.

00:41:21.797 --> 00:41:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And the Federal Reserve
in the United States

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:27.647 align:middle line:84%
is a carbon copy
of Bank of England.

00:41:27.647 --> 00:41:28.730 align:middle line:90%
Same thing happened to us.

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is like "Creature
From Jekyll Island" stuff,

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:30.576 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:41:30.576 --> 00:41:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Jekyll Island-- that's a story.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:32.750 align:middle line:90%
That's a real story, yeah.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's a real story.

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Well, what
happened is that we became--

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:40.227 align:middle line:84%
when we had the same
privilege of the toilet,

00:41:40.227 --> 00:41:42.560 align:middle line:84%
we did the same thing with
the toilet that England did--

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:43.880 align:middle line:90%
empire.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.040 align:middle line:84%
But it happened inadvertently,
because we've always

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.390 align:middle line:90%
been sort of isolationist.

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's stay out of the
way of other people.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.295 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to
screw anybody, it'd

00:41:50.295 --> 00:41:52.460 align:middle line:84%
be South America, because
we're close to them.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:53.870 align:middle line:84%
But let's basically
sort of stay out of it.

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mexico, too.

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Or Mexico--
well, they're even closer.

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.273 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: You know what one
of the sayings in Mexico is?

00:41:58.273 --> 00:42:00.978 align:middle line:84%
Oh, poor Mexico--
so far away from God

00:42:00.978 --> 00:42:02.270 align:middle line:90%
and close to the United States.

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, true.

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: That's their saying.

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: All right,
so what happened

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:11.030 align:middle line:84%
is that we inherited the
advantages and disadvantages

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:12.560 align:middle line:90%
of paper money.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.950 align:middle line:84%
We thought an advantage
of paper money was empire.

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:18.290 align:middle line:84%
That's a disadvantage,
because it'll kill you.

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:22.400 align:middle line:84%
It'll kill you, because
empire is insatiable.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.440 align:middle line:90%
It was our empire--

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.260 align:middle line:84%
the cost of empire after
World War II, when we already

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.410 align:middle line:84%
basically owned the world,
that all our gold left.

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Between-- in 1949, we had
more gold than any country

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:34.160 align:middle line:90%
in the world--

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.770 align:middle line:90%
21,775 tons.

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:39.800 align:middle line:84%
That's probably 80% of the
monetary gold in the world.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.318 align:middle line:84%
20 years later, we were
down to 8,000 tons.

00:42:42.318 --> 00:42:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And we had a positive trade
imbalance during that time.

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:46.040 align:middle line:90%
So we should have had more gold.

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.498 align:middle line:84%
The gold went out because we
had to pay all these countries

00:42:48.498 --> 00:42:52.340 align:middle line:84%
for the foreign deployment of
troops, our navies, everything.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:56.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we pulled
the dollar out of gold,

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:58.095 align:middle line:90%
which destabilized the toilet.

00:42:58.095 --> 00:42:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everything.

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Yeah,
but you know what?

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:03.790 align:middle line:90%
That credit and debt thing--

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:05.530 align:middle line:84%
this was the banker's
golden goose.

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the handle.

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Yes, credit and debt.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.365 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the handle.

00:43:09.365 --> 00:43:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: What happened is all
they had to do to make money--

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:15.550 align:middle line:84%
they lived off of
everybody's productivity.

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:17.350 align:middle line:84%
All they had to do
was make sure there

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:20.620 align:middle line:84%
was a balance between
credit and debt, OK?

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened is
that when the toilet broke

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:28.990 align:middle line:90%
in 1930s-- and it did--

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:31.617 align:middle line:84%
when '29 crashed and
all the banks went down,

00:43:31.617 --> 00:43:33.700 align:middle line:84%
that's when they realized
later that they couldn't

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.280 align:middle line:90%
allow the banks to go down.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Because if the banks, which are
the intermediaries of credit

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and debt, went down,
there is no society.

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:43.963 align:middle line:84%
So in 2007, when it happened,
they saved the banks.

00:43:43.963 --> 00:43:45.880 align:middle line:84%
That's why they went
immediately to save them,

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.980 align:middle line:84%
even though they had
caused the subprime crash.

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And the banks took that
and bonused themselves,

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:54.460 align:middle line:84%
because they knew the
government couldn't stop them,

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.247 align:middle line:90%
because they were king.

00:43:57.247 --> 00:43:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Too big to fail.

00:43:58.330 --> 00:43:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Too big to--

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:00.050 align:middle line:90%
truly, too big to fail.

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: It's not a saying.

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: It's a truth.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I hear
what you're saying.

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:05.280 align:middle line:84%
They were the solvent of
allowing society to continue.

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Continue.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:06.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is jiggling
the toilet handle didn't work.

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Before, it was just jiggling it.

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:14.760 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work.

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So money kept draining,
because deflation is draining.

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Deflation is what happens
when demand collapses.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.350 align:middle line:84%
When demand collapses,
prices collapse.

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:28.610 align:middle line:90%
Everything starts going down.

00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:31.010 align:middle line:90%
It's like a hole to drain into.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:33.980 align:middle line:84%
So those deflationary forces
were-- they happened in Japan

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.667 align:middle line:90%
in 1990, scared everybody.

00:44:35.667 --> 00:44:37.000 align:middle line:90%
They've never fixed it in Japan.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: It's happened to us
in the United States in 2008.

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And because we're
the world now, it

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:46.400 align:middle line:84%
started happening around the
world, but basically here.

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.890 align:middle line:90%
So they did a thing called QE.

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:52.040 align:middle line:84%
QE was where they didn't
depend on jiggling the handle.

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.185 align:middle line:90%
They started getting--

00:44:53.185 --> 00:44:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Buckets of water.

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:54.865 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: --buckets
of water-- poured it--

00:44:54.865 --> 00:44:56.573 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Pouring it
in the toilet, yeah.

00:44:56.573 --> 00:44:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Just-- but it
was all right until 2020.

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and now, you
talk about demand going down.

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:02.930 align:middle line:90%
You talk about--

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: They got a hose going
directly from the water main

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:09.160 align:middle line:90%
into the toilet.

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:09.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's still draining.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It never fills up.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: No, no.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:12.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to.

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, let's
look at right now.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.730 align:middle line:90%
Just stop it right there.

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Now, what happens?

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.570 align:middle line:90%
It can never fill.

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:22.130 align:middle line:84%
The need of people
is greater than--

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Ever was.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --probably
since the Depression.

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know how
this is going to end up.

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: You're right.

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Globally.

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: I know.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So now what?

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Buckminster Fuller
predicted this in 1981

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:35.095 align:middle line:90%
in his book.

00:45:35.095 --> 00:45:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Marshall was a close
friend of Bucky's.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, he was, yeah.

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: He knew.

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:40.690 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't know if
you know anything about C60.

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:41.940 align:middle line:90%
We have a company we're doing.

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.423 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I
know C60, yeah--

00:45:43.423 --> 00:45:44.340 align:middle line:90%
the carbon, carbon 60.

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Yeah,
Marshall, Martha, and I

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:46.760 align:middle line:90%
are partners in it.

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:47.898 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:47.898 --> 00:45:49.315 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Marshall
was with Bucky.

00:45:49.315 --> 00:45:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Buckyball technology.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:51.063 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Buckyball.

00:45:51.063 --> 00:45:52.690 align:middle line:90%
Marshall was with Bucky in 1979.

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:55.210 align:middle line:84%
He was close to Bucky at
the end of Bucky's life.

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:58.660 align:middle line:84%
All right, and he said, Bucky
was talking about structures

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:00.930 align:middle line:90%
of squares, triangles.

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:03.077 align:middle line:84%
He said, triangles are
much more structurally

00:46:03.077 --> 00:46:03.910 align:middle line:90%
sound than a square.

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:04.995 align:middle line:90%
Squares, they fold.

00:46:04.995 --> 00:46:05.880 align:middle line:90%
They bend like that.

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.490 align:middle line:84%
He said, but the strongest
structure has not yet

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:10.500 align:middle line:90%
been basically discovered.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a carbon 60 molecule.

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.200 align:middle line:90%
It'll be the lightest.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.033 align:middle line:90%
And he described it.

00:46:14.033 --> 00:46:17.380 align:middle line:84%
They built-- we've seen the
plastic model that he built

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:19.920 align:middle line:84%
with Marshall at
Marshall's house in 1979--

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.390 align:middle line:90%
carbon 60.

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:25.690 align:middle line:84%
It was discovered in '85, three
years after Bucky had died.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: All right,
well, in 1981, Bucky

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.960 align:middle line:90%
wrote his last major book.

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.400 align:middle line:90%
His last book that is--

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.650 align:middle line:90%
wrote, I suggest you read.

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:37.245 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Grunch of
Giants," the global--

00:46:37.245 --> 00:46:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Grunch?

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: --cash
heist of corporations.

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:45.900 align:middle line:10%
"The Grunch of Giants"-- it
was published posthumously.

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.420 align:middle line:84%
But his last major book
was called "Critical Path."

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:50.370 align:middle line:90%
And he wrote it in 1981.

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:52.470 align:middle line:90%
He died in '83.

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:54.160 align:middle line:90%
And Bucky was a visionary.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.627 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: In the true
sense of the word.

00:46:56.627 --> 00:46:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: The story behind
Bucky is really fascinating.

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I love his story.

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:00.780 align:middle line:90%
We--

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: OK, we have time.

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have only a
little bit of time for that.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:03.620 align:middle line:90%


00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:05.912 align:middle line:84%
And then we got to get to
what he said about this time.

00:47:05.912 --> 00:47:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: He said,
in 1981, humanity

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:14.160 align:middle line:84%
is entering a period of
unprecedented crises.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.050 align:middle line:84%
He titled the introduction
to "Critical Path,"

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Twilight of the World's
Power Structures.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: He said
economic, political,

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and all religious institutions
are going to collapse--

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.200 align:middle line:90%
all of them.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said, mankind is in final
exam for continued existence

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.700 align:middle line:90%
in the universe--

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.890 align:middle line:90%
continued existence.

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Bucky said that as far as
he was able to ascertain,

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.340 align:middle line:84%
we had a role here
in the universe.

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And the role was we were
sort of like problem solvers.

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:45.490 align:middle line:90%
We had brains.

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:47.875 align:middle line:84%
We had aware-- we could sol--
we could create and solve

00:47:47.875 --> 00:47:48.880 align:middle line:90%
problems.

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And we've basically
become problem creators.

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:55.840 align:middle line:84%
He said, the universe is
going to determine right now

00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.050 align:middle line:84%
whether or not we deserve
continued existence--

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:02.090 align:middle line:90%
continued existence.

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:06.470 align:middle line:84%
He said, there will not be
a decision made politically,

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:09.120 align:middle line:90%
economically, or religiously.

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not like all of
a sudden, the Muslims

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:13.300 align:middle line:84%
take over the set
or the Mormons.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.700 align:middle line:90%
The Mormons take over.

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: No, no.

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not because we go
one way or the other.

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:19.360 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's going to be made
in the hearts of every human

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.230 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.110 align:middle line:90%
And the choice is this.

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Do you want the happiness
of your fellow man

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.452 align:middle line:84%
as much as you want the
happiness of yourself?

00:48:26.452 --> 00:48:27.336 align:middle line:90%
[STRIKES TABLE]

00:48:27.336 --> 00:48:30.060 align:middle line:90%
That's it, cut and simple.

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:31.480 align:middle line:90%
Are we one?

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Do you know it?

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.190 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe it?

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:34.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's what the cut is.

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:38.940 align:middle line:84%
The crisis is going to make
those distinctions melt.

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.130 align:middle line:84%
This is going to
bring us to our knees

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:44.200 align:middle line:90%
with our arms around each other.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:49.060 align:middle line:84%
The purpose is for us to
see who we really are.

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:54.530 align:middle line:84%
We're not these discrete,
separate, fearful, temporary

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:56.160 align:middle line:90%
flickerings of life.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:59.210 align:middle line:90%
We are children of God.

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:04.160 align:middle line:84%
But we have created an illusion
of separateness, scarcity, war,

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and terror that we've made
real because of the power

00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:09.540 align:middle line:90%
that we were given.

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And we do this every moment
with our conscious minds

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:14.660 align:middle line:90%
and our unconscious minds.

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
opportunity then

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:21.740 align:middle line:84%
is to have some common
thing that brings everyone

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:23.810 align:middle line:84%
to their knees, so
to speak, so that we

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:27.410 align:middle line:84%
can begin letting those
differences dissolve

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:29.300 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
that in the end,

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.610 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be that
relationship and care for one

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:33.110 align:middle line:90%
another that takes us forward?

00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: I think--

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or is that too trite?

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:35.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: It's too big.

00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: I think
how it will happen--

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:41.780 align:middle line:84%
because we all live in
these discrete worlds.

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Discrete-- I mean, you're there.

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: You're not even in
the world that you're seeing.

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:48.470 align:middle line:84%
You know who's in the
world that you're seeing?

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.795 align:middle line:90%
Me.

00:49:48.795 --> 00:49:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: You're
looking in your world.

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At you.

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Regina--
There's Darryl.

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.570 align:middle line:84%
He was sitting
right in front of--

00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And you-- so our worlds
are totally different.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: The fears of
your sisters and brothers

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:00.500 align:middle line:90%
were different than yours.

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:03.300 align:middle line:84%
The fears of your par-- the
fears of you and your husband

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.100 align:middle line:90%
are different.

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:05.300 align:middle line:90%
Your desires are d--

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and we-- but because we
share the common set,

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:11.390 align:middle line:84%
we think the set is
more real than us.

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:13.940 align:middle line:90%
All it is, is a set.

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Enter stage left.

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Yes, all
it is, is a set.

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: But because
we agree on the set,

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:22.400 align:middle line:84%
we give it more
credence and belief

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.650 align:middle line:90%
than our experience of the set.

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is
what Jesus said.

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:28.370 align:middle line:90%
Ye are gods.

00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But nonetheless,
the ability to create, free

00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:36.770 align:middle line:84%
will, also the ability to
love beyond comprehension.

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:39.030 align:middle line:84%
We have all of these
contrasting parts of ourself.

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: At parts of ourself.

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And, Regina, when
I read that book, it said,

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:44.965 align:middle line:90%
you are using thought.

00:50:44.965 --> 00:50:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
critical path book?

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: No, no, it was
called "Thinking and Destiny"--

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:51.270 align:middle line:84%
the one that I read right before
my 10-year prison sentence.

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, OK.

00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Well, "The
Course in Miracles"

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:54.990 align:middle line:84%
even said, some of the
most painful experiences,

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:56.110 align:middle line:90%
you learn the most from.

00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:56.910 align:middle line:90%
And I know that.

00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: I know that if
I hadn't gone to prison,

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:01.147 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't be with Martha today.

00:51:01.147 --> 00:51:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, most people do--

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.188 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: I had to go
through that stuff,

00:51:04.188 --> 00:51:07.120 align:middle line:84%
so I could mellow out myself,
so somebody like Martha

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:09.690 align:middle line:84%
could even tolerate
me in her life.

00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:10.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm so extreme.

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: All right, and I knew.

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:19.670 align:middle line:84%
I called prison--
in my novel, I said,

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:24.750 align:middle line:84%
prison was a cage I learned
to share with my feelings.

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:26.900 align:middle line:90%
I thought about Gaia.

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:30.830 align:middle line:84%
The word "Gaia"
is for the mother.

00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:32.450 align:middle line:84%
This book called,
"Right Use of Will"

00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:36.060 align:middle line:90%
said, the problem with reality--

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:37.560 align:middle line:90%
reality is a construct.

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:40.110 align:middle line:84%
It's an interplay between
the spirit and the will.

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:44.250 align:middle line:84%
The will is what you call
the male awareness aspect.

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:48.000 align:middle line:84%
The spirit is the feeling
aspect in one sense.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.100 align:middle line:84%
It's what you call the
feminine, the mother, Gaia.

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:58.400 align:middle line:84%
The problem is how
you treated the will.

00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.788 align:middle line:90%
You have suppressed the will.

00:51:59.788 --> 00:52:03.477 align:middle line:84%
You have de-- the will
manifests to you as feelings.

00:52:03.477 --> 00:52:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And most of you have suppressed
your feelings to such a degree

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:10.470 align:middle line:84%
that all that comes up is
fear, loss, terror, rage.

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing everything
you can to avoid the feelings.

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:15.390 align:middle line:84%
He said, this avoidance
of those feelings

00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:17.640 align:middle line:84%
is going to destroy
your reality,

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.410 align:middle line:90%
because those feelings are not--

00:52:19.410 --> 00:52:22.380 align:middle line:84%
you think, those feelings
are your response

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:23.557 align:middle line:90%
to an exterior situation.

00:52:23.557 --> 00:52:25.890 align:middle line:84%
They belong to the exterior,
which they're triggered by.

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And so they're associated
with an exterior situation.

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:31.200 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want
to tell you this.

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Those feelings are your reaction
to an exterior situation.

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Your reaction is a part of you.

00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:39.330 align:middle line:90%
They're part of your life.

00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And your denial
of those feelings

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:47.160 align:middle line:84%
of loss, terror, separation,
rage is killing them.

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.717 align:middle line:90%
And it will kill you.

00:52:48.717 --> 00:52:51.050 align:middle line:84%
If you have something in your
life that keeps coming up,

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:55.520 align:middle line:84%
like bad relationships, it's
because they want to be felt.

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:57.760 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want
to feel lonely,

00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:01.030 align:middle line:84%
you're going to keep feeling
lonely until you feel lonely

00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:02.810 align:middle line:90%
and let it go.

00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:07.550 align:middle line:84%
You have to go to your
feelings as a friend.

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:10.550 align:middle line:84%
The acceptance you're
looking for out there

00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:14.300 align:middle line:84%
is the acceptance your feelings
are looking for you inside.

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:16.340 align:middle line:84%
He said, in "Right
Use of Will," I

00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:18.170 align:middle line:84%
am going to bring down
the Earth changes,

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:22.550 align:middle line:84%
not to punish, but to trigger
emotions and feelings in you

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:24.540 align:middle line:84%
that you will not
release on your own.

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.190 align:middle line:90%
You have two choices.

00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:28.640 align:middle line:84%
You have two choices--
to voluntarily feel

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.890 align:middle line:84%
the feelings that are being
triggered you in your life

00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:34.670 align:middle line:84%
or to face an outer reflection
that this is so deep that you

00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:37.300 align:middle line:84%
can't avoid, like
a 10-year prison

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:40.320 align:middle line:90%
sentence of loss of power.

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And we're there now.

00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: And we're there now.

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:43.385 align:middle line:90%
It's about to happen.

00:53:43.385 --> 00:53:44.185 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:44.185 --> 00:53:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: So when you ask what
we can do, if I was to g--

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:50.820 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
who can hear that,

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:53.700 align:middle line:84%
because it appears
that what I just said

00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:57.300 align:middle line:84%
is so far away from what
the question you asked.

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.970 align:middle line:84%
You asked a question about
a total economic collapse.

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And I gave you
some weird answer.

00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, this is where
I wanted to go with it--

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:06.922 align:middle line:84%
from there to what really
matters now that we're--

00:54:06.922 --> 00:54:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: To what you can do.

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --where we are.

00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: Yeah, to
what you can do.

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What we
can each embrace,

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.320 align:middle line:84%
what we can each do,
what we can each even

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.450 align:middle line:90%
have some kind of faith in.

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: When I started
writing my articles in 2007,

00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:19.090 align:middle line:90%
I always had a byline.

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:19.890 align:middle line:90%
Buy gold.

00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:20.690 align:middle line:90%
Buy silver.

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Have faith.

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And in my book, which you
just finished reading, I mean,

00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:26.520 align:middle line:90%
faith is the hardest to come by.

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is, yeah.

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And you ought to--
and you should get it while the

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:30.140 align:middle line:90%
getting is still good.

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Well, we're here.

00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is,
you can't buy faith.

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think when
this is over, people

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:40.190 align:middle line:84%
are going to have-- the
ones who make it through

00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:41.810 align:middle line:84%
are going to have
more faith than they

00:54:41.810 --> 00:54:43.280 align:middle line:90%
did when they started.

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And the ones who
don't make it through

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:46.520 align:middle line:90%
may have more faith, too.

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say
something about this.

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.120 align:middle line:90%
Some may not make it through.

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:53.125 align:middle line:84%
And that's not bad, because
everything here is temporary.

00:54:53.125 --> 00:54:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've
been here before.

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: This is a set.

00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone
has been here before.

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: I have
friends that have just

00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:59.060 align:middle line:90%
died in the last month.

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:01.950 align:middle line:84%
The fact that they died means
nothing to me in that sense.

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:02.750 align:middle line:90%
There's a loss.

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Those are personal.

00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:04.830 align:middle line:90%
But I know that life goes on.

00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: And that's what I--

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:08.356 align:middle line:90%
I told you a saying.

00:55:08.356 --> 00:55:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And you said, well,
maybe we should use it

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:10.910 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the thing.

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:11.480 align:middle line:90%
And the saying--

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
we're there now.

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: The saying
came to me in prison.

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:15.490 align:middle line:90%
And it was this.

00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:19.990 align:middle line:84%
We are eternal lights passing
through temporal darkness.

00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:21.790 align:middle line:90%
We cannot be harmed.

00:55:21.790 --> 00:55:22.810 align:middle line:90%
We are love itself.

00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:25.223 align:middle line:90%


00:55:25.223 --> 00:55:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Darryl.

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And on that, we
will say goodbye.

00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so
much for sharing

00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:37.900 align:middle line:84%
such an incredibly passionate,
incredibly courageous,

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:40.690 align:middle line:84%
committed spiritual
journey that ended you up

00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:43.090 align:middle line:90%
in some really weird places.

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:46.210 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHOON: I want to thank you
for giving me the opportunity

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:51.070 align:middle line:10%
to say these things that are
as crazy, that I have said

00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:53.500 align:middle line:10%
not to a lot of
people, because who

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:55.540 align:middle line:10%
I talk to is so constricted.

00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:57.220 align:middle line:10%
And it's always
constricted by what

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.350 align:middle line:10%
I know they want to talk about.

00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's a few
people now that have--

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.190 align:middle line:90%
and you let me off the leash.

00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:04.430 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm so glad we did.

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: I hope the
neighbors don't call you

00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:08.530 align:middle line:84%
about that dog that's
been in your yard making

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:09.040 align:middle line:90%
a lot of noise.

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] I hope not.

00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:11.170 align:middle line:90%
But they may.

00:56:11.170 --> 00:56:11.970 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:12.860 align:middle line:90%
I'll deal with it.

00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:14.980 align:middle line:84%
So, Darryl, first of
all, what website or what

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.000 align:middle line:90%
are you doing now?

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.125 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: I have a website.

00:56:17.125 --> 00:56:20.420 align:middle line:84%
It's www.DRSchoon-- stands
for my initials, Darryl--

00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:21.220 align:middle line:90%
.com.

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHOON: And they can
sort of find me there.

00:56:22.810 --> 00:56:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:24.548 align:middle line:90%
We'll leave it at that.

00:56:24.548 --> 00:56:26.748 align:middle line:84%
And we can also tell
people to go elsewhere,

00:56:26.748 --> 00:56:29.290 align:middle line:84%
which I'll do in just a moment
to get your book and so forth.

00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Darryl, what a
heartfelt experience.

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:32.440 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can say.

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And off camera, we found out
we've lived all over, all over

00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:36.490 align:middle line:90%
in the same places.

00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:37.523 align:middle line:90%
It's just weird, really.

00:56:37.523 --> 00:56:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: It is weird.

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I feel a wonderful
kind of connection with you,

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:41.930 align:middle line:90%
but also respect.

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Mm.

00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you,
until we meet again.

00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:44.860 align:middle line:90%
And we will.

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHOON: Thank you.

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:47.950 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You can find
"The Time of the Vulture"

00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:50.830 align:middle line:10%
and all of Darryl's other books
through major booksellers.

00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:52.423 align:middle line:10%
And you can also
go to his website.

00:56:52.423 --> 00:56:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:56.140 align:middle line:90%
