00:00:27.702 --> 00:00:30.160 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: One of the
great frustrations many of us

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.610 align:middle line:10%
have is that we feel our
government representatives turn

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.950 align:middle line:10%
a blind eye while Wall
Street robs us blind.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.870 align:middle line:84%
But there are, in
fact, aware people

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:84%
at the top of the
political spectrum who

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:90%
are paying attention.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Former Canadian defense
minister Paul Hellyer

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.150 align:middle line:84%
has been keeping an
eye on the money mafia

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:90%
throughout his life and career.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.810 align:middle line:84%
I caught up with
him in Los Angeles

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.540 align:middle line:84%
to learn just how deep
the corruption goes

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and what's required of us
to take back our system.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Paul, we're back, and we could
not end the conversation.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.110 align:middle line:84%
You brought up a couple juicy
pearls in your background

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.069 align:middle line:84%
in economics and your
book, "The Money Mafia."

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.410 align:middle line:84%
I really wanted to have
this conversation with you

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.380 align:middle line:84%
because we are a slave
species, but not in the way

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.370 align:middle line:90%
that some of the people mean.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.900 align:middle line:84%
We're a slave species to a
horrid economic system that has

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.309 align:middle line:90%
been artificially constructed.

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL HELLYER:
We're slaves to debt.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're slaves to debt.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm going to start it out.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And in your book,
you make this comment

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.790 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of
one of the chapters,

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:84%
that you always kept
an eye on the mafia

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.310 align:middle line:90%
throughout your career.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.780 align:middle line:84%
You kind of needed to
know what they were up to.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's start the
conversation there.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.845 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:36.645 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Why?

00:01:36.645 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Because they have a way of
compromising politicians.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.890 align:middle line:10%
>>HELLYER: They will contribute
to your campaign funds,

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:10%
just normally.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And unless you know who
they are and what they are,

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.040 align:middle line:90%
you won't even know about it.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And maybe eventually, years
later, you might find out.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.466 align:middle line:84%
Or there might be some
request, something like that.

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And I've had personal
experience when

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I was dabbling with a little
private political party at one

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.860 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.940 align:middle line:90%
I got a check for $5,000.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And it came with a
letter that said,

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.076 align:middle line:84%
there's more where
this came from.

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Being a little bit suspicious,
I thought to myself,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.520 align:middle line:90%
I wonder what that's all about.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So I got in touch
with the editor

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:84%
of our major paper,
the "Toronto Star,"

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and asked if he could
give me any leads.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.710 align:middle line:84%
About two weeks
later, he wrote back

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
and he said, yes, that's the
lawyer for the number one mafia

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.140 align:middle line:90%
guy in the Hamilton area.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.144 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:02:48.144 --> 00:02:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you started
learning about shadow

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.040 align:middle line:90%
operations early on.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Right.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So the check went
back, despite the fact

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.505 align:middle line:84%
that it would have been
very useful at the time.

00:02:59.505 --> 00:03:02.690 align:middle line:84%
No, it's just something
to keep track of.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: So I--

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
was the beginning

00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:08.660 align:middle line:84%
of looking at shadow
effects of money.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And I have a question, and I
don't know if it's relevant

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.910 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Having looked at that and
watched how that works--

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and we know, just mostly
through fictionalized accounts

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and some news, how those
kinds of cartels work.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.130 align:middle line:84%
But let's now start
dovetailing that

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:84%
into how the cartel at
large is working now,

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and the similarities between the
mafia and the current cartels.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Well, most
people, first of all,

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.470 align:middle line:90%
don't know what money is.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.990 align:middle line:90%
And so let's start there.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.055 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: The change you have
in your pocket or in your purse

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:45.530 align:middle line:90%
is less than 1%.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.360 align:middle line:90%
Just change.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.410 align:middle line:84%
The bills you carry in your
pocketbook or purse and so on,

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:84%
or have stashed around, are,
depending on circumstances,

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.820 align:middle line:90%
maybe 3% of money.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.780 align:middle line:90%
All the rest are bank deposits.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.290 align:middle line:90%
It is virtual money.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.980 align:middle line:90%
It is not real money.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.430 align:middle line:84%
It is not legal tender,
although it is used

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:90%
as if it were legal tender.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:23.030 align:middle line:84%
It is a global fraud, F-R-A-U-D.
And it's a Ponzi scheme worse

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.940 align:middle line:84%
than Bernie Madoff's in the
sense that it has affected tens

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.330 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of people
all over the world,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and wrecked their lives, and
wrecked their businesses.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And it is because
all of that money

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:49.150 align:middle line:84%
is created as debt, which has
to be repaid with interest.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.280 align:middle line:84%
But nobody creates
any money with which

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.990 align:middle line:84%
to repay either
principal or interest.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't take you long
to figure out what to do.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.950 align:middle line:84%
You have to borrow more in order
to pay the interest on what

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.120 align:middle line:90%
you already know.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.935 align:middle line:84%
Now, the sort of relationship
to the mafia that I

00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:14.450 align:middle line:84%
have in my book is that we
have had an investigation

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.200 align:middle line:84%
in our city of
Montreal in Canada.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was brought into the
evidence-- the allegation,

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.070 align:middle line:84%
at least-- that the mafia had
been creaming off 2% or 2.5%

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.670 align:middle line:84%
of all the contracts for public
works in the city for years.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:42.120 align:middle line:84%
The bankers only need $0.05
to create $1 in money that

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.000 align:middle line:90%
has to be repaid with interest.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're skimming 95%.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.125 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: 95% off
the top of every loan

00:05:50.125 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:90%
that people take out.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a mortgage,
or a loan for a car,

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.800 align:middle line:84%
or to start a business, or to
expand a business, or whatever,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:90%
95% off the top.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So that is why you have
these absolutely enormous

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:22.400 align:middle line:84%
wealthy people, where now 80
families own more than 50%

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.930 align:middle line:84%
of the whole wealth
of the world.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's getting
worse all the time.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.855 align:middle line:84%
A year ago, I think
it was 88 families.

00:06:30.855 --> 00:06:32.105 align:middle line:90%
This is part of globalization.

00:06:32.105 --> 00:06:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Becoming
more concentrated, yes.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Yeah, part
of globalization.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.053 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: But it is
basically the banking system,

00:06:37.053 --> 00:06:41.400 align:middle line:84%
because they're buying up
assets all over the world

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.650 align:middle line:90%
for $0.05 on the dollar.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.866 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And if
you can do that,

00:06:44.866 --> 00:06:48.910 align:middle line:84%
you can become immensely
wealthy in no time flat.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:49.840 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly--

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.256 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and it's something

00:06:51.256 --> 00:06:52.445 align:middle line:90%
they gifted themselves.

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Well, of course.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:59.250 align:middle line:84%
But politicians, kings,
queens, princes, presidents,

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.880 align:middle line:90%
and others, have consented.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Because the difference between
Bernie Madoff and the bankers

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.580 align:middle line:84%
is that the banks'
stealing is legal.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: But there is
legislation that allows

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.440 align:middle line:90%
them to do what they're doing.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the problem is to
change the legislation

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.250 align:middle line:90%
and to have a fairer system.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And as of now, what
needs to be done,

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:37.910 align:middle line:84%
of course, because the
world is drowning in debt--

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.630 align:middle line:84%
the debt situation at the moment
is the worst it has ever been,

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.150 align:middle line:84%
I think in the
history of the world.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's getting worse
instead of better.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.210 align:middle line:84%
So what has to be
done is the infusion

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.150 align:middle line:84%
of-- some days I use
"significant amounts."

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Other days I say
"massive amounts"

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle line:84%
of government-created, debt-free
money to make the whole mix,

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:18.660 align:middle line:84%
to change it, to add a
different kind of money which

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.490 align:middle line:84%
will allow the system to work
without having to go back

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.690 align:middle line:90%
to the bankers and borrow.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing is,
the people own the rights.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.305 align:middle line:90%
In Canada, we own them outright.

00:08:33.305 --> 00:08:35.189 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You own what outright?

00:08:35.189 --> 00:08:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: The right
to create money.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: 100% of it.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.929 align:middle line:90%
I'm not suggesting 100%.

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in my book and
one or two recent books,

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:50.430 align:middle line:90%
I have promoted the idea of 34%.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:55.375 align:middle line:84%
And that would be enough,
A, to reduce the leverage--

00:08:55.375 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and we haven't talked about
leverage, but maybe we should--

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:84%
from 20 to 1, which is creaming
95% off the top, to 2 to 1,

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.610 align:middle line:90%
which is having to put up 50%.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's still a good deal.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:16.820 align:middle line:84%
But the banking industry
can play a role, still,

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.710 align:middle line:84%
providing a little
credit to new businesses

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:90%
and this sort of thing.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
that we can leave them

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.400 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit of
money-creation power, which

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:35.550 align:middle line:84%
is positive, but not with this
system where they can just

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:90%
take it all.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.645 align:middle line:84%
And now they have a
monopoly in creating money.

00:09:39.645 --> 00:09:41.635 align:middle line:90%
And the monopoly must end.

00:09:41.635 --> 00:09:43.670 align:middle line:90%
It must end right away.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And governments have to
start creating enough money

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:84%
to balance their books,
to balance their budgets,

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:84%
and to meet the real
needs of the people

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.740 align:middle line:90%
at reasonable tax rates.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.610 align:middle line:90%
That's what has to be done.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And you have a special
problem in the United States

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.680 align:middle line:84%
of major proportions,
unfortunately,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:11.120 align:middle line:84%
that you have this monster, the
Federal Reserve system, around.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, for anyone
to-- just because we

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.150 align:middle line:90%
can't get into all of it.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.940 align:middle line:84%
But they can go to
"Creature from Jekyll

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.330 align:middle line:90%
Island," for example, and--

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:21.413 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Oh, absolutely.

00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:24.209 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, Griffin's
site, and get the book

00:10:24.209 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:84%
and start educating
yourself on that.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.651 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Or "The Web of Debt."

00:10:27.651 --> 00:10:29.275 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "Web of
Debt" by Ellen Brown.

00:10:29.275 --> 00:10:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And I've done some interviews
with her too, so there's--

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And you just have to
read the first hundred pages.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Including
how Morgan Bank

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.480 align:middle line:84%
gained control of the
press so that they wouldn't

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.260 align:middle line:90%
talk about these issues.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Sending people out.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.020 align:middle line:84%
What are the most
important papers?

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.270 align:middle line:90%
Well, here they are.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Get control of the 25 most
important papers in the United

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.370 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.690 align:middle line:84%
They will never mention
our creaming them.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.311 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Because
we won't let them.

00:10:58.311 --> 00:11:00.740 align:middle line:84%
It's the same kind of
secrecy that actually

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:90%
applies in the UFO field.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: So that
nothing gets in the paper,

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:12.760 align:middle line:84%
because there is an
embargo on those issues.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And probably it
is done exactly the same way

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.670 align:middle line:84%
as Morgan Bank did a
little over 100 years ago,

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.710 align:middle line:90%
when the Fed was formed.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we're going
to backtrack because I

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.060 align:middle line:84%
want to get into
the anatomy of this

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.720 align:middle line:84%
and how a lot of the trouble
we're in today began.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:37.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back into pre-World
War II, back through IG Farben,

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Nazis, Bank of
International Settlements,

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and do a little anatomy of
war equals debt equals profit.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.365 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Well, yeah.

00:11:46.365 --> 00:11:47.430 align:middle line:90%
Anything that--

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we have
wars going constantly.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.660 align:middle line:90%
It's for a reason.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.326 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Where you
have any borrowing,

00:11:52.326 --> 00:11:56.950 align:middle line:84%
which you have to have in war,
then that's good for the banks

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:84%
and bad for the people, because
they're left with the debt.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:05.840 align:middle line:84%
The people that make the
munitions make a lot of money.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.050 align:middle line:90%
The banks make a lot of money.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.590 align:middle line:84%
A lot of ordinary
people get killed.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Their families' lives
are disrupted, and so on.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And they are left
with the debt, which

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.420 align:middle line:84%
they have to pay,
and not only repay

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.570 align:middle line:90%
principal, but also interest.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Which they can't do, because
there's no money with which

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.720 align:middle line:90%
to repay it.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So it just keeps getting
larger and larger and larger.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And you folks in
the United States

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.830 align:middle line:84%
have this charade that
you have to go through

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.500 align:middle line:84%
every once in a while to
increase the credit limit.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.970 align:middle line:90%
[REGINA SNORTING]

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Whereas it would not
be necessary at all

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.890 align:middle line:84%
if we had a system that
was the least bit sensible,

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:48.310 align:middle line:84%
because the federal government
could create enough money

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.330 align:middle line:90%
to balance its budget.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:84%
An important point
is that people

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.530 align:middle line:84%
say you have to live
within your means.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, we, as individuals, do.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And state
governments do.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.980 align:middle line:90%
And municipalities have to.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:84%
But federal governments
don't because they

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.670 align:middle line:90%
own the patent to create money.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And we have a proposal
in Canada that's

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:84%
been talked about of creating
cash by instead of giving out

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:30.300 align:middle line:84%
bonds to borrow money, that
they create share certificates

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.210 align:middle line:84%
in the country, just
in nominal amounts

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.280 align:middle line:90%
of so many billions of dollars.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Hand them to the
central bank in exchange

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.370 align:middle line:84%
for cash, which
is then deposited

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.260 align:middle line:90%
in the government's accounts.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And in Canada, we're suggesting
a certain amount, $150 billion

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.872 align:middle line:84%
a year for seven years,
and split equally

00:13:51.872 --> 00:13:54.455 align:middle line:84%
between the federal government
and the provincial governments.

00:13:54.455 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:84%
So we'd share it with
the municipalities.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And this would be
enough for everyone

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.250 align:middle line:90%
to balance their books.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sounds
totally rational.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Absolutely
totally rational.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, the
economy would take off.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And the despair of the
present young generation,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.950 align:middle line:84%
who quote unquote
"are not going to

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.460 align:middle line:84%
do as well as their parents"
because of the system--

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.084 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
left holding the bag.

00:14:18.084 --> 00:14:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.870 align:middle line:90%
They will have renewed hope.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.440 align:middle line:90%
So easy.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.250 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
is it's too easy,

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and the other that money
mafia have too much power

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and are willing to grease
the palms of people

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.320 align:middle line:84%
that will support them
one way or another.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.070 align:middle line:90%
But something has to change.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.155 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise--

00:14:39.155 --> 00:14:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I've been reading
several papers recently,

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.530 align:middle line:84%
who say there will probably
be another recession

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.230 align:middle line:90%
within the next two years.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And then some people say,
maybe three or four years.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't need any
more recessions.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.685 align:middle line:84%
Heavenly days, I
forget how many there

00:14:55.685 --> 00:15:01.370 align:middle line:84%
have been in the last 100 years,
but 30, or something like that?

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
theoretically they can't do

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:06.170 align:middle line:90%
what they've done in the past.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So the quantitative easing,
people are kind of on to that.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.937 align:middle line:90%
There's no easing of anything.

00:15:10.937 --> 00:15:12.270 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to ease it with.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Well--

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.208 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Under the current--

00:15:14.208 --> 00:15:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Quantitative easing
was liquidity for the banks,

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.200 align:middle line:90%
not for the people.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not for the people.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:20.596 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: No.

00:15:20.596 --> 00:15:21.396 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:15:21.396 --> 00:15:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And they created
trillions of dollars

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.240 align:middle line:84%
to bail out the banks
and some businesses,

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.830 align:middle line:84%
who were the friends of the
shareholders of the Fed.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Because the Fed is a
private corporation.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: It's not
government-owned,

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.100 align:middle line:90%
as we have in Canada.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And this was a big mistake made
a little over 100 years ago.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.783 align:middle line:90%
Everybody recognized it.

00:15:44.783 --> 00:15:47.355 align:middle line:84%
But in 100 years, Congress
hasn't done anything about it.

00:15:47.355 --> 00:15:48.155 align:middle line:90%
Long since--

00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, "Creature
from Jekyll Island," read it.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Long since time to
come to terms with it

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and do something
so that you regain

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
control of the most important
economic tool in the toolbox.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, so in your book,
as you were explaining

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.707 align:middle line:84%
how, along the way,
how this played out,

00:16:08.707 --> 00:16:10.540 align:middle line:84%
one of the things I
found really interesting

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.956 align:middle line:84%
was an area where
you were talking

00:16:11.956 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:84%
about the Bank of
International Settlements--

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.660 align:middle line:84%
this was pre-World
War II-- and the fact

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.510 align:middle line:84%
that there were agreements
made between governments,

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:25.730 align:middle line:84%
for example, that we were not
to bomb the IG Farben factories.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:84%
You had a lot of vehicles
being produced out of there.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Ford produced a lot of the
vehicles for the Nazi effort,

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.750 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And that it was agreed
upon because it was already

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.400 align:middle line:84%
agreed that at the
conclusion of World War II,

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:44.920 align:middle line:84%
if I'm understanding what
you said in there correctly,

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.510 align:middle line:84%
the industry of
Germany was going

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:49.440 align:middle line:84%
to be used to help
rebuild after the war,

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.870 align:middle line:90%
so please spare those factories.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.870 align:middle line:84%
How far in advance is all
this stuff planned out?

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.547 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Wouldn't
it be nice to know?

00:16:57.547 --> 00:16:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, that was
all known before the war even

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.510 align:middle line:90%
started.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.093 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: But there
was collaboration

00:17:02.093 --> 00:17:06.210 align:middle line:84%
between the United States,
and industry, and the Nazis.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:07.849 align:middle line:84%
The Bank for
International settlement

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:13.180 align:middle line:84%
was almost in the
pockets of the Nazis.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.109 align:middle line:84%
And it has a very
bad reputation,

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:21.619 align:middle line:84%
and was supposed to have
been wound up after the war.

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:23.730 align:middle line:84%
But it had some
friends in court,

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:27.270 align:middle line:84%
and one way or another,
managed to escape.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And then it has become
sort of the regulator--

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:36.050 align:middle line:84%
it is a regulator--
of the banking system.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones
that set the rules that

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:45.265 align:middle line:84%
say that the banks can use
$0.05 to create a dollar.

00:17:45.265 --> 00:17:46.065 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And I just think it's
really important for people

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.830 align:middle line:84%
to grokk the fact
that all of this

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:84%
is happening behind
the scenes to engineer

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.100 align:middle line:84%
certain people to rise
to power-- like Hitler,

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.150 align:middle line:84%
for example--
certain end scenarios

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:05.750 align:middle line:84%
so that certain other
companies and corporations

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.970 align:middle line:84%
within the
military-industrial complex

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.220 align:middle line:84%
will continue prospering through
the whole process and beyond,

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.000 align:middle line:84%
to say nothing of the banking
industry, the Warburgs,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.900 align:middle line:84%
for example, being really
central to that theme.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you ever--
I mean, it's controversial,

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.660 align:middle line:84%
but there is a little
book that was written

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.410 align:middle line:84%
called "The Secret
Backers of Hitler,"

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:26.480 align:middle line:84%
for example, that was supposedly
an end-of-life confessional

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.350 align:middle line:84%
by one of the Warburgs,
saying, he-- he spoke German.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.790 align:middle line:90%
He was from Germany.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And he was actually
doing the business

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.810 align:middle line:84%
of running the checks
between the Wall Street

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:84%
bankers and Hitler, to help
get him up and running.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Many of the families-- who
were Jewish, by the way.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.320 align:middle line:84%
So there was this
whole thing where

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.630 align:middle line:84%
money transcends all of
these other lines and issues.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:50.830 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter who suffers
at the end in the name of money.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.060 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:52.060 --> 00:19:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: It's an
insidious and evil system.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: I don't
often use that word.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:84%
My wife insists that I say that
the people responsible for it,

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.837 align:middle line:84%
there are evil consequences
of their actions.

00:19:13.837 --> 00:19:15.670 align:middle line:84%
So let's give them the
benefit of the doubt.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:90%
We can't get inside their minds.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.740 align:middle line:84%
But the system is
evil because it

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:27.980 align:middle line:84%
is making debt slaves of just
about everybody in the world.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's creating a class of
very, very, very rich people.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:37.680 align:middle line:84%
You read about it in the
papers periodically now,

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.510 align:middle line:90%
the pyramid of wealth.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:84%
When you get to the very top,
people with so much money,

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.860 align:middle line:84%
they don't even
put in the figures.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got
the multi-billionaires.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
widening base of us.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.623 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And then you get
the multi-multimillionaires,

00:19:53.623 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.330 align:middle line:90%
And then you get down.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
1% of the people

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.325 align:middle line:84%
are going to have
more money than all

00:20:04.325 --> 00:20:09.504 align:middle line:84%
of the people of the rest
of the world put together.

00:20:09.504 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:90%
And that's not good.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one of the
things-- when globalization

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:22.090 align:middle line:84%
came along, they
admitted that it

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:26.790 align:middle line:84%
was going to have some
problems of redistribution.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.477 align:middle line:84%
But no one said what
the cure might be.

00:20:30.477 --> 00:20:32.060 align:middle line:84%
They kept writing,
saying, well, there

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:84%
are some problems
we have to work out

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.450 align:middle line:84%
about the redistribution
of wealth.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there's too much
money flowing to certain people.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.700 align:middle line:84%
But I never read an
article that said,

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.475 align:middle line:90%
and the cure to this problem is.

00:20:45.475 --> 00:20:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're right.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:46.940 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:47.981 align:middle line:90%
You don't see that story.

00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, this brings us
to another topic,

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:56.220 align:middle line:84%
which ameliorates a lot
of the effects of poverty,

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:84%
for example, around the
world on many levels.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with
our energy sources.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And as you've said in your book,
the banking industry, number

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:07.930 align:middle line:84%
one at the top of
this very sick system.

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.200 align:middle line:90%
Next under that is oil.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Mm-hmm.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And breaking
the oil cartels,

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.510 align:middle line:84%
when I know for at
least the last 15 years

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:84%
that I've been doing
this, you read about.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:22.190 align:middle line:84%
You run into an inventor
here and there saying,

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:25.342 align:middle line:84%
I've got this little prototype,
and well on their way.

00:21:25.342 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at
what happened out

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.170 align:middle line:84%
of Roswell, from our
last conversation,

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:32.990 align:middle line:84%
we're absolutely on our way to
being able to eliminate the oil

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:34.070 align:middle line:90%
industry.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.160 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about it.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:42.332 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: In my book, I
say, our house is on fire.

00:21:42.332 --> 00:21:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're not doing
anything about it.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I wrote "The Light
at the End of the Tunnel,"

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.880 align:middle line:90%
I said we had 10 years.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:84%
When I wrote "The Money Mafia,
a World in Crisis," I said,

00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:00.940 align:middle line:84%
we have seven years to
change the power source

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:08.730 align:middle line:84%
in every car, truck,
train, boat, airplane,

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:11.334 align:middle line:90%
and home in the world.

00:22:11.334 --> 00:22:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which can be done.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Which is possible.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: All we have to do
is what we did in World War II.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.730 align:middle line:90%
And I remember it well.

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:25.100 align:middle line:84%
It's the advantage
of being over 39.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Barely.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.690 align:middle line:90%
With rosy, perfect skin still.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Correct.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:29.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:36.000 align:middle line:10%
So what we did, we took
all of the car companies

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.590 align:middle line:10%
and refrigerator companies
and washing machine companies

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:42.540 align:middle line:10%
and transferred them
into armaments companies.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:47.480 align:middle line:84%
They were making tanks
and trucks and munitions.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.592 align:middle line:84%
Now we just have
to do the opposite

00:22:49.592 --> 00:22:53.705 align:middle line:84%
and take all these
armaments companies, who

00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:56.300 align:middle line:84%
are providing the ammunition
to keep the wars going

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:00.030 align:middle line:84%
in the Middle East, and
the insurrections and all

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.460 align:middle line:84%
of the other things,
and transfer them

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:08.780 align:middle line:84%
into producing
zero-point energy boxes,

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.700 align:middle line:90%
and then installing them.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, problem-- where are
they going to get the money?

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And they're only going
to have the money

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:23.950 align:middle line:84%
to do it, nation-states, if they
start producing that free money

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:25.770 align:middle line:90%
in copious amounts.

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:28.331 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because there is quite
a cost involved in switching

00:23:28.331 --> 00:23:30.080 align:middle line:84%
over from the old way
and the technology--

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.663 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: It's going
to be expensive.

00:23:31.663 --> 00:23:35.000 align:middle line:84%
It's going to cost
trillions of dollars.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to, at
the same time-- and one

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.642 align:middle line:84%
of the excuses given for
not doing it is that it's

00:23:40.642 --> 00:23:41.600 align:middle line:90%
going to be disruptive.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Of course it's going
to be disruptive.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.555 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's hope.

00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: But it's going
to create billions of jobs,

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:84%
making all of these boxes
and installing them,

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.715 align:middle line:84%
and then changing
the infrastructure

00:23:52.715 --> 00:23:54.510 align:middle line:84%
and getting rid of
the wires that we

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:59.670 align:middle line:84%
use to transport electricity
miles across the landscape,

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:01.480 align:middle line:84%
despoiling the
landscape and so on.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So economically, it would be
a plus rather than a minus.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing missing--
well, there are two things.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.080 align:middle line:84%
One, the United States
is going to have

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.670 align:middle line:90%
to make the technology public.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Because the Cabal control it.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.520 align:middle line:84%
They've been ruthless
about keeping it

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:84%
from getting into
the public domain.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And the president, by
presidential decree,

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.420 align:middle line:84%
is going to have
to make it public.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, once it
is public, we're

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.190 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
start converting

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.160 align:middle line:84%
armaments companies
and other manufacturing

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:44.190 align:middle line:84%
companies into the manufacture
of these small boxes, which

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:48.000 align:middle line:84%
are described in the Serpo
expedition, for example.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.229 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And
then install them.

00:24:51.229 --> 00:24:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
was from the '60s.

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's remind people,
that was from the '60s.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:55.895 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Yeah,
absolutely, the '60s.

00:24:55.895 --> 00:24:56.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And one
of the people who

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:05.580 align:middle line:84%
worked in Area 51 and
S4, the late Dr. Wolf,

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.630 align:middle line:84%
said that they had
developed-- again,

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:13.740 align:middle line:84%
going back the '60s-- both cold
fusion and zero-point energy.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
again the press,

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.330 align:middle line:84%
being owned by whoever
they're owned by,

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:20.600 align:middle line:90%
crucified cold fusion.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Absolutely.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.690 align:middle line:90%
So this has to be done.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And it must be done if we
are going to save our planet.

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:32.980 align:middle line:84%
But we have all of
these people acting

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.570 align:middle line:84%
as if this is a problem
you can worry about 30

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:40.820 align:middle line:84%
or 40 or 50 years from
now, when it's too late.

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And how do we get that
message out to the people?

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah,
that's one of the things I

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:48.850 align:middle line:90%
wanted to talk to you about.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.150 align:middle line:90%
Because you do have a plan.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:54.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've thought all
this through very well.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can go on
and keep hammering away

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.260 align:middle line:90%
on what happened back then.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.390 align:middle line:84%
I only brought up the
World War II aspect of this

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:05.030 align:middle line:84%
to show that all these
things were premeditated--

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.730 align:middle line:84%
very unlikely and ugly
bedfellows-- to create

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:11.020 align:middle line:90%
what became Nazi Germany.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And after Nazi Germany,
that didn't go away.

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:19.770 align:middle line:84%
The brain trust of that was
essentially preserved and moved

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:22.580 align:middle line:84%
forward into our
culture in America.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.035 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little bit
about that and how it--

00:26:26.035 --> 00:26:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Yeah,
Operation Paperclip.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: A lot of
German scientists

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:36.670 align:middle line:84%
were brought over at
the end of the war.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And President Truman
said, don't bring them

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.890 align:middle line:84%
if they were close
to the Nazi Party.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:45.320 align:middle line:84%
The military, being
the military--

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.945 align:middle line:84%
and I know them
reasonably well, as you

00:26:46.945 --> 00:26:50.140 align:middle line:84%
can guess-- didn't pay any
attention to the president.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.900 align:middle line:90%
They brought them anyway.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And some of them had been
really hardcore Nazis.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to
wonder if they didn't

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.060 align:middle line:84%
bring some of their
ideology with them

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps meld it with
people in the United States

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:13.930 align:middle line:84%
who were sympathetic to
that form of government,

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.895 align:middle line:84%
because there were some
prior to World War II

00:27:16.895 --> 00:27:19.220 align:middle line:90%
and during World War II.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And how strong this
force is, I have no idea.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:29.570 align:middle line:84%
But I do know what
the New World Order--

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:32.384 align:middle line:90%
it's even the same words--

00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:33.425 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The same motto.

00:27:33.425 --> 00:27:35.133 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: --that the
Germans were using.

00:27:35.133 --> 00:27:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it has certainly
fed into the perpetuation

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:41.179 align:middle line:90%
of perpetual war.

00:27:41.179 --> 00:27:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Perpetual war.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To feed the
banksters, the money mafia.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Right.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.096 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To keep us in
the position we're in.

00:27:47.096 --> 00:27:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Also the
idea of a superior race.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Which is, as
you know, in the works

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.690 align:middle line:84%
again with
cross-breeding and so on.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:04.159 align:middle line:84%
And they're talking about
population reduction.

00:28:04.159 --> 00:28:05.450 align:middle line:90%
And who's going to get reduced?

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.971 align:middle line:90%


00:28:07.971 --> 00:28:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Ooh, that gets into
some really interesting areas,

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:13.360 align:middle line:84%
especially when you talk about
the Google boys, and the Google

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.110 align:middle line:84%
wives, and 23andMe,
and people saying,

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:18.650 align:middle line:84%
oh, I want to know if I
have a propensity toward, I

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:19.770 align:middle line:90%
don't know, sneezing.

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:23.880 align:middle line:84%
So here, you have all
my DNA information.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.530 align:middle line:84%
We're willingly giving
up that information

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.580 align:middle line:84%
so that these genotypes
can be exploited, and even

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.660 align:middle line:84%
in the potential of
biological warfare.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Yeah.

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:36.960 align:middle line:90%
It is a precarious situation.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't talked
about chemtrails and--

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I have it
down here if you will.

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:42.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And HAARP
and what is really up.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Please, if you're
comfortable talking about it,

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.340 align:middle line:90%
I wish you would.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Well,
I'm not an expert.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking into-- this
is one of the things

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:90%
that I'm digging into now.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:01.285 align:middle line:84%
Because as a matter
of fact, the chap

00:29:01.285 --> 00:29:06.410 align:middle line:84%
who was kind enough to drive
me to Irvine for the UFO

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:12.700 align:middle line:84%
conference said that they were
finding aluminum in the sand.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And the allegation is
that the chemtrails-- I

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:22.870 align:middle line:84%
don't know if they're based in
coal ashes, as some people say.

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:27.820 align:middle line:84%
But they carry, allegedly,
nanoparticles of aluminum,

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and barium, and strontium,
and other things.

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:35.140 align:middle line:90%
And they are ingested.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And they go into the bloodstream
and follow the bloodstream

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:41.920 align:middle line:84%
right up to the
brain, and allegedly

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:47.040 align:middle line:84%
cause problems like early
senility, and Alzheimer's,

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.745 align:middle line:90%
and other forms of disease.

00:29:48.745 --> 00:29:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
carcinomic as well.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
network, I guess,

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:02.250 align:middle line:84%
provides a way of
killing anybody anywhere

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:05.100 align:middle line:90%
at any time in the world.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.239 align:middle line:90%
And geopolitics of--

00:30:06.239 --> 00:30:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
talking about HAARP.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: --being able
to cause earthquakes,

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:12.960 align:middle line:84%
snow in the summer and
rain in the winter,

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.750 align:middle line:90%
and all of these things.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And talk about things we
don't know and should know.

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:25.180 align:middle line:84%
There's another giant
area that should be

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.830 align:middle line:90%
exposed before it's too late.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And I have, over the last 10
years, and many others have,

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.920 align:middle line:90%
done pieces on this.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.610 align:middle line:84%
But again, we're talking to
a relatively small portion

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:36.720 align:middle line:90%
of the public.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Because once again,
the mainstream media

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:43.220 align:middle line:84%
suppresses any information
and then ridicules

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.610 align:middle line:90%
what already exists.

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:46.260 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard
to break through

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.620 align:middle line:84%
to the average person
that is attached

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:50.990 align:middle line:90%
to mainstream anything.

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: It is.

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:53.036 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
it's so difficult

00:30:53.036 --> 00:30:55.017 align:middle line:84%
to get the public
interested is because they

00:30:55.017 --> 00:30:56.850 align:middle line:84%
don't know the difference
between a contrail

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:58.470 align:middle line:90%
and a chemtrail.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was on this
beat for a while myself.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And in the morning, I was
calling the National Weather

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Service.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.830 align:middle line:84%
I was asking for moisture
content at elevations.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I was calling the
FAA and saying, well,

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:14.020 align:middle line:84%
what about this flying
overhead right now?

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.247 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we don't track that.

00:31:16.247 --> 00:31:17.080 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you track?

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:17.880 align:middle line:90%
That's military.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.140 align:middle line:84%
We don't track that, the
ones that were laying--

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.337 align:middle line:84%
I went down that
rabbit hole very deeply

00:31:23.337 --> 00:31:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and came out with only one
thing on the other end,

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.660 align:middle line:90%
but it was important.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.130 align:middle line:84%
I finally reached
the head of the FAA,

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:32.210 align:middle line:84%
their public information
officer for the western US.

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And I said, is the reason you
and all of these other agents

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:37.677 align:middle line:84%
will not tell me
about any of this,

00:31:37.677 --> 00:31:39.510 align:middle line:84%
and tell me about these
planes laying trails

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.670 align:middle line:84%
right over here right
now, because this

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.210 align:middle line:90%
is a military operation?

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:44.642 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes.

00:31:44.642 --> 00:31:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And that was the end
of the conversation,

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:47.150 align:middle line:90%
but he admitted it.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:50.140 align:middle line:84%
He had to, in case he
was being recorded.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a military operation.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.140 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.230 align:middle line:84%
We know people and hair
samples in little kids

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:56.450 align:middle line:84%
are coming up with
aluminum in them,

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:59.010 align:middle line:84%
when there's no other
viable source of aluminum

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.540 align:middle line:90%
in their diets.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.450 align:middle line:84%
This is a weakening
of the immune system

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:03.020 align:middle line:90%
of the human species.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Exactly.

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so concerned
about these things.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:12.817 align:middle line:84%
I never carry pictures of my
children or my grandchildren.

00:32:12.817 --> 00:32:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just chemtrails.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: But I
carry a picture of

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:22.160 align:middle line:84%
my little great-granddaughter
to remind me why I'm fighting.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Because the air she breathes,
the water she drinks,

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and the soil where
her food will be grown

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:33.890 align:middle line:84%
is all being
poisoned by somebody.

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:37.825 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And they don't
have my permission to do that.

00:32:37.825 --> 00:32:40.500 align:middle line:90%
And they don't have hers.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.560 align:middle line:90%
So where do they get it?

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.030 align:middle line:90%
Where do they get the orders?

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:45.750 align:middle line:90%
Who is responsible for it?

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.305 align:middle line:90%
Who said they could do it?

00:32:47.305 --> 00:32:48.687 align:middle line:90%
And I think we should know that.

00:32:48.687 --> 00:32:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We should.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Now we just have a
few minutes left.

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the way
you see it lining up,

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.304 align:middle line:90%
because it all comes back on us.

00:32:57.304 --> 00:32:59.095 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we change
the banking structure,

00:32:59.095 --> 00:33:03.180 align:middle line:84%
it means that cheap
and easy credit may not

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.800 align:middle line:84%
be available to us to go
buy a thousand-dollar purse

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.580 align:middle line:84%
at the age of 15 that
you can't afford,

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.850 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be paying
back for years and years.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have been duped in to
the consumer consciousness that

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.800 align:middle line:90%
feeds this.

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about it from a
personal responsibility level

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:23.435 align:middle line:84%
forward, what we have to do
to start altering the system.

00:33:23.435 --> 00:33:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Well, we have
to understand leverage,

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.320 align:middle line:84%
where we started out
this conversation.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I usually go back to the
time when the Bank of England

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:38.530 align:middle line:84%
was chartered and the king was
fighting a war against France.

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:41.140 align:middle line:84%
He needed some more money
to replenish his supplies

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and build some new
ships and things.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.000 align:middle line:90%
His credit was no good.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.460 align:middle line:84%
So it was suggested
he start a bank.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:52.522 align:middle line:84%
And Parliament authorized
the Bank of England.

00:33:52.522 --> 00:33:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And rich people put in 1,200,000
pounds of gold and silver,

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.092 align:middle line:84%
and lent it all to
the king at 8%, which

00:34:00.092 --> 00:34:02.550 align:middle line:84%
was a pretty high interest rate
for a government-guaranteed

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:04.530 align:middle line:90%
loan.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:08.969 align:middle line:84%
So to show his appreciation,
the king said, well,

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:14.989 align:middle line:84%
you can now print-- P-R-I-N-T--
$1,200,000 in bank notes

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:17.699 align:middle line:84%
and lend them to your friends
at high interest rates.

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So in effect, they were allowed
to lend the same money twice.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.168 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Well,
in the early years

00:34:24.168 --> 00:34:27.040 align:middle line:84%
of the 20th century
in the United States,

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.360 align:middle line:84%
your federally-chartered
banks had

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.690 align:middle line:90%
to have gold reserves of 25%.

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So they were allowed to lend
the same money four times.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:42.690 align:middle line:84%
In my country, Canada,
when I was younger,

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:46.139 align:middle line:84%
the banks had to have
8% cash reserves.

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:48.679 align:middle line:90%


00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Which meant they could lend
the same money 12.5 times.

00:34:52.810 --> 00:35:00.380 align:middle line:84%
In 1991, our government
took off that requirement.

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And now they don't have
to have any cash reserve.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And when Milton
Friedman came along,

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:10.580 align:middle line:84%
we changed the system from cash
reserves to capital reserves.

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And the capital that
they have to have now,

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.910 align:middle line:84%
as we've been
talking about, is 5%

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:20.510 align:middle line:84%
in order to create a
dollar, or a pound,

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:22.820 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is
that's created.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And this system is
just so lopsided

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:35.000 align:middle line:84%
because all of the people in the
world, other than the bankers,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.340 align:middle line:90%
can't do that.

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:40.015 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't lend three
or four different people

00:35:40.015 --> 00:35:41.750 align:middle line:84%
the same money and
get away with it.

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: But the banks can.

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:45.580 align:middle line:90%
So we have to change the system.

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:47.410 align:middle line:90%
We have to change the rules.

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
that I'm suggesting

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:53.000 align:middle line:84%
that we reduce the
leverage over seven years,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.516 align:middle line:84%
because we want to have
a smooth transition.

00:35:56.516 --> 00:35:58.970 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my colleagues
would do things faster.

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, you're
going to disrupt markets.

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.870 align:middle line:84%
You're going to do all
sorts of crazy things

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.060 align:middle line:90%
that you can't perceive.

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.760 align:middle line:84%
We'll do it over
an extended period,

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and it'll be so smooth
that people will hardly

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.240 align:middle line:90%
know that it's happening.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Except that these very rich
people who are promoting things

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:21.230 align:middle line:84%
like the Trans-Pacific
Partnership,

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:24.860 align:middle line:84%
which is nothing but the biggest
power grab in the history

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:25.780 align:middle line:90%
of the world--

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Please explain
it in encapsulation

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:30.830 align:middle line:84%
form for us so we understand
what it is and why.

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: The
Trans-Pacific Partner

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:35.580 align:middle line:84%
is the United States
and Canada and a lot

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:40.390 align:middle line:84%
of countries around
the Pacific Rim

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:45.370 align:middle line:84%
taking power from the people and
transferring it to the Cabal,

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:50.140 align:middle line:84%
basically, to the banks and to
the transnational corporations,

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:55.332 align:middle line:84%
and taking it away from their
legislatures and their courts.

00:36:55.332 --> 00:36:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And it should be a
criminal offense.

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And yet
it's almost done.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:06.104 align:middle line:90%
And this is really tragic.

00:37:06.104 --> 00:37:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
slept through it.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.686 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Slept through it.

00:37:08.686 --> 00:37:12.430 align:middle line:84%
We're just waiting for these
to be signed and sealed.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:18.430 align:middle line:84%
But these are the
culmination of globalization,

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:22.770 align:middle line:84%
all in the direction of
a world government run by

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:29.060 align:middle line:84%
and for the elite people and
the bankers of this world.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And they've been working
at it since the 1940s,

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.550 align:middle line:90%
during the war period.

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Before the war was
even over, the Council

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.070 align:middle line:84%
on Foreign Relations said,
we're going to build an empire.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:48.320 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be bigger
than the German empire.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:53.320 align:middle line:84%
It's going to encompass those
lands, ours, all of America,

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.365 align:middle line:90%
Pacific Rim--

00:37:54.365 --> 00:37:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big vision.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Big fish.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to make this
empire look better and bigger

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:08.390 align:middle line:84%
than any other empire in
the history of the world.

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:09.540 align:middle line:90%
Wrong direction to go.

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As we were
talking about before,

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:14.290 align:middle line:84%
is there a direct
line between what

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:17.520 align:middle line:84%
happened in Roswell
those days, a direct line

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.540 align:middle line:84%
through to the money
mafia that we know today?

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: I would say
there is a direct line, yes.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:29.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a cabal which, in effect,
has taken over responsibility

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:32.360 align:middle line:90%
for the ET file.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And this cabal, as you know,
starts with the bankers,

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:39.460 align:middle line:90%
the banking cartel.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.945 align:middle line:90%
That's the apex.

00:38:40.945 --> 00:38:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Then the oil cartel, and then
the transnational corporations

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and the whole idea
of globalization,

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.190 align:middle line:90%
then the intelligence agencies.

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:57.226 align:middle line:84%
Many of them, but
especially the CIA,

00:38:57.226 --> 00:38:58.725 align:middle line:84%
are responsible for
a lot of things.

00:38:58.725 --> 00:39:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And the FBI and the
NSA and maybe the MI6

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:08.960 align:middle line:84%
helps them a little bit, and
the Mossad from time to time.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And then a huge chunk of
the American military.

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:14.810 align:middle line:90%
And they're all in it together.

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:21.240 align:middle line:84%
But the line goes right up
to the top elite people,

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.380 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps with
their connection

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:27.170 align:middle line:84%
even with some secret societies
that we're not aware of.

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So with our
few minutes remaining,

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:35.170 align:middle line:84%
what can we, the people, do to
now get some integrity, dignity

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:37.420 align:middle line:84%
back in our own lives,
to recover ourselves?

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's just assume-- let's
say we have political means.

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Maybe just quickly
delineate what

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:45.820 align:middle line:84%
those are, what tools
we have at our disposal,

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and then what we can
do personally now?

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Well,
I've been preaching

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.610 align:middle line:90%
for weeks and months and years.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:58.330 align:middle line:84%
If enough people put
pressure on politicians,

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:00.690 align:middle line:90%
something would happen.

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:03.165 align:middle line:84%
But there's only one thing
that politicians understand,

00:40:03.165 --> 00:40:05.980 align:middle line:90%
and that's pressure.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to
get reelected or not?

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And if they think they're not,
they'll change their minds.

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:13.490 align:middle line:90%
But as long--

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:15.997 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can they
legislate this problem away?

00:40:15.997 --> 00:40:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Well, they could drop
the Trans-Pacific Partnership

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and say, we will not go
for that because it's

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:23.370 align:middle line:90%
a violation of our constitution.

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:25.520 align:middle line:84%
At least in our country,
it would unilaterally

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:31.695 align:middle line:84%
change our constitution and take
away our basic banking rights.

00:40:31.695 --> 00:40:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And we would not be able
to do the things that I've

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:36.620 align:middle line:90%
been proposing in my books.

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:39.560 align:middle line:90%
And in my opinion, it's illegal.

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.130 align:middle line:90%
It's immoral.

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if the Supreme
Court would overrule it or not.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.270 align:middle line:84%
But certainly if
they go through,

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:48.250 align:middle line:84%
we'll have to try and
get the Supreme Court

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:49.940 align:middle line:90%
to take a look at it.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Because it just would be end of
the road for doing what we have

00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:04.760 align:middle line:84%
to do and should do in order
to set the world right for not

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.440 align:middle line:84%
just great-granddaughters but
granddaughters and daughters

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.240 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.494 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So use our ability to
still apply political pressure.

00:41:11.494 --> 00:41:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Absolutely.

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then from
there, what do we do?

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: Well, that means we
have to change our priorities.

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And even though
we're busy trying

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:24.620 align:middle line:84%
to pay the next month's
rent and so on, say,

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:29.400 align:middle line:84%
got to take a timeout to protect
my future rights as well.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.860 align:middle line:90%
So got to take an interest.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:36.225 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people don't vote.

00:41:36.225 --> 00:41:39.640 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't
care about voting.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:43.680 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
don't read anything

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:47.810 align:middle line:84%
on the subject that's
more substantial than they

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:54.870 align:middle line:84%
get in the controlled press,
or listen to anything that's

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:56.965 align:middle line:90%
contrary to the news reports.

00:41:56.965 --> 00:41:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLYER: And individual
responsibility.

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I remember Paul
Herr saying that.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Individual responsibility
is what we have to take.

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:10.260 align:middle line:90%
We have to change our own lives.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
take responsibility

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.302 align:middle line:84%
for changing the system for
the benefit of other people.

00:42:15.302 --> 00:42:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And do you
believe we can do that?

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: Theoretically, yes.

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Theoretically, I
believe in miracles.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.770 align:middle line:90%
I am not an oddsmaker.

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:30.980 align:middle line:84%
The odds are so far against
us because of the power,

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:38.160 align:middle line:84%
especially of the bankers and
the transnational corporations.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:45.030 align:middle line:10%
But as Yogi Berra said, it's
not over till it's over.

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:48.180 align:middle line:10%
So we got to keep
fighting and doing

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:52.370 align:middle line:10%
everything we can to see
if we can't get that home

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:56.860 align:middle line:10%
run, the loaded bases at
the end of the innings,

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.587 align:middle line:10%
and stop this nonsense
before it's too late.

00:42:59.587 --> 00:43:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Paul, I want
to thank you so much.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And again, people can
read "The Money Mafia."

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And it'll give the diagram of
how all of this came to be,

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and again, your action
plan at the end.

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you so much
for all the public service

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.090 align:middle line:84%
and the careful thought
and consideration.

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And once again, as you say,
a return to basic morality

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.464 align:middle line:90%
is what we need.

00:43:19.464 --> 00:43:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLYER: It's my pleasure.

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for giving me
the opportunity to sound off.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:26.790 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, the book
is titled "The Money Mafia,"

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:28.980 align:middle line:10%
and you can find it
in major booksellers.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:30.920 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.610 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:35.960 align:middle line:90%
