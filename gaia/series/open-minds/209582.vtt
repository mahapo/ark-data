00:00:09.332 --> 00:00:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I'd like
to ask a lot of questions

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.373 align:middle line:90%
about dream time.

00:00:13.373 --> 00:00:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: In
the asking, it is given.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Those parts of self that are
not keeping the body alive

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.110 align:middle line:84%
can leave the body and
have other experiences.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.370 align:middle line:84%
We are only encased in
this physical existence

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.600 align:middle line:84%
by permission, but we
are of no space and time.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Belief is the
barrier between you

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and your multidimensional
experiences.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it a little
bit painful to watch

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:90%
from the other side?

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's
a bit frustrating.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Theo's encouraged us before we
even put our feet on the floor

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, think of one
thing we're grateful for,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.680 align:middle line:84%
one thing we're proud
of ourselves for,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.630 align:middle line:90%
and the third thing that I do--

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.890 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have you ever had
the experience of tandem dreams

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.880 align:middle line:90%
with another person?

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle line:90%
How about sleep paralysis?

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And what about
out-of-body experiences?

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Sheila Gillette is
back with us today.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And Theo is going to explain
how each one of these

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.640 align:middle line:84%
work from a mechanical point
of view from their perspective.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.862 align:middle line:84%
And I really want to--
welcome again, Sheila.

00:01:21.862 --> 00:01:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Oh, Regina.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.390 align:middle line:84%
It's so good to
be with you again.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's always
wonderful being together.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.720 align:middle line:84%
I have to say that this is
something that has always

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.090 align:middle line:84%
interested me because
we read books about it,

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.110 align:middle line:84%
but they don't really
explain the mechanics.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
This aspect of
your being is gone.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you bring it back
into a bad way, improper way,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:84%
or too quickly, it can be
very harmful to your psyche,

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.420 align:middle line:84%
for example, or mess
your day up or whatnot.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.120 align:middle line:84%
What's actually going-- I've
always wondered about all these

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:84%
things and how you tell a
dream from another dimensional

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.740 align:middle line:90%
experience and hooking up to--

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.770 align:middle line:84%
everything I mentioned in the
open, I find it fascinating.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really excited to talk
to the Theo group about it,

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.520 align:middle line:84%
but you've had these
experiences for 40, 50 years.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I have had.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:19.210 align:middle line:10%
And when I started being the
trance channel that I am,

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.980 align:middle line:10%
I would get that paralysis.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.250 align:middle line:10%
And I would be laying
flat and my body,

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't be able
to move my body.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.153 align:middle line:84%
And that was part of
doing the work with Theo.

00:02:31.153 --> 00:02:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's scary though.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.570 align:middle line:84%
When it first happens, you
don't-- and a lot of people

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.790 align:middle line:84%
watching have had these
things happen and don't know

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.330 align:middle line:90%
what's happening to them.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.250 align:middle line:90%
So it's frightening.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.290 align:middle line:84%
We always are frightened of
what we don't understand.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It is.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.910 align:middle line:10%
And what I realized
and what I was told,

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:10%
it was the way of the
body protecting itself

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.770 align:middle line:10%
so it doesn't short circuit
in the nervous system

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.050 align:middle line:10%
because the nervous system
is our electrical system.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.250 align:middle line:90%
And we forget that we are--

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.576 align:middle line:84%
above everything else,
we're electrical beings.

00:03:02.576 --> 00:03:03.376 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:03:03.376 --> 00:03:04.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning,
that energy of our soul

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.180 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than our body.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And it extends out farther
than our physical body

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and it's connected to
our nervous system.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.865 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we can sense
when we're in a safe place.

00:03:26.865 --> 00:03:29.280 align:middle line:90%
We learn that from birth.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But yet when you
get into circles such as ours

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:84%
and the Gaia
community, people are

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.720 align:middle line:84%
very loose in talking
about, well, you

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.640 align:middle line:90%
have to be in your body.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.250 align:middle line:90%
And that isn't what that means.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.560 align:middle line:90%
This has multiple meanings.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And I know I've
played with it a bit

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.980 align:middle line:84%
and had some disastrous kind
of results that happened.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I thought we
need to get clarity on all this

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and build a proper
language around it.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I agree.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I agree because so many
people are opening up now.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And that's the
way of the world these days.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.030 align:middle line:90%
That's who we are.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:90%
We're spiritual beings.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.410 align:middle line:84%
We're souls having
a human experience.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And now we're really
waking up to life

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.430 align:middle line:84%
is happening through us
and for us, not to us.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.777 align:middle line:84%
And we are powerful,
creative beings.

00:04:19.777 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
going to be having

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.040 align:middle line:84%
a lot more of these
types of experiences

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:90%
that we've been talking about.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Absolutely.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.520 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so if we can
understand the mechanics of it,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:84%
then we can be at peace and
relax while these things are

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.640 align:middle line:90%
happening, I think, better.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Oh, yeah.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.868 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then I also
need some techniques.

00:04:34.868 --> 00:04:38.460 align:middle line:84%
For example, I'm hoping Theo
can share a technique or two

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.430 align:middle line:84%
on if you bungle it getting
back together in the morning

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:84%
from dream time,
snap back to flight

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.900 align:middle line:84%
me, snap back so fast that
I'm disoriented for hours.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.510 align:middle line:84%
I can't really-- I'm
dizzy and disoriented.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.340 align:middle line:90%
I can't get integrated.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.990 align:middle line:90%
How we can work with that.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.343 align:middle line:84%
And probably breath,
but we'll find out.

00:04:57.343 --> 00:04:59.010 align:middle line:84%
We'll see what Theo
has to say about it.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That would be good.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It reintegrate
because I think a lot of people

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.730 align:middle line:90%
have that issue as well.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It will
help all of us.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.215 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It will
help all of us.

00:05:05.215 --> 00:05:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So I have a whole list
of questions here.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Are you ready to let
Theo flow on through?

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I am.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Here we go.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:26.820 align:middle line:90%


00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It is the
beginning, is it not?

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, Theo, for
joining us on this today.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.310 align:middle line:84%
We have many, many
points of confusion

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.930 align:middle line:84%
on this planet of
what's happening

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.120 align:middle line:84%
between the various parts of our
being, the electrical system,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.380 align:middle line:84%
the physical body, the
astral body, the etheric, all

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.260 align:middle line:84%
these different causal,
all these different bodies.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.600 align:middle line:84%
All the books give
them different kinds

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:90%
of capacities and such.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.920 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, I don't
think we really understand

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.760 align:middle line:90%
how this works that well.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you wouldn't
mind, I'd like

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.900 align:middle line:84%
to ask a lot of questions
about dream time, dream

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.350 align:middle line:84%
time with others, going to other
dimensions, being out of body,

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and safety, and how we integrate
if we bungle it and so forth.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Are you OK with that?

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We are appreciative
of the opportunity to serve.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.827 align:middle line:90%
In the asking, it is given.

00:06:18.827 --> 00:06:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So let's start really
simply with when

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.920 align:middle line:84%
we go into dream
time, that place where

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:84%
we're no longer cognizant
and our body is sleeping yet

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:84%
we seem to be elsewhere, can you
tell us about what part of us

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.940 align:middle line:90%
is no longer--

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:84%
or if that part is no longer
connected to the body or maybe

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.270 align:middle line:84%
just by a tether,
and what's just

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.580 align:middle line:90%
random firing of the brain?

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Can you just explain the
architecture of dream time?

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Dream
time can be part

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:58.900 align:middle line:84%
of the brain releasing the
energy of the day, clearing,

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle line:84%
just like you would
clear your computer hard

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and software that can
be deleted if you would.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So some dreams are
those dreams which

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:19.740 align:middle line:84%
are just deleting energy that
it does not need to hold on to.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.830 align:middle line:84%
But then there are
other dream states,

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.110 align:middle line:84%
they are out-of-body
experience, they

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.970 align:middle line:84%
are flying dreams where the
soul can leave the body.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there's a tether.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is think
body and you're back in it.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.210 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to lose the body.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Many are fearful of that in
dream of flying or out-of-body

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.270 align:middle line:84%
experiences that they
would not get back.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:90%
They always will.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:57.630 align:middle line:84%
It allows the soul to be in
its multidimensional expression

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle line:84%
for higher learning with
teachers and other experiences

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.181 align:middle line:84%
that human bodies
are not available to.

00:08:09.181 --> 00:08:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain that,
that human bodies are not

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.620 align:middle line:90%
available to.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.420 align:middle line:90%
What stops us?

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: The density.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.930 align:middle line:90%
The density--

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The density
of the human--

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.500 align:middle line:84%
of the third dimension
or fourth dimension.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:26.200 align:middle line:90%
And so the soul is eternal.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth is one
choice of learning.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.230 align:middle line:90%
There are billions.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And so the soul can go in
and out of the body at will

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:43.169 align:middle line:84%
because as this evolving
consciousness is occurring,

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:47.340 align:middle line:84%
there's an awareness that
that's available to you.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you're leaving
the body and just have that

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.990 align:middle line:84%
little tether, and you're
going into another dimension

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:84%
of learning, is this often a
part of the dream time that

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.780 align:middle line:84%
can't be expressed or remembered
per se because it is quite

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.730 align:middle line:90%
different from our--

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.160 align:middle line:84%
kind of the architecture of
the reality around us here

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.330 align:middle line:90%
that we're familiar with?

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes, that's correct.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Because humans think
in their human minds

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:21.210 align:middle line:84%
conceptually of things that
it knows in picture form.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So if
we would say chair

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:29.280 align:middle line:84%
to you, what comes to mind
is not the word spelled out,

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.900 align:middle line:84%
it's the image of
a chair, isn't it?

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's true as one's
deciphering information,

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:42.090 align:middle line:84%
the mind is attaching
to what is known.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you do not know something
from your multidimensionality,

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:84%
then you would not have a
picture of it or think of it.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So a lot
of that teaching

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.210 align:middle line:84%
is something that our being
is, is being inculcated

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.550 align:middle line:84%
into our being, but
we're not necessarily

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.190 align:middle line:84%
going to have remembrances
or awarenesses of that.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Correct.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Now in dream time, deciphering
between what is a dream,

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.930 align:middle line:84%
maybe there isn't a
difference, and what

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:19.640 align:middle line:84%
is simply having another
dimensional experience where

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.410 align:middle line:84%
you're out and acting, and
meeting with, and doing,

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.620 align:middle line:84%
and fully aware in
another dimension,

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.140 align:middle line:84%
is there any difference
between those two?

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Not much.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What would be the
distinguishing difference?

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: The distinguishing
experience of it

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.070 align:middle line:90%
would be memory.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: A dream,
you'll remember

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.510 align:middle line:84%
or you will remember
parts of it.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:50.510 align:middle line:84%
But most often, when this
experience is happening,

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.250 align:middle line:84%
there is an
awareness that you're

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.960 align:middle line:84%
dreaming in which would be
called lucid dreaming, being

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.860 align:middle line:84%
in the dream conscious
of its occurrence,

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and that's
informational dreaming.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.760 align:middle line:90%
It could be prophetic.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.570 align:middle line:84%
It could be answering
a question for you

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:16.670 align:middle line:84%
that's been posed before
this sleep state in answer

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.770 align:middle line:90%
to what is asked.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:26.880 align:middle line:84%
So there are many ways to use
the dream time to inform you.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happens
when you and another person

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.590 align:middle line:84%
go into dream time, you see
each other in dream time?

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe two or three of you,
you recognize each other

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.070 align:middle line:84%
in dream time and you appear
to be working towards something

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:45.030 align:middle line:90%
in common during dream time.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Is that an agreement where
the souls have simply

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.560 align:middle line:84%
met up to work things through
in a less dense environment?

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's by
agreement, yes, this meeting.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because a lot of
times when people say, oh,

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I had this wild dream
and I was doing this,

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and I was this person
and everything,

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I'll get the sense that
you were with them.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:90%
You were with this other being.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:10.730 align:middle line:90%
You have met.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not just some
crazy, random firing

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.140 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that's
been concocted.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.190 align:middle line:84%
You are actually meeting with
this other being for purpose.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.280 align:middle line:84%
How would you say
to the audience--

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.220 align:middle line:84%
how would they know the
difference between those two?

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: How it feels.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:34.650 align:middle line:84%
It's important to not only think
of the vision or the dialogue,

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:38.190 align:middle line:84%
whatever you might be
receiving, but also

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:42.420 align:middle line:84%
most important is how
do you feel about it?

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:50.700 align:middle line:84%
For you may have a vision that
could be violent in context,

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.050 align:middle line:84%
but not feel violent at all
because the message that's

00:12:55.050 --> 00:13:00.150 align:middle line:84%
being given you is
something you need to know.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And so the feeling aspect
of it is informational.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you're involved
in an act of violence,

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.240 align:middle line:84%
that it's getting your attention
to teach you something.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.255 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Correct.

00:13:13.255 --> 00:13:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
can be in a situation

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.463 align:middle line:84%
where something is
happening that does

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:19.470 align:middle line:84%
feel quite threatening
emotionally and physically

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.070 align:middle line:90%
in that moment.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's
informational as well.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.220 align:middle line:84%
What's going on in
your environment?

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.100 align:middle line:90%
What's happening around you?

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Is it a message to you or
is it a message to another?

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:90%
I can bring by--

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have all
kinds of dreams.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.440 align:middle line:84%
I can bring a few in
by way to illustrate

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.990 align:middle line:84%
what's going on that I think
maybe other people have had.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.510 align:middle line:84%
In one dream, it
was the re-- that

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.600 align:middle line:84%
was the reentry from dream
time back to the body, kind

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.290 align:middle line:90%
of going through layers.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular
layer, it appeared

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.930 align:middle line:84%
to be the layer more
of an astral realm

00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:00.420 align:middle line:84%
where people who have passed
over but aren't settled yet

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.220 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And I ran into a
woman in that realm.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was much more gray and
not very vital in the colors.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted to
be acknowledged.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.560 align:middle line:84%
So I acknowledged her
in a really nice way,

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.940 align:middle line:90%
but she wanted to touch me.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And I said something
kind to her to stop

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.850 align:middle line:84%
any kind of physical
interaction between us

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:21.800 align:middle line:84%
because it felt to me
like I was actually

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.690 align:middle line:90%
in another place at that time.

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Do we pass through
different realms

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:84%
where we're encountering
these beings?

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You can
and know that you're

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:84%
in the awareness of
the multidimensionality

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.830 align:middle line:84%
for you are in a
multidimensional being.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Your soul is
multidimensional and eternal.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:52.920 align:middle line:84%
So you can be in other
dimensions with that awareness.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I read after
that, that if you do end up

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.240 align:middle line:84%
in that place where you do
feel that you're encountering

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.060 align:middle line:84%
some disincarnate entities
who are just kind of lost,

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.270 align:middle line:84%
they haven't settled
yet, it's important

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.640 align:middle line:84%
not to tangle up
physically, that that

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be a good idea.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.340 align:middle line:90%
That's what I had read.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.810 align:middle line:90%
What is your thought on that?

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Is there truth in that or not?

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.002 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: There's no harm.

00:15:16.002 --> 00:15:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No harm can happen.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's
the great sense

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.290 align:middle line:84%
that you could be
harmed in some way.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:22.090 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You cannot be
when you're in those other

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:24.730 align:middle line:90%
dimensions.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And
nothing, no one, not

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:32.410 align:middle line:84%
anyone can do anything
with you or to you

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.400 align:middle line:90%
without your permission.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this-- yes,
very important to remember.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:41.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, what about what we call
out-of-body experiences?

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at how that
differs from what we've

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.440 align:middle line:90%
been talking about dream time.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Out-of-body
experiences is an awareness

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.660 align:middle line:84%
that you're out of
your body, you're

00:15:52.660 --> 00:16:01.030 align:middle line:84%
witnessing the body
beneath you, and that it

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:05.500 align:middle line:84%
is an awareness at
that period of time

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.400 align:middle line:84%
that you are a multidimensional
being and awareness

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:90%
in your conscious state.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
begin to navigate what

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.270 align:middle line:90%
you want to do out of the body.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:20.440 align:middle line:84%
But initially, it could
be a bit shocking.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I rolled out of my
body into a field of plaid one

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:24.280 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.030 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what to
do with it so I just

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.585 align:middle line:90%
popped myself right back in.

00:16:27.585 --> 00:16:29.320 align:middle line:90%
I thought, what is this?

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.340 align:middle line:90%
I just rolled out.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:84%
I was lying in bed and I was
in a field of plaid lines.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So there's an
awareness, is there not?

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.480 align:middle line:90%
That everything's geometric.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Plaid is a geometric
form, isn't it?

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And
color has vibration.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And so what
you did as you rolled out

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.540 align:middle line:84%
of the body, your
consciousness aligned

00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:02.740 align:middle line:84%
with what was occurring with
what was known intellectually.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.646 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:04.646 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know--

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sure many people
when they leave their body,

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.829 align:middle line:84%
that it's common to see
grids and vector points,

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:14.490 align:middle line:84%
and that kind of thing,
which, as you say--

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yes, you can,
but it's not a constant.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.980 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the individual.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:84%
So now leaving your
body-- as you just

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.329 align:middle line:84%
said, if you're
leaving the body,

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:27.369 align:middle line:84%
you're actually outside
of yourself and aware

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:29.140 align:middle line:84%
and can look down
on yourself, kind

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.650 align:middle line:84%
of like near-death experiences
that people describe, right?

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:36.490 align:middle line:84%
What about when you need to
simply send your awareness

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.190 align:middle line:84%
somewhere to get
information in what's

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.320 align:middle line:90%
called more remote viewing?

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.510 align:middle line:84%
What's happening
there when you can

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:47.170 align:middle line:84%
send your consciousness to
a distant location and view

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:48.290 align:middle line:90%
things?

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So it is
remote viewing actually.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what part
of you is going there?

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Is it just an intention
of entanglement?

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: And it's intention.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:84%
It's intentional and
it's vibrational.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Everything has vibrational
frequency to it

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:09.430 align:middle line:84%
so you're going on those
lines of vibration.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So your mind
is more or less kind

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.210 align:middle line:84%
of entangling with those
lines of vibration,

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:20.030 align:middle line:84%
you have an intention, and it's
taking you to the destination

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:84%
so that you can bring
back information.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:26.500 align:middle line:84%
That's not the same as being
out of the body, right?

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That's different.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:28.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Being out of the body
is like by locating.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And there have
been many gurus or teachers who

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:40.420 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to put
their body in Samadhi,

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.610 align:middle line:90%
which is the paralysis state.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:90%
It appears it's dead, the body.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:90%
It is not.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.220 align:middle line:84%
It's just being held in
state, you might say,

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:55.410 align:middle line:84%
for the soul to
leave the body and be

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.800 align:middle line:84%
in another place
at the same time.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And there have been many
stories written of this

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.540 align:middle line:84%
from past history,
but this can be more

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.750 align:middle line:84%
the normal experience
of the human experience

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.910 align:middle line:84%
in the fifth
dimensionary energy.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's the recognition
of master heard or awareness,

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.360 align:middle line:84%
or social connectedness in that
awareness of knowing you're

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.410 align:middle line:90%
more than your physical body.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is
something that you

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.260 align:middle line:84%
see coming up as our
human potential becoming

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.850 align:middle line:84%
more common, a more common
occurrence for humanity.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there are
so many interested in it

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:40.050 align:middle line:84%
because they're on the
edges of that awareness

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:43.253 align:middle line:84%
and knowing and
wanting to know more.

00:19:43.253 --> 00:19:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I feel
like something was watching

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking to people, they're
confusing being out of body

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.760 align:middle line:84%
with remote viewing
when they say,

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I've just went and
got this information.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that's
a little confused.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.440 align:middle line:84%
That's why I wanted you to
break down what that one

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.063 align:middle line:90%
feels like versus the other.

00:20:01.063 --> 00:20:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It is
a bit different,

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.670 align:middle line:84%
but similar in many
ways, isn't it?

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:09.890 align:middle line:84%
That is why it's so confusing
because there are similarities

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.740 align:middle line:84%
because of the
multidimensionality of all

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.390 align:middle line:84%
of the things
you're speaking of.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you have an
out-of-body experience and you

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.790 align:middle line:84%
leave the body dormant somewhere
safe, in a quiet, safe space--

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:28.380 align:middle line:84%
you've done this, and you
can't have any body near you

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.970 align:middle line:90%
when you do this.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.070 align:middle line:84%
It's very disturbing
to the field.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:37.710 align:middle line:84%
What part of you is leaving
the physical body when you're

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:41.130 align:middle line:90%
talking about out-of-body?

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So as we said,
your soul is multidimensional.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So there
is that part of soul

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:55.200 align:middle line:84%
that is alive in the body
that gives the mind life.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And that allows
that part to stay

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.080 align:middle line:90%
in the body for that's life.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
awarenesses of this soul,

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's difficult to
describe for you have not

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:18.400 align:middle line:84%
an awareness of what that
could be in your thinking, that

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:24.190 align:middle line:84%
will come more so as there's
great insights into the mind

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:28.310 align:middle line:84%
and the functionality
of it as well.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:34.060 align:middle line:10%
Those parts of yourself that
are not keeping the body alive,

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.110 align:middle line:10%
and that's part of your
awareness in your brain,

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:44.060 align:middle line:10%
your mind, can leave the body
and have other experiences.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's all-- like every
cell of your body is you.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:54.760 align:middle line:84%
You could take your cell
out and make another you.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:55.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:58.400 align:middle line:90%
So would it be fair--

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just using the
parlance of one system,

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:05.900 align:middle line:84%
of saying that maybe the
lower mind part of the soul

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.740 align:middle line:84%
stays with the body and the
higher mind part of soul

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.100 align:middle line:84%
is the one that's free to leave
while the body is remaining

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.860 align:middle line:84%
under the control of the lower
mind, the body mind, the animal

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:17.660 align:middle line:90%
mind?

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: One could say
this, for lack of a better--

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, just finding
a very simple language for it.

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:26.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.960 align:middle line:90%
So one of the things that--

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.690 align:middle line:90%


00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:33.890 align:middle line:90%
it was a regression I had.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it wasn't
a dream, years ago.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.340 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things back, and
this was in very early times,

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:43.310 align:middle line:84%
in Lemurian times and
we were doing this.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.080 align:middle line:84%
There were some
people that did this.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.210 align:middle line:84%
You would sit your
body down somewhere,

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:84%
as you said, and put
it into a quiet state,

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:51.200 align:middle line:90%
as you've done in this lifetime.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And then we would
leave the body,

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.370 align:middle line:90%
but we were joining with other--

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:58.100 align:middle line:84%
in this case, with
birds, large birds.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And we would, with their
permission, join together

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.420 align:middle line:90%
and we would fly together.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:90%
And it was really wonderful.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.560 align:middle line:84%
You could feel everything
that the bird felt.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And the bird was in
agreement with it.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:11.510 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:12.380 align:middle line:90%
Just in agreement.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.630 align:middle line:84%
They didn't usually joy
ride or they didn't usually

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:18.530 align:middle line:84%
waste energies flying around
for kicks, mostly for prey.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:23.030 align:middle line:84%
But is that the part you
would say was going with that

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:24.410 align:middle line:90%
bird at that time?

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so can
this still happen today?

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Can people still merge
with other species?

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.090 align:middle line:84%
I know that was a long
time ago when we were

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.540 align:middle line:90%
configured very differently.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.340 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.510 align:middle line:84%
In today's world, is it
possible that we can still

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:45.540 align:middle line:84%
do something like this to be
able to merge with an animal

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.340 align:middle line:84%
if our intention and
practice was strong enough?

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You can,
but you would not

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:54.780 align:middle line:84%
merge physically with it,
but you could sense and feel

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:55.830 align:middle line:90%
what they're feeling.

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And that is part
of your shamanic background.

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:02.418 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: The shapeshifting
is what you're talking.

00:24:02.418 --> 00:24:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.840 align:middle line:90%
And becoming something else.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.860 align:middle line:84%
You can experience
something else, yes,

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:16.020 align:middle line:84%
just like you are experiencing
a human experience.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and that experience it
was taking part of my being

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and allowing it to
flow into the bird

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.350 align:middle line:90%
to have a joint experience.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:26.930 align:middle line:84%
It was their body
and a higher part

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.960 align:middle line:84%
of another part of my mind,
another dimension of mind.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.610 align:middle line:90%
And it was exhilarating and fun.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:34.115 align:middle line:84%
It was what we did
for entertainment.

00:24:34.115 --> 00:24:38.810 align:middle line:84%
In the day, there
was no Netflix so it

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.630 align:middle line:84%
was a very joyful experience
and it wasn't uncommon,

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.000 align:middle line:90%
and it wasn't harmful.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: No.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.570 align:middle line:90%
With proper intention.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With proper
intention, to be respectful.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes, respect.

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.660 align:middle line:90%
You could call that love.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the closest we
get to that for the most part

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.790 align:middle line:90%
now is in flying dreams.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So can you talk
about flying dreams.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.500 align:middle line:90%
Some people have a lot of them.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Some have none.

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Some would love to
and start and fall

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.030 align:middle line:90%
because they become afraid.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.670 align:middle line:84%
What's going on
when we're sensing

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:17.380 align:middle line:90%
these magnificent flying dreams?

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: What you're
experiencing is freedom.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.340 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's exhilarating.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:27.780 align:middle line:84%
You're not encased
in the physical form

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:33.570 align:middle line:84%
and you have the freedom to
be omnipresent, if you would,

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:38.190 align:middle line:84%
to feel as we feel
in that omnipresence.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:42.240 align:middle line:84%
We are only encased in
this physical existence

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.910 align:middle line:84%
by permission of the jailer
to speak to you in this form,

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:54.240 align:middle line:84%
but we are in that realm of
omnipresence energetically,

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.580 align:middle line:90%
of no space and time.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is it simply
symbolic in the dream

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.940 align:middle line:84%
or are we actually in an
experience of breaking

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.900 align:middle line:84%
free from physicality and we're
moving through space and time

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and we're just sensing
it or remembering it?

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You're
remembering it.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:19.020 align:middle line:84%
You're giving yourself
permission of that freedom.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So for
people who would

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:27.940 align:middle line:84%
love to do this or
remember this experience,

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.320 align:middle line:84%
what would you say, by
way of a little tutorial,

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.390 align:middle line:84%
to people who would
like to have more

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:36.660 align:middle line:84%
of that experience of
freedom during dream time?

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Believe it first.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.550 align:middle line:84%
It won't happen unless you
believe in its possibility.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:46.190 align:middle line:90%


00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:52.000 align:middle line:84%
It is the human conscious
state, the intellect,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.670 align:middle line:84%
that is the barrier to
all your experiences

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:01.130 align:middle line:90%
and the judger of all of them.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So as you're releasing
your judgment

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:09.280 align:middle line:84%
into the realm of
possibility thinking,

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:15.340 align:middle line:84%
you open the door for,
yes, it can happen.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.230 align:middle line:84%
For if you think
you can, you can.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.870 align:middle line:84%
If you think you
can't, you can't.

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:22.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:28.190 align:middle line:84%
So belief is the
barrier between you

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:32.660 align:middle line:84%
and your multidimensional
experiences.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:37.120 align:middle line:84%
So having set an
intention and know you're

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.830 align:middle line:90%
perfectly capable of this.

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:39.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And then you may have
some fear of the unknown.

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:46.160 align:middle line:90%
Be adventuresome.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that's a good place
to be adventuresome,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.108 align:middle line:90%
is in dream time.

00:27:51.108 --> 00:27:53.650 align:middle line:84%
I meant to ask you something a
little earlier before we close

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:56.980 align:middle line:84%
the subject of dreams, and that
is once we're out of our body

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.320 align:middle line:84%
and we're having these other
dimensional experiences,

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.840 align:middle line:84%
some of them can take
us quite far away

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.630 align:middle line:90%
from this dimension in reality.

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And I have found, for
example, if something happens,

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.020 align:middle line:84%
like a very loud
noise or pressure

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.530 align:middle line:84%
on the body from my dog
or Zeus, or something,

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:18.550 align:middle line:84%
that I snap back so
fast I'm disoriented

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.570 align:middle line:90%
for quite a long time.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:23.050 align:middle line:84%
It really kind of
ruins the morning.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:25.210 align:middle line:84%
If we snap back too
quickly and have

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:27.400 align:middle line:84%
this sense of lack
of integration,

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.820 align:middle line:84%
what are some techniques we can
use to reintegrate ourselves?

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE:
Breathing, of course.

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:33.640 align:middle line:90%
Deep breathing.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Deliberate deep breathing,
filling the lungs

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and exhaling completely
several times.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:46.330 align:middle line:84%
You can count to it,
taking several deep breaths

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:52.330 align:middle line:84%
in five to six, exhaling
the same count out.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:56.720 align:middle line:90%
And water, drink water.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And put your
bare feet on the ground.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Water, breathing, get
your feet on the ground.

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:06.170 align:middle line:90%
Get grounded physically.

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.290 align:middle line:90%
And breathe into that as well.

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.460 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Another area of being in
dream time and collaborating,

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:21.020 align:middle line:84%
like we were talking
about a little bit ago,

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.770 align:middle line:90%
has to do with healing.

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:30.380 align:middle line:84%
How much of our healing does
or could be taking place

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:34.010 align:middle line:84%
during dream time if
we simply understand

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:36.350 align:middle line:84%
there are aspects
of ourselves working

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.990 align:middle line:84%
with other beings and
other dimensions that

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:43.750 align:middle line:84%
are perfectly capable of
bringing physical effect?

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That's true.

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And intention can be
achieved in that as well.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:57.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's also to place
intent in loving the body.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:84%
We hear so many humans
berating the physical body,

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.875 align:middle line:90%
and it's magnificent.

00:30:04.875 --> 00:30:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a miracle.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And
the body is always

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:10.410 align:middle line:90%
trying to find its homeostasis.

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:13.010 align:middle line:90%


00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:15.570 align:middle line:84%
What you call healing,
we call balancing.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Coming
into full balance.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:23.990 align:middle line:84%
So loving the body, energizing
the body, saying it's

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:27.560 align:middle line:84%
whole, healthy
functioning perfectly.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And the body will inform
you of what it needs,

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:36.080 align:middle line:84%
whether it's
supplementation of nutrition

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.500 align:middle line:84%
or even if it needs a
balance of medication,

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.610 align:middle line:90%
homeopathic or allopathic.

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:43.690 align:middle line:90%
Both are good.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Both come from the
same source actually.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Many think that
not, but it's true.

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is true.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:55.806 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: So it's awareness.

00:30:55.806 --> 00:30:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And can
you ask to be--

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.850 align:middle line:84%
can you ask to have healing
partnerships during dream time?

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
you will have teams

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.820 align:middle line:84%
of beings that know how to
do this properly working

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:09.080 align:middle line:90%
with the human matrix.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.670 align:middle line:90%
They will come.

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Of course.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:14.540 align:middle line:90%
In the asking, it is given.

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
waiting to be asked.

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
another problem we have.

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:20.600 align:middle line:90%
This is a big problem.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.510 align:middle line:84%
All of these
wonderful beings that

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.720 align:middle line:84%
are underemployed
by humanity, can you

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.970 align:middle line:90%
talk about that for a moment?

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:33.920 align:middle line:84%
How much help is actually there
and how little we actually

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.810 align:middle line:90%
tap into it consciously?

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Very little.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:43.340 align:middle line:84%
We cannot even describe the
enormity of what is there

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.600 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.210 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a
perception of it.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And understand this, no
limitation to space and time,

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:57.750 align:middle line:84%
that omnipresence
of what we speak.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And your free will, your soul's
power, the master that you are,

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:11.490 align:middle line:84%
there is no one other in the
universe greater than you.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:19.320 align:middle line:84%
So your will, your power
will not be usurped.

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.260 align:middle line:84%
That's why in the
asking, it will be given.

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:28.590 align:middle line:84%
You're making
welcome that input.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it a
little bit painful

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:33.630 align:middle line:84%
to watch from the other
side, that we're floundering

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.390 align:middle line:84%
around not even asking
for magnificent help

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.430 align:middle line:84%
that could be given
because of the limitations

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:41.900 align:middle line:90%
of the human intellect?

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's
a bit frustrating,

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:48.710 align:middle line:84%
but we like to look
at it humorously.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:50.045 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm sure you do.

00:32:50.045 --> 00:32:53.330 align:middle line:84%
I always joke about it
as guides on a smoke

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.197 align:middle line:90%
break with not much to do.

00:32:56.197 --> 00:32:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Only we don't smoke.

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:00.360 align:middle line:90%
Only you don't smoke.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.190 align:middle line:84%
This is a fun-- this
is kind of a fun dream,

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:07.050 align:middle line:84%
but it can get into
some other areas.

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:08.190 align:middle line:90%
I had a dream one time.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:10.730 align:middle line:84%
There was this lovely woman in
my hometown, very well known

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:14.030 align:middle line:90%
in our hometown at the time.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:16.970 align:middle line:84%
She was in marketing and
kind of everybody knew her.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:19.850 align:middle line:90%
She was the town queen.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:20.870 align:middle line:90%
Lovely lady.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And I had a dream that she
and I were at an event.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.150 align:middle line:90%
It was a party of some kind.

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And we decided to play a trick
on some of the other people

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.110 align:middle line:84%
by choosing to
consciously swap bodies.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So we were going to
each get out of our body

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and send our consciousness into
the other one and tell people,

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:47.000 align:middle line:84%
you can ask me a question
and I can answer it

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.470 align:middle line:90%
as though I'm her.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And so they would be
able to test us and see

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.258 align:middle line:90%
if what had happened is true.

00:33:52.258 --> 00:33:54.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a
little twist at the end

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:56.175 align:middle line:84%
because she was 40 years
older and wouldn't give me

00:33:56.175 --> 00:33:57.020 align:middle line:90%
my body back.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.860 align:middle line:84%
But the notion of being
able to do something

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.290 align:middle line:84%
like this, what
was actually going

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:06.090 align:middle line:90%
on in a situation like that?

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So you
did exactly what

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:10.639 align:middle line:90%
you said you were going to do.

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:14.750 align:middle line:84%
You have the power to
do that, to exchange,

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:17.510 align:middle line:90%
to become the other person.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.197 align:middle line:84%
That's what actors
do, do they not?

00:34:19.197 --> 00:34:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:20.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They
become that personality

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.280 align:middle line:90%
that there are to act.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we brought all the
knowledge and history with it

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.960 align:middle line:90%
into each other.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.110 align:middle line:84%
We could feel us
leaving our bodies

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:37.239 align:middle line:90%
and re-entering the other body.

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:39.335 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So you've
answered your own question.

00:34:39.335 --> 00:34:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that is
what was going on.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So people
have the capability

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:47.440 align:middle line:84%
to do this in dream
time, but do we or are

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.750 align:middle line:84%
we going to be able to
develop the capability

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:51.969 align:middle line:90%
to do this in waking time?

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You already have
the capability of doing it.

00:34:55.850 --> 00:35:01.120 align:middle line:84%
It's just knowing
you have that power.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.950 align:middle line:84%
We probably should not
use the word power.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:04.930 align:middle line:90%
It's off-putting.

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it's a little
off-putting, but the ability.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: The ability.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Because people are afraid
of power, aren't they?

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of being overpowered.

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:19.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is there ever
a time or an advantage

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:27.590 align:middle line:84%
where one could change
bodies, just experience

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:29.690 align:middle line:84%
the other person's
body for a bit?

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Tell us in what conditions, once
we develop the understanding

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:36.920 align:middle line:84%
this is possible and
the capability to do it,

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.975 align:middle line:84%
where and when this
could be actually useful.

00:35:38.975 --> 00:35:41.630 align:middle line:90%


00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Only by permission.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:44.648 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By
permission, of course.

00:35:44.648 --> 00:35:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: But more it's
useful for the individual

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.980 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that they're
more than their physical body

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:55.200 align:middle line:90%
and more capable of many things.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.168 align:middle line:84%
So it's more just a
confirmation of it.

00:35:58.168 --> 00:35:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
more than just walking

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.470 align:middle line:90%
a mile in someone's shoes.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.610 align:middle line:84%
So there's compassion
and understanding

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:06.810 align:middle line:90%
that can be achieved.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: But not only are
you carrying whatever they've

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:18.130 align:middle line:84%
learned and the knowledge,
as you speak of it,

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:22.500 align:middle line:84%
but everything else
that's not yours to carry.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's a fascinating
proposition.

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was interesting,
at least in the dream.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about--

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:32.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, I want to talk
about one other thing

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.860 align:middle line:84%
before we go to
another subject, which

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.680 align:middle line:84%
has to do with people who
are encountering or meeting

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.250 align:middle line:84%
with what appear to
be off-planet beings

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and having experiences
in dream time.

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:48.510 align:middle line:84%
But before that, the whole
notion of saying, oh,

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:49.560 align:middle line:90%
you're not in your body.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.120 align:middle line:90%
You need to get in your body.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.040 align:middle line:84%
When people say
this, sometimes I

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.560 align:middle line:84%
don't think they really know
what they're talking about.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.970 align:middle line:84%
As you say, the soul and this
multidimensional aspect of self

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.160 align:middle line:84%
is far larger than
the human body.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And so what do you take to
mean by a healthy connection

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.395 align:middle line:90%
between the two?

00:37:10.395 --> 00:37:13.120 align:middle line:90%


00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We find
that statement,

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:17.890 align:middle line:84%
you need to get in
your body, a judgment.

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do too.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.350 align:middle line:90%
I find it a judgment.

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: And it's offensive.

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:26.550 align:middle line:84%
So please explain what
actually is taking place?

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: What is taking
place is on the individual that

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:35.800 align:middle line:84%
thinks you need to
be in your body has

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:42.740 align:middle line:84%
some issue with possibly the
interaction that is being had.

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:48.130 align:middle line:84%
But if you are ungrounded
in your body, you know that.

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:50.860 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it in your cells.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And you can do things
that can ground you

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:58.330 align:middle line:90%
in the body if necessary.

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But not get--

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and I made the mistake one
time of trying to pull myself

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:05.290 align:middle line:90%
into my physical body.

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And I got about this far
and had a screaming headache

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:09.710 align:middle line:90%
and started crying.

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh my God,
that would be pure torture

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.860 align:middle line:84%
to live in the human,
inside the body--

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You can't pull
all that energy into this one

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:18.940 align:middle line:90%
physical--

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --container.

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So the reality is
we are connected.

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And are we
connected through the organs,

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.860 align:middle line:90%
through the chakras.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Where are our primary
connection points into the body?

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: The chakras.

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:36.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.380 align:middle line:90%
But every cell.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.707 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because it permeates.

00:38:39.707 --> 00:38:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It does.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We permeate all of us.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yes, but
it's more than that.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:48.130 align:middle line:84%
You're more than this physical
body and the energy of the soul

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:49.840 align:middle line:90%
is much larger than that.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:55.920 align:middle line:84%
If you were to extend your
arms out from your shoulders,

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:59.200 align:middle line:84%
you could imagine
to begin imagining

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.410 align:middle line:84%
the energy of your
body extending out

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:06.290 align:middle line:84%
from your fingertips,
your soul's energy.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:08.990 align:middle line:84%
You could touch
the opposite walls.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You can feel the
density of that with intention.

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're so much
larger, so much greater, so

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.280 align:middle line:84%
much more multidimensional
than we have the capacity

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.420 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that you just

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:28.100 align:middle line:84%
said a moment ago that
I think is so terribly

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:33.120 align:middle line:84%
important is there's so much
help and we don't ask for it.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What could
life look like for us--

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.010 align:middle line:90%
what could life look--

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:39.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's say we all woke
up tomorrow and realize

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:42.920 align:middle line:84%
we have this vast system
of help around us.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.890 align:middle line:84%
What could life look like
for humanity, any one of us

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:49.070 align:middle line:84%
individually, if we realize
that starting this moment?

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Ease and
grace, not the difficulty

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:57.030 align:middle line:90%
of feeling like you're pushing.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:40:03.210 align:middle line:84%
You'll be receiving
intentionally

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:09.800 align:middle line:84%
all these systems should
desire for it's open to you.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet as human
beings, part of the journey

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:16.880 align:middle line:84%
is to learn how to deal with
challenge, overcome challenge,

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.100 align:middle line:84%
but what better way than
to ask for a little help?

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:21.630 align:middle line:90%


00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:24.225 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Receptivity
is your greatest lesson.

00:40:24.225 --> 00:40:27.000 align:middle line:90%


00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because there's
something in us that feels

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.670 align:middle line:90%
undeserving because of--

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:34.200 align:middle line:84%
we can go into that in
another conversation,

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.050 align:middle line:84%
the various beings who've
come by this planet

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:39.720 align:middle line:84%
and who have exerted
influence and made humans

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.670 align:middle line:90%
to feel less than and small.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:43.343 align:middle line:90%
And this continues to this day.

00:40:43.343 --> 00:40:45.510 align:middle line:84%
We've given our power away
to pretty much everything

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and everybody, to
doctors, to preachers,

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:51.850 align:middle line:90%
to politicians and teachers.

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:52.720 align:middle line:90%
That's what we do.

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.060 align:middle line:84%
We give our authority
and power away.

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.530 align:middle line:90%
And you're-- I'm going--

00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:58.583 align:middle line:84%
I would like you
to comment on that.

00:40:58.583 --> 00:40:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Of course.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:04.330 align:middle line:84%
You have spoken with us
about our knowing of this

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and why we've come, to encourage
and to teach you as a species

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:21.320 align:middle line:84%
how to recognize and bring this
fragmentation that occurred

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:25.480 align:middle line:84%
between your human
self and your soul

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:31.030 align:middle line:84%
into cohesiveness in the
recognition of the magnificence

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:35.830 align:middle line:84%
that you are, the soul
integration process.

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, no
more worthy journey.

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:40.090 align:middle line:90%
That's the journey that matters.

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:43.070 align:middle line:90%
And we've had so much--

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:43.870 align:middle line:90%
covered so much.

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:46.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to save the whole
ET thing for another day.

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:47.892 align:middle line:84%
We'll have another
conversation about that.

00:41:47.892 --> 00:41:49.870 align:middle line:84%
We'll just stay with
the human matrix for now

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:51.370 align:middle line:90%
in our own capabilities.

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And Theo, I want to thank you
so much for explaining some

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:57.310 align:middle line:84%
of these things to us
and for reminding us

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:59.740 align:middle line:84%
that all the help is
there if we just ask,

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:04.180 align:middle line:84%
and that we're so capable
if we just believe.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: If you could
see ourselves as we see you,

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:10.620 align:middle line:90%
there would be no discontent.

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.490 align:middle line:90%
There would only be love.

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:15.630 align:middle line:84%
You are complete
with your asking.

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I am.

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:17.630 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Theo.

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:19.887 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: God's love unto you.

00:42:19.887 --> 00:42:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.595 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Good day.

00:42:21.595 --> 00:42:27.490 align:middle line:90%


00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:28.632 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hello, Sheila.

00:42:28.632 --> 00:42:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Hi, Regina.

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:30.585 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was fun.

00:42:30.585 --> 00:42:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Oh, good.

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
we got into a lot

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:36.970 align:middle line:84%
of different topics about the
human potential, the parts

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:39.880 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves that we don't
even think about, that we don't

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.490 align:middle line:90%
understand, that we fear even.

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And I thought Theo did a lovely
job explaining some things that

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.340 align:middle line:90%
are misunderstood.

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:51.880 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things we talked
about was how we're just--

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.580 align:middle line:84%
we can't even
comprehend how much help

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:59.610 align:middle line:84%
is just right here around
us waiting to be asked,

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:00.500 align:middle line:90%
and myself included.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And I know better.

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:04.660 align:middle line:90%
And when I ask, I just laugh.

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:07.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm so shocked at
the creative ways

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:13.450 align:middle line:84%
in which help comes that I would
never imagine just by asking.

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You know
what I start doing?

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Theo's encouraged us before we
even put our feet on the floor

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.620 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, is to think
of something we're great--

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:25.960 align:middle line:84%
one thing we're
grateful for, one thing

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.700 align:middle line:90%
we're proud of ourselves for.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing
that I do is I

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:37.570 align:middle line:84%
say, I am open and receptive
to all angelic assistance now,

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:38.800 align:middle line:90%
this day.

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Perfect.

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:42.452 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So those are
my three things before I--

00:43:42.452 --> 00:43:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Say them one
more time for all of us.

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:47.740 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: Be grateful for
one thing, be proud of yourself

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:52.510 align:middle line:10%
for one thing, and ask
for angelic assistance

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:54.040 align:middle line:10%
every morning.

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.050 align:middle line:90%
I know that it works.

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:58.150 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely works.

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like such a dumdum
myself that I hesitate to--

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.040 align:middle line:90%
I just don't think to ask.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.170 align:middle line:84%
I think, oh, I'll
muscle through this.

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:06.987 align:middle line:84%
No, we don't have
to do it that way.

00:44:06.987 --> 00:44:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Well, what do we do?

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.210 align:middle line:84%
We wake up in the
morning and we start

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:13.600 align:middle line:84%
thinking about the things
we didn't do yesterday,

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.460 align:middle line:84%
the things we have
to get done today.

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.230 align:middle line:90%
I mean, our mind goes to work.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So
repetitive and boring.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So it's like,
stop, do those three things,

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:25.340 align:middle line:90%
and then go.

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:26.173 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:44:26.173 --> 00:44:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your
life since I've known--

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.440 align:middle line:84%
I've known you, I don't
know, maybe 12 years or so.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.240 align:middle line:90%
A while.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.260 align:middle line:90%
Quite a while now.

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your life
does flow with what

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.300 align:middle line:90%
seems to be grace and ease.

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And one way you can tell
is that you don't change.

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:42.350 align:middle line:90%
You don't age.

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Everything seems to
come when you need it.

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.130 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you
don't have challenges.

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:47.090 align:middle line:90%
We all have them.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:51.590 align:middle line:84%
But you live that life
of grace and ease.

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I've
been a good student.

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have been
a very good student.

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And you've been a wonderful
teacher for everyone

00:44:58.210 --> 00:44:59.010 align:middle line:90%
here as well.

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So Sheila, thank you
so much for joining us.

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And your "Art of Relationship"
book is coming out.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And so next time
we get together,

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:07.800 align:middle line:90%
we'll talk about that.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I'd love to do that.

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, very good.

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:10.463 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Sheila.

00:45:10.463 --> 00:45:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Thank you.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I hope this has been
enlightening and educating

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.590 align:middle line:84%
on some of the more
common human phenomena.

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you can reach Sheila
