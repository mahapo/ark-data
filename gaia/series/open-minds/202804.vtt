00:00:19.022 --> 00:00:20.480 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
The top concerns

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.000 align:middle line:10%
regarding the
invasiveness of RF and EMF

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.420 align:middle line:10%
technology has been
the introduction of 5G.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Ben Stewart of Gaia
is here with us today

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.160 align:middle line:84%
to share the information
he's researched regarding

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:90%
5G and its potential benefits.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And most people say,
ah, potential benefits.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't see any benefits.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into some
of the basics first,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.950 align:middle line:84%
such as, why do
we even need this?

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.003 align:middle line:90%
Is 4G not fast enough?

00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN STEWART: It'll never
be fast enough, you know?

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.680 align:middle line:10%
I think--

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's the answer.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.470 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.960 align:middle line:10%
When you go back
to 1G, I think it

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.010 align:middle line:10%
might have been by 2G,
which was around 1991, when

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.090 align:middle line:10%
the internet started, where it
was somewhere around like 50

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle line:10%
kilobytes per second.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And then like later, in
1999, I think that was 3G.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.050 align:middle line:84%
2000, that was
when you could get

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.940 align:middle line:90%
web browsing on your phones.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.992 align:middle line:90%
So that's where the Gs come in.

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:17.450 align:middle line:84%
These are the
different generations

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.750 align:middle line:90%
of mobile phone communications.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And every single time,
the data packages

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:90%
would get faster and faster.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And so as of 4G,
it's fairly fast.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:84%
But to let that be the only
part of the conversation

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.890 align:middle line:84%
is really just
kind of not looking

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.370 align:middle line:84%
at what 5G really
is, in my opinion,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:90%
because the speed of it, sure.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:84%
In 5G, instead of
having to wait,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.650 align:middle line:84%
let's say, two, three minutes
to download a 2-gigabyte film,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.660 align:middle line:84%
you can do it in
two, three seconds.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So yes, that's
quite a bit faster.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Many are saying it's 100,000
times faster than 4G.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.560 align:middle line:84%
One thing that it's going to
do is also use the 4G spectrum

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and then build on top of it
the 5G spectrum, which is--

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.670 align:middle line:84%
they're are much more rapid,
tinier, millimeter waves.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:84%
So it's adding to it
instead of taking it down.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's just a whole
slew of different things--

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.370 align:middle line:84%
how the infrastructure
is getting built,

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.710 align:middle line:84%
what that's going to
mean for property value,

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.997 align:middle line:90%
what it means for our health--

00:02:17.997 --> 00:02:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All of
which we'll get into.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.783 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the thing
is, as a human being

00:02:21.783 --> 00:02:25.850 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, most of us
need the internet for kind

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.680 align:middle line:84%
of basic stuff,
for the most part.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: 5G, what
you're going to need it

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:84%
for is no latency, no lag time
between sending and receiving

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.740 align:middle line:90%
the message.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So that means
somebody in New York--

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.610 align:middle line:84%
let's say a surgeon in New York
could be operating on somebody

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:84%
in Afghanistan in
real time using--

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.380 align:middle line:84%
obviously, in the field,
it'll be a machine.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So in a tent, a
soldier's wounded.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.450 align:middle line:90%
There's a machine in the tent.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And the surgeon is back in New
York, and in real time, moving.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.350 align:middle line:90%
And the system won't go down.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:90%
There's no lag time.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.600 align:middle line:90%
There's no dropped calls.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Thank god, because that would
be disastrous in that setting.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.683 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Another big one
that's definitely going

00:03:07.683 --> 00:03:11.840 align:middle line:84%
to happen, in my opinion, this
decade, between 2020 to 2030,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
is self-driving cars,
potentially to the point where

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.490 align:middle line:84%
we won't have drivers in cars
anymore, because eventually,

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.640 align:middle line:84%
if we get to do it like
China, where Alibaba,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.280 align:middle line:84%
in their smart cities,
of which there are 123--

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we're
going to get into that.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't know
about smart cities.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to have you
explain it in detail.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Great.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So Alibaba is
like our version of Amazon.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And their algorithms
are basically--

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.920 align:middle line:84%
they're keeping traffic
down maybe 15, 20%,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.400 align:middle line:84%
just by rerouting
through the GPS.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, when you
have self-driving cars,

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.880 align:middle line:90%
they're just too fast.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.220 align:middle line:84%
They're merging at 60, 70
miles an hour, because it can.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.270 align:middle line:90%
It's all computerized.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.625 align:middle line:84%
Then somebody wanting
to drive their car

00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:56.750 align:middle line:90%
is not going to be allowed.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:90%
That's a liability.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
certain things where

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I can see there would
be benefit for having

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:90%
no lag time, no interference.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.530 align:middle line:84%
You and I, technically, if the
technology to build a hologram,

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:84%
we'd be having this conversation
in real time, no lag,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.560 align:middle line:84%
better than Star Wars, when
you'd see Princess Leia pop up.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right?

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.843 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
really futuristic stuff

00:04:24.843 --> 00:04:25.760 align:middle line:90%
here that's happening.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.180 align:middle line:84%
But 5G is more than
just fast internet,

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:84%
because what it's
going to have to take

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of technology--
the internet of things.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:90%
You might have heard that term.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And that basically
means technology

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.600 align:middle line:90%
talking with technology.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So without
getting too far ahead

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.310 align:middle line:84%
of myself, one of the
biggest things about 5G,

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand what's
been happening since 1G.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's data propagation.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lot of data.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's data about you,
data about me out there.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And with just a
few parameters, you

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.180 align:middle line:84%
can find out a lot about
us, never having met us.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.758 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Now we're
getting to the point

00:05:04.758 --> 00:05:06.920 align:middle line:84%
where it's not humans
that are poring over this.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.230 align:middle line:90%
It's AI poring over the data.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's also your pill bottles
are talking to your doctor.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Your diapers are
talking to your phone.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Your refrigerator is
talking to your phone.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Your car is talking to
whoever the manufacturer is.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
the internet of things,

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.800 align:middle line:84%
all these devices
talking with one another,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:90%
proliferating their own data.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the
people who don't

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.850 align:middle line:84%
like everything being surveilled
and everything being known,

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.850 align:middle line:84%
like what's happening in China
right now in like, let's say,

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Wuhan, where a smart city,
you're in the device.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.420 align:middle line:84%
5G-- we talk about the
evolution of mobile phones.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, you're
not going to need--

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.410 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of slow and clunky
to have to manually enter stuff

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.610 align:middle line:90%
into your phone.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So some of the richest
people out there, Jeff Bezos

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.720 align:middle line:84%
being one, Donald
Trump being another,

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.880 align:middle line:84%
they have a personalized
AI butler, if you will.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:84%
It's an assistant that can
give you your news super fast

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.510 align:middle line:90%
if you're in between meetings.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:84%
It knows how to
scour the internet

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.950 align:middle line:84%
for certain information
you'd like to know.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.010 align:middle line:84%
That's coming with 5G
as well, so that it's--

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.710 align:middle line:84%
5G isn't just faster
download speeds.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.540 align:middle line:84%
What it is is also the ability
for technology to get smarter

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.692 align:middle line:84%
and then to use these algorithms
to get smarter on their own.

00:06:25.692 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I know.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.390 align:middle line:90%
And I think what--

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.810 align:middle line:84%
thank you for explaining it
so articulately, by the way.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.850 align:middle line:84%
I think, of course,
what concerns people is

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.190 align:middle line:90%
who controls that information.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.320 align:middle line:84%
That's always going to
be the big factor, the X

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.290 align:middle line:90%
factor in this.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.900 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about the notion--

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.110 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into the
notion of cybersecurity,

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:84%
for example, because this
seems to play largely

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.020 align:middle line:84%
into it as well, and then also
what happens when you start

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle line:90%
factoring in quantum computing.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.630 align:middle line:84%
So just looking at 5G and
then looking at how that--

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:84%
where do we leap into
quantum computing from there?

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
different world.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: It is.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's-- you just
take it away and explain things

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:90%
to us.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: OK, well--

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And cybersecurity
and where that factors in.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I'll start
there, with cybersecurity.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.090 align:middle line:84%
The interesting
thing about security

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.970 align:middle line:84%
is you have to frame
the conversation.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.730 align:middle line:90%
What does that really mean?

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.660 align:middle line:84%
We're still living in a world
where there's countries, right?

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.290 align:middle line:84%
So the big threat, at
least on the face of it,

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.745 align:middle line:90%
seems to be China and the US.

00:07:24.745 --> 00:07:27.310 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.200 align:middle line:84%
There is this company,
and they're probably

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.970 align:middle line:84%
the number-two mobile
phone technology company.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But as far as 5G,
their number one.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.630 align:middle line:90%
And that's one Huawei.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.470 align:middle line:90%
And Huawei is a Chinese company.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And their technology goes into,
let's say, apps like TikTok,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.570 align:middle line:90%
you might have heard of.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, the big issue, whether
this-- this has been slanted.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.970 align:middle line:90%
And we'll get into this as well.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.500 align:middle line:90%
But what's real?

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.020 align:middle line:84%
What media is actually
real that's coming to you?

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: But as
far as cybersecurity,

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.380 align:middle line:84%
getting back to Huawei, one
thing that was found-- people

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:07.000 align:middle line:84%
might be hearing about that now,
because just a few years back,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.015 align:middle line:84%
it was banned, federally banned
here in the United States.

00:08:10.015 --> 00:08:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain it to us.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:90%
Explain the nature of it.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So Huawei is, again,
it's a technology company.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And in their technology,
they have smartphones.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And they also build
5G infrastructure.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.160 align:middle line:90%
So that's in China.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:84%
But we also-- we buy
Chinese technology.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.177 align:middle line:84%
Africa has tons
of Samsung phones.

00:08:28.177 --> 00:08:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
creating our Apple phones.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.240 align:middle line:84%
So the fear-- let's
just start there.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:84%
The fear of it is that any of
our data that we're propagating

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:90%
can be--

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.680 align:middle line:84%
I actually have this
documentation here with me.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.740 align:middle line:84%
There was, I think it might have
been a senator out of Texas--

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm forgetting his name.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:54.790 align:middle line:84%
But he basically said that it
has been found that they have--

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:59.980 align:middle line:84%
so Chinese, obviously, being
communist, they own business.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:84%
So any business
there has in kind

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.940 align:middle line:84%
of what their government has
set up, they have to hand over,

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.750 align:middle line:84%
if they're asked,
any and all data.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:14.035 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So with that, it
has been speculated by some.

00:09:14.035 --> 00:09:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Some are saying
it wasn't proven.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Some are saying that it
has been proven that--

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.402 align:middle line:84%
I think it was from
the US to Europe,

00:09:21.402 --> 00:09:23.110 align:middle line:84%
there was supposed to
be a data transfer.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And they go in big
shipments of data.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And this was routed through
China first for analyzing

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and then routed to where it
was eventually supposed to go.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:84%
So long story short,
the US federally

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.490 align:middle line:84%
banned Huawei and
their technology here.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:41.840 align:middle line:90%
And then we've pressured Europe.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.530 align:middle line:84%
So now Europe has
a-- well, especially

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:84%
the UK has a 2027 initiative
to where they will phase out

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.340 align:middle line:90%
all Huawei technology.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Same with France and Germany.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say the
difficult thing here

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.600 align:middle line:84%
is it really seems
like we're trying

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.940 align:middle line:90%
to pit country against country.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And every
time that happens,

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.580 align:middle line:84%
I try to take a look at,
what's the bigger play here?

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And really, I think
that we're already--

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:09.760 align:middle line:90%
not to be alarmist.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I think we're already in the
midst of some pre-emptive World

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.170 align:middle line:90%
War III.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.360 align:middle line:90%
It starts with trade wars.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.170 align:middle line:90%
It starts much more hush-hush.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
kind of positioning.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:84%
But wars, in our minds,
we go back to World War

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:24.700 align:middle line:90%
I, World War II--

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.742 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the ditches.

00:10:25.742 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle line:90%
No, it's a new kind of war.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.417 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It's a
new kind of war.

00:10:28.417 --> 00:10:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think, as soon as big
data became bigger than big oil,

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.620 align:middle line:84%
which is-- it's now
exponentially growing

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.570 align:middle line:90%
in that direction.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.430 align:middle line:84%
As soon as that
happened, I really

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:41.540 align:middle line:84%
think that every country
started realizing, we need--

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.710 align:middle line:90%
they're saying 5G.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.730 align:middle line:84%
But that just basically means,
we need the best and fastest

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:47.780 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And right now,
one of the worries

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.090 align:middle line:84%
is that China seems to be
five years ahead in this.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And if that can help them
get to AI, especially AGI,

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.580 align:middle line:84%
which is Artificial
General Intelligence--

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:84%
if they can get to that first,
then people like Sam Harris

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:11.450 align:middle line:84%
say being six months ahead could
mean being 500,000 years ahead,

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.090 align:middle line:84%
at a minimum, just at
the rate at which AI

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.140 align:middle line:90%
will start advancing quicker.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.290 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
why we're seeing

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:22.040 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the topsy-turviness
and the finger pointing

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:84%
at China, which it's
all just technology,

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.250 align:middle line:90%
if you think about it.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.530 align:middle line:84%
But that's the direction
that we're going.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So I want to make it very
clear that 5G is related to AI

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.510 align:middle line:84%
and related to
advanced technology.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And that, nowadays, has
everything to do with security.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.860 align:middle line:84%
So cybersecurity--
I think it's going

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.840 align:middle line:84%
to have to go through
a bunch of evolutions,

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.750 align:middle line:84%
because every time
something changes

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:51.050 align:middle line:84%
where there's like a
very powerful firewall,

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.560 align:middle line:84%
it kind of seems to be like
a constitution or some kind

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.560 align:middle line:84%
of legislation, where
there's always loopholes.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.950 align:middle line:90%
And then those get exploited.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And eventually,
that might reach a point

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.580 align:middle line:84%
where it's just harder and
harder to crack through a wall.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.080 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's
when we're going

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:84%
to see a dominant
superpower on the planet.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure
what that looks like.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know if that will
be marked off by countries.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:90%
It could be rich technocrats.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It could be, yes.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, and just to affirm
that, in that conversation

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.480 align:middle line:84%
I had with Deep Prasad,
he basically-- it

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.550 align:middle line:84%
confirms what you're
saying, is that

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.090 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
quantum computing,

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:34.130 align:middle line:84%
which is a very esoteric, kind
of almost secretive world.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.570 align:middle line:84%
The people that
are involved in it

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.028 align:middle line:84%
and what it's being
used for-- this

00:12:37.028 --> 00:12:40.220 align:middle line:84%
is not in our purview to
know about at this time.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:45.020 align:middle line:84%
But he did say, because
I asked about it--

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:49.160 align:middle line:84%
he did say that right
now, when it comes to--

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.870 align:middle line:84%
and he's talking about
the quantum field

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.787 align:middle line:84%
and reducing noise in
the field to make a more

00:12:52.787 --> 00:12:55.360 align:middle line:90%
focused connection, right?

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.410 align:middle line:84%
He said, right now,
the Chinese are ahead

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.650 align:middle line:84%
in that too in the world
of quantum computing.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, whoever owns
quantum computing in the end

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:04.940 align:middle line:90%
dominates.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying they're
ahead in 5G technology as well.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's, again, not--

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm not trying to--

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.237 align:middle line:90%
I'm not xenophobic.

00:13:13.237 --> 00:13:15.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to pit
countries against countries.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.910 align:middle line:84%
We're just looking
at what happens

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:84%
when you have a concentration
of the ability to manage

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.540 align:middle line:90%
and surveil with data.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- we're really
seeing a lot of that--

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:90%
the surveillance part of it.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:32.660 align:middle line:84%
So before I get into the
quantum computing side of it,

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.820 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking
about cybersecurity,

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.130 align:middle line:84%
some people also
think like, well, I--

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.860 align:middle line:84%
individually, I have a
right to my own security.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.060 align:middle line:90%
And that's correct.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:44.543 align:middle line:90%
But where's the line?

00:13:44.543 --> 00:13:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where is the line?

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Because when we're
talking about being surveilled,

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.790 align:middle line:90%
where is security?

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.880 align:middle line:84%
What's done for
your safety, right?

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I might feel violated
by some surveillance, where

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:84%
the explanation is, well,
this is for your security.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.120 align:middle line:90%
And we have to--

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who gets
to decide, right?

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So data--
the big thing about data

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:84%
is, there's a lot of
data on everyone now.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And now it's
getting to the point

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.930 align:middle line:84%
where even in schools,
everyone is given a tablet.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.110 align:middle line:84%
We're there to put
our information down.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:23.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about it, what
1G to 5G has been thus far

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.555 align:middle line:84%
is a big survey about everything
about us, even social media.

00:14:27.555 --> 00:14:28.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So you're
sitting there scrolling,

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.008 align:middle line:90%
let's say on Instagram.

00:14:31.008 --> 00:14:32.330 align:middle line:90%
You're scrolling up.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Not only does it take a look
at what do you click Like on--

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.970 align:middle line:90%
and they can tell a lot by that.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.390 align:middle line:90%
I won't go into it.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.675 align:middle line:84%
But just with a few parameters,
they can tell a lot about you.

00:14:42.675 --> 00:14:44.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you're scrolling
past something,

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and then you stop
and scroll back,

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.190 align:middle line:84%
they're like, oh, that
image means something.

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So Instagram then,
owned by Facebook,

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.610 align:middle line:84%
shares that with,
let's say, Netflix.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.460 align:middle line:90%
And this is hypothetical.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Netflix has-- for everything
you're scrolling through,

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking at
the images, the icons,

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.170 align:middle line:84%
the thumbnails for the shows
or the movies that you want

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.780 align:middle line:84%
to watch, but there's
about five images

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.570 align:middle line:90%
associated with every movie.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.590 align:middle line:84%
The image that you see, because
you have to click, oh, it's

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:16.410 align:middle line:90%
me watching.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.993 align:middle line:84%
If you have like five people in
your family, it's me watching.

00:15:18.993 --> 00:15:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, it will change
the image based

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.360 align:middle line:90%
upon what it thinks you like.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you're scrolling
on social media,

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and you're always clicking
Like, and especially doing that,

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.040 align:middle line:84%
stop, scroll back,
because you want

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.590 align:middle line:84%
to look at it, that means
it catches your eye.

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And that means Netflix
wants to use that.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And their algorithms
are incredible.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.000 align:middle line:84%
They can pretty much
predict what kind of image

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.390 align:middle line:84%
you would like to see to make
you most likely want to click

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.370 align:middle line:90%
that video and watch it.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the kind of
stuff that all that data

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.070 align:middle line:90%
is being propagated.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.920 align:middle line:84%
The security part of it
is, whose data is that?

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:55.930 align:middle line:90%
Who owns it?

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:56.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not mine.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:57.770 align:middle line:90%
I propagated it.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.370 align:middle line:84%
But like I said, it's
a very detailed survey.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And you hand it over to
private data aggregators.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And once data aggregators
have it, they own that.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.353 align:middle line:90%
You don't even get to see it.

00:16:10.353 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've
programmed it for them.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.010 align:middle line:90%
But they own it.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.765 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So let's just talk
a little bit about psychology.

00:16:15.765 --> 00:16:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Can you figure out
someone's psychology

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.698 align:middle line:84%
just by knowing what they
click through in social media?

00:16:21.698 --> 00:16:22.865 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To a large extent.

00:16:22.865 --> 00:16:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: You know a
lot of what they like.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.930 align:middle line:84%
You know the stuff
that catches their eye.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.910 align:middle line:84%
That says a lot about
the subconscious mind.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Then add Amazon to it.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah, add Amazon.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.970 align:middle line:84%
I would say the future of
Amazon is predictive shipping.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So they know that you
continually buy this product.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.380 align:middle line:84%
They're eventually just going
to start shipping it to you.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And if less than 5% of
that product is returned,

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:48.230 align:middle line:84%
they still make a nice profit,
so predictive shipping.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.340 align:middle line:90%
And some of these things--

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:84%
I think they're kind
of cool in theory.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:84%
But there's obviously
glaring things

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.753 align:middle line:90%
here that there's an issue with.

00:16:55.753 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and I think also--

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and we'll get back, again,
when we get back to quantum,

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:02.100 align:middle line:90%
the quantum interface there too.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.000 align:middle line:84%
One thing he did say
is, when you really

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.880 align:middle line:84%
have quantum computing
fully developed

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.970 align:middle line:84%
and fully in place,
there's almost no chance

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.130 align:middle line:90%
for cybersecurity.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:14.780 align:middle line:90%
You're ones and zeros.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.957 align:middle line:90%
It's like waves and particles.

00:17:17.957 --> 00:17:19.040 align:middle line:90%
There's no chance anymore.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.290 align:middle line:90%
We're off of ones and zeros, OK?

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.942 align:middle line:90%
And you really can't protect--

00:17:22.942 --> 00:17:24.900 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to go
back to that in a minute.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.433 align:middle line:84%
And I going to say, part of
this is generational too,

00:17:27.433 --> 00:17:29.600 align:middle line:84%
because if you grew up in
a generation like my dad's

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.870 align:middle line:84%
generation, you wrote a letter
to someone that was private.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:84%
You might even write
"confidential" on the envelope.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And you wanted
that person to have

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.840 align:middle line:90%
your private communication.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And no one else would
ever know about it.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And then you go
to my generation,

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.320 align:middle line:84%
which is the beginning of
the computer generation.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Still, you have private
phone conversations.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.420 align:middle line:90%
And you have private emails.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And your perception is that
you're just using technology

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.790 align:middle line:90%
to privately deliver.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Now we have a generation
of-- let's say the zoomers,

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.040 align:middle line:84%
for example, where
you have kids that

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:07.700 align:middle line:84%
are 15, 16 years old, where
private security and such--

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.960 align:middle line:90%
that isn't even a thought.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not a desire.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:15.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not even-- you
wouldn't understand

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.380 align:middle line:84%
why you would want to
have your life private,

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.950 align:middle line:84%
because you're happy
to share everything.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And the people developing
this technology are--

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and it's always going to be--
of the youngest generations,

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.340 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Totally, totally.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you bring
up a very good point,

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:35.020 align:middle line:84%
because I would say my
generation is one of the last

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:84%
that remembers a time
before the internet.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.023 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes, exactly.

00:18:39.023 --> 00:18:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And you know, I
would say the interesting thing

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.470 align:middle line:84%
about that is, you're
definitely right.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Generationally, we
have different ideas

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.860 align:middle line:90%
on like, what is private?

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.390 align:middle line:90%
What is security?

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.020 align:middle line:90%
What does it matter?

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.600 align:middle line:90%
And I think, in the future--

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and when I say future now, I
don't mean 100 years from now.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:59.980 align:middle line:84%
I could mean less
than 10 years now,

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.990 align:middle line:84%
because some of the technologies
that are coming up--

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:06.520 align:middle line:84%
and I think the best way to
research this is, go and find--

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.650 align:middle line:84%
you know all those
things on YouTube

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:84%
where you want to know
what stocks to purchase?

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's people like, well,
buy this newsletter and blah,

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:14.830 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Subscribe to that,
and I'll tell you

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:19.390 align:middle line:84%
who's going to be supplying
Apple with their RF chips

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:20.307 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:19:20.307 --> 00:19:22.390 align:middle line:84%
That's a great way to
research, because you really

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:23.590 align:middle line:90%
do find the companies.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:24.880 align:middle line:90%
And you can find the names.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And you can figure out what's
the push for coming technology.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:90%
And some of it--

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.138 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's all algorithm
traded, for the most part,

00:19:32.138 --> 00:19:33.430 align:middle line:90%
about 90%--

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:90%
it's algorithms.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah, absolutely.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But you get to find out what
technologies are coming.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.013 align:middle line:90%
And some of them--

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:41.680 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And so some of them-- and I'll
speak about a couple of them,

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.120 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
couple that actually

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.800 align:middle line:84%
get right back to maybe some
of the health concerns of 5G.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.147 align:middle line:84%
But let's say technology
like these glasses--

00:19:53.147 --> 00:19:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
watched "WestWorld"--

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: OK.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.930 align:middle line:84%
So these glasses
that they just have--

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.670 align:middle line:90%
it's like a heads-up display.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:03.147 align:middle line:84%
And whatever you're
looking at, it can see.

00:20:03.147 --> 00:20:04.480 align:middle line:90%
It knows what you're looking at.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And it can-- like
Terminator in the movie,

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.860 align:middle line:84%
it sends you back
useful information.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.510 align:middle line:90%
That's not sci-fi anymore.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.150 align:middle line:90%
This stuff is really here.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Facial recognition,
even with masks

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.640 align:middle line:90%
on nowadays, retinal scanning--

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I think
I heard this guy--

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.190 align:middle line:90%
I think his name is Tom Scott.

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about the latest
technology in search engines.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying that retinal
scanning technology is

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:30.460 align:middle line:84%
so incredible now at being
able to not only just

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.100 align:middle line:84%
identify who you are, even
if you have a mask on,

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.870 align:middle line:84%
and all it can see
from a distance,

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.650 align:middle line:84%
because cameras are
getting better, your eyes.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.798 align:middle line:84%
Not only is it IDing
you, but it can also--

00:20:41.798 --> 00:20:43.590 align:middle line:84%
do you know about
iridology and sclerology?

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.423 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I do.

00:20:44.423 --> 00:20:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: OK, so
for your audience,

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.270 align:middle line:84%
it's basically looking at
what's going on inside your body

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.460 align:middle line:90%
by looking at your eyes.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:57.670 align:middle line:84%
This technology is better
than 97% of the iridologists

00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.320 align:middle line:84%
and sclerologists
out there, being

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.020 align:middle line:84%
able to pick up on certain
patterns and things

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.050 align:middle line:84%
that these doctors who have
devoted their lives to that

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:06.530 align:middle line:90%
haven't been able to see.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So that technology
is getting better.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:13.510 align:middle line:84%
So we have that technology
now on glasses looking out

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.670 align:middle line:90%
and giving a heads-up display.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So now imagine-- just a
little thought experiment.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:22.210 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
quantum computers.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Real quick, quantum computing,
one of the best things about it

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:28.060 align:middle line:90%
is it builds models.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And then it kind
of maps out, what

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:33.090 align:middle line:84%
are the highest likelihoods
of things to happen?

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right?

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:34.555 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:21:34.555 --> 00:21:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
fabulous for modeling,

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.470 align:middle line:90%
because it operates so quickly.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:39.700 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, there's
also analog ways

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:84%
to do that as well that Rupert
Sheldrake talks about really

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.390 align:middle line:90%
beautifully.

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:52.480 align:middle line:84%
But now, just imagine, every
one of us, we have a core frame.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain just
tried-and-true things.

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Like, if I sit like
this, you can tell a lot

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.680 align:middle line:90%
about what's going on inside me.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.670 align:middle line:84%
If I'm very expanded, and I'm
like this, you can also tell.

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, now imagine what a
supercomputer can tell, right?

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.640 align:middle line:90%
And then that keeps advancing--

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.180 align:middle line:84%
what it would be able to tell
due to blinking patterns,

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.712 align:middle line:84%
swallowing patterns, facial
movements, even the slightest

00:22:16.712 --> 00:22:18.670 align:middle line:84%
ones, like cops are able
to tell whether you're

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.860 align:middle line:84%
lying if you look up and to the
left, or any of those things.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.320 align:middle line:84%
But now we have
computers doing it.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:90%
And they don't miss a thing.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.500 align:middle line:90%
They can see your body language.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.350 align:middle line:84%
They understand your
gait cycle, all of that.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine it
gets to the point

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.180 align:middle line:84%
where you're able to
wear a pair of glasses.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And really, it'll give
you a heads-up display.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.300 align:middle line:84%
What kind of emotional
state is this person in?

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.750 align:middle line:90%
What's the likelihood that--

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.100 align:middle line:90%
are they looking at me?

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:84%
What kind of state of arousal
or disinterest might they be in?

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.940 align:middle line:84%
A bunch of stuff
that I can't even

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.050 align:middle line:84%
give too much of a
thought experiment on.

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.990 align:middle line:84%
But eventually,
these search engines

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:59.510 align:middle line:84%
are able to draw out
correlations that humans can't,

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:middle line:90%
such as university professors--

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.770 align:middle line:84%
for the longest time,
they take resumes.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.030 align:middle line:90%
And then they accept some.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.670 align:middle line:90%
They push others off the table.

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And then now they're
automating that with AI.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And the AI is going
backwards in time

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.580 align:middle line:84%
and taking a look at,
well, to go forward,

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.620 align:middle line:84%
we want to use the
rearview mirrors

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and check out what resumes
worked in the past.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:24.930 align:middle line:90%
We'll start there.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
there's a large majority--

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.540 align:middle line:84%
women's resumes are
pushed to the side,

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.300 align:middle line:84%
and men's resumes are the
ones that are accepted.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that wouldn't

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.490 align:middle line:84%
have been found had it not been
for these supercomputers that

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:40.990 align:middle line:84%
are taking a look
and drawing patterns.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:44.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is getting back to
the security type of thing.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And what is privacy at that
point, if you can tell so much

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:90%
more about a person?

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is actually
kind of neat, you know?

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:55.410 align:middle line:84%
I know that people who are very
conservative in their ways,

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.000 align:middle line:84%
that they don't want things
to change that rapidly.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000 align:middle line:84%
We're moving into a world
where things are going

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.678 align:middle line:90%
to start a lot more rapidly.

00:24:01.678 --> 00:24:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You give up that one.

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:04.480 align:middle line:90%
It's already happened, yeah.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So what
does that mean?

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Like, there's not so
much that you can hide.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.900 align:middle line:90%
There's not as much.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you still
will be able to.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.830 align:middle line:90%
But then, at what point is--

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:16.540 align:middle line:84%
I can go online and find out
a lot about Regina Meredith.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: But in
20 years, I might

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:23.130 align:middle line:84%
be able to go online and find
exponentially more and just

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.740 align:middle line:84%
different arenas, not just
things that you've published

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.673 align:middle line:84%
or that have been
published around you.

00:24:27.673 --> 00:24:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest
things about this

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.650 align:middle line:84%
is, you notice how
TVs are becoming

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:32.990 align:middle line:90%
more and more like devices?

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:35.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the lines
are being blurred.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So even the commercials
that you see

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.640 align:middle line:84%
might be different than the
commercials I see on TV,

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.120 align:middle line:84%
not just scrolling through
Instagram, because we know--

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.660 align:middle line:84%
anyone who's paying attention
to these things, my Instagram

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:53.250 align:middle line:84%
feed-- even if we are following
the exact same people,

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.298 align:middle line:84%
my Instagram feed will
be different than yours.

00:24:55.298 --> 00:24:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just because of the
way you've swiped and so forth.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.302 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah, exactly.

00:24:59.302 --> 00:25:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's certain
things where--

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Britney Kaiser, who is
a whistleblower that

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.780 align:middle line:84%
worked at Cambridge Analytica,
that was basically-- she

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:11.190 align:middle line:84%
is there saying, I think
we should own our own data.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:13.432 align:middle line:90%
And in a sense, I agree.

00:25:13.432 --> 00:25:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How is that
even going to happen now?

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Oh, I
don't think it will.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's not
even a possibility.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And so she was saying
something where the way

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:25.770 align:middle line:84%
that ads are
targeted to people--

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and you can sure tell
by data whether somebody

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.700 align:middle line:84%
is an introvert or an
extrovert, because extroverts

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.430 align:middle line:84%
are taking selfies outside
all the time, right?

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:38.050 align:middle line:90%
All the places that they go.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:42.330 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, beyond that,
introverts are typically--

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:46.320 align:middle line:84%
so they're most likely
not going to be voting.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.440 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be what the
data speaks loudest on.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.080 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to vote as
much as the extroverts will.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.953 align:middle line:84%
So you make sure
they don't vote.

00:25:53.953 --> 00:25:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And you
send them conspiracy--

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: --paranoia pieces,
things that make them more

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.030 align:middle line:90%
fearful--

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cambridge
Analytica were

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.230 align:middle line:90%
very good at what they did.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Yeah, and there's
many others like that--

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Many, many other.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: --that have
disinformation and fake news

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:12.900 align:middle line:84%
as a service that you can
buy, which means millions

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.850 align:middle line:90%
of dollars going into media.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.390 align:middle line:90%
Where is that media?

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It's got
to be out there.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
advertise it as such

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.230 align:middle line:84%
but it's definitely
out there, meaning you

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:24.578 align:middle line:84%
and I have definitely seen
intentionally fake media.

00:26:24.578 --> 00:26:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: We all have.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.017 align:middle line:84%
It's just now
getting to the point

00:26:28.017 --> 00:26:29.850 align:middle line:84%
where it's harder and
harder to distinguish.

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And you remember those two
technologies I told you?

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.030 align:middle line:84%
One propagates the fake
data or the fake media.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:37.650 align:middle line:90%
And the other one tracks it.

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.168 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: There's a
lot of data on this.

00:26:40.168 --> 00:26:43.200 align:middle line:84%
One, the whole purpose of it
is to make it harder and harder

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.390 align:middle line:84%
to distinguish whether
it's real or fake.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.660 align:middle line:90%
And so the most widely shared--

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.970 align:middle line:84%
because you know, that's
how things become viral,

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:52.620 align:middle line:90%
is they're shared by people.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:56.400 align:middle line:84%
The most widely shared
is political media

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.505 align:middle line:84%
that leaves the audience
with either disgust or fear.

00:26:59.505 --> 00:27:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: That's the
most widely shared.

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:02.703 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that is addictive.

00:27:02.703 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:84%
That has effects on
your brain chemicals

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.330 align:middle line:84%
to make it
purposefully addictive.

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:84%
You're going to come
back for another dose.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:11.515 align:middle line:84%
It's monetizing the dopamine
pathway and several other ones.

00:27:11.515 --> 00:27:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And I think
that's pretty interesting.

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.340 align:middle line:84%
It also kind of-- it
always brings me back to,

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.020 align:middle line:90%
what is consciousness?

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.330 align:middle line:84%
What's going on with
these dopamine pathways

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.730 align:middle line:90%
and the serotonin pathways?

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And how are they triggered
from the outside?

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Because we know--

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Serotonin is
almost never triggered

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.060 align:middle line:90%
by politics, only dopamine.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right, right.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, even your phone.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And back in the day,
remember, you've got mail?

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: They were
tracking back then, dopamine,

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.380 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:40.188 align:middle line:84%
So over time, that
also changes you.

00:27:40.188 --> 00:27:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And it changes your
thought patterns.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.850 align:middle line:84%
It can even change
your attention span,

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:46.350 align:middle line:84%
these types of
things, which we know

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.690 align:middle line:90%
our attention span is shifting.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:49.740 align:middle line:90%
So that was introverts.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Extroverts are now--
they're the ones

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.380 align:middle line:84%
who are targeted with--
they're probably going to vote.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:59.250 align:middle line:84%
So they're given these happy,
outgoing, get involved,

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.770 align:middle line:84%
become a part of the
movement, donate to this,

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:05.080 align:middle line:84%
put your name on this petition,
all that kind of stuff.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.030 align:middle line:84%
So extroverts, divert
your attention here.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:10.450 align:middle line:90%
Don't just do whatever you want.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Divert.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Put that
energy somewhere.

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:13.365 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: So it's aikido.

00:28:13.365 --> 00:28:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Manipulate
them to replace-- yeah.

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: It's like aikido.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.160 align:middle line:84%
You take what's already the
momentum and their strengths.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And you just-- you frame
their conversations.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.920 align:middle line:84%
You keep them away from
certain conversations

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.350 align:middle line:84%
and just keep them right
here in this little box.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And the extroverts, the
ones who are probably

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.468 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more cynical and
don't buy a lot of the media--

00:28:31.468 --> 00:28:32.885 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mean
the introverts?

00:28:32.885 --> 00:28:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Oh, I'm sorry,
the introverts, yes.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:36.550 align:middle line:84%
The introverts--
they're probably

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:90%
more cynical, skeptical.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.930 align:middle line:84%
So they're just given paranoia
pieces to keep them away

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:42.340 align:middle line:90%
from the polls.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's fascinating,
the way you've put this.

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really appreciate
your describing this,

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:51.370 align:middle line:84%
because we're all seeing
how we're being played

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:53.703 align:middle line:84%
and how people around us are
responding to being played.

00:28:53.703 --> 00:28:55.203 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It's a
social experiment.

00:28:55.203 --> 00:28:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to me--
it's a social experiment

00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:59.860 align:middle line:84%
of a grotesque
nature, in my opinion.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think what-- and we'll
continue on with the 5G.

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.870 align:middle line:90%
But I just, I have to say this.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:07.300 align:middle line:84%
I think what bothers me
even more than the notion

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:12.940 align:middle line:84%
that privacy no longer exists,
which, I'm kind of old school.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.440 align:middle line:90%
And I'm an introvert.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's
none of your business.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't write
about myself and such,

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.190 align:middle line:84%
partly because it's
not that interesting.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:24.220 align:middle line:84%
But I like having
my little world.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.220 align:middle line:84%
But all this data that you can
find on the internet-- that's

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.330 align:middle line:90%
one thing.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:32.200 align:middle line:84%
The notion of being manipulated
and the cognitive dissonance

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.230 align:middle line:84%
that is creating these
pathways of hatred and anger

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.990 align:middle line:84%
among people and pitting
them against each other,

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:41.570 align:middle line:84%
locally in families, all the
way out to country to country--

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:45.760 align:middle line:84%
now, that is something that
I'm very concerned about,

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.520 align:middle line:84%
because I can't see
how we can stop it,

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.750 align:middle line:84%
unless each person goes
away from technology

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and goes into their internal
technology of consciousness

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:59.650 align:middle line:84%
to start truly developing
discernment, so you

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:01.400 align:middle line:90%
know that's a fraud.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.200 align:middle line:90%
I feel it.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.000 align:middle line:90%
I know it.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.030 align:middle line:84%
That's a fraud-- because the
mechanism and the tuning fork

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:09.220 align:middle line:84%
of the multidimensional
human being

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.002 align:middle line:84%
is still more
sophisticated than AI.

00:30:12.002 --> 00:30:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: It will always be.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:14.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it always will be.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's organic.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.870 align:middle line:90%
And it comes with us.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:18.730 align:middle line:84%
It comes with the
spirit, the soul.

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:20.785 align:middle line:84%
It's all interconnected
with the all.

00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:26.110 align:middle line:84%
To have access to that, to be
able to quiet down and say, no.

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:27.820 align:middle line:90%
OK, surveil me all you want.

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.800 align:middle line:84%
But you're not going
to manipulate me.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:33.310 align:middle line:84%
That is really, I think, what
most people watching this

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:34.870 align:middle line:90%
are even more concerned about.

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:37.330 align:middle line:10%
And so to empower
those people, I

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:40.630 align:middle line:10%
think what's really important
is to also understand,

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.000 align:middle line:10%
OK, I still use my phone.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.440 align:middle line:90%
I still go on social media.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.380 align:middle line:90%
It's part of my life.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.180 align:middle line:90%
But there--

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do too, for work.

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's things that
you can do to safeguard.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
number-one things that I had

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.870 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:middle line:84%
I personally had to come
to the understanding

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.930 align:middle line:84%
of is, when there's fake media
out there, which there is.

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:00.790 align:middle line:90%
It's already been established.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:03.648 align:middle line:90%
It's not-- I think--

00:31:03.648 --> 00:31:05.440 align:middle line:84%
have you ever heard
people say, like, well,

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.363 align:middle line:90%
TV can brainwash you.

00:31:06.363 --> 00:31:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And people are
like, well, I don't

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.040 align:middle line:84%
get brainwashed by ads
and stuff like that.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.863 align:middle line:84%
And for the most
part, some people--

00:31:11.863 --> 00:31:13.405 align:middle line:84%
you know you're
being sold something.

00:31:13.405 --> 00:31:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some are more
susceptible than others, true.

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.210 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
deeper layers of it

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:23.350 align:middle line:84%
is the way that it
frames our conversations.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
fake media is there

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:29.890 align:middle line:84%
to get us to believe what the
media itself is talking about,

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:32.260 align:middle line:90%
the specific information.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:36.580 align:middle line:84%
What it is is it's opening
up questions inside our mind.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And the mind doesn't
like not having closure.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
where it's bumping up

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.230 align:middle line:90%
against cognitive dissonance.

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:42.430 align:middle line:90%
You're saying, hold on.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:43.900 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't make sense.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.100 align:middle line:90%
It feels wrong.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And yet you're saying all this
data exists to support this?

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.460 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.100 align:middle line:84%
That does create a more
probing mind if you're awake.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Mhm.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:57.700 align:middle line:84%
So there's this one thing that
was published by the NIH and--

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.590 align:middle line:84%
the National
Institute of Health--

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.865 align:middle line:84%
and also on PubMed,
which, you can

00:32:01.865 --> 00:32:03.115 align:middle line:90%
get a lot of things on PubMed.

00:32:03.115 --> 00:32:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's
a good resource.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It's
a great resource.

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:10.090 align:middle line:84%
But there was this
one that said,

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:15.430 align:middle line:84%
5G technology induces
coronaviruses in skin cells.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was taken down
within five days.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: It was retracted.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: There were seven--

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I think it was seven or
eight reputable scientists

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and doctors from
different countries.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:30.280 align:middle line:84%
The main editor
was out of Italy--

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Fioranelli, I think,
was his name--

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:36.340 align:middle line:90%
Massimo Fioranelli.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.490 align:middle line:90%
And it was retracted.

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.720 align:middle line:90%
But it got shared very heavily.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.210 align:middle line:90%
So I was already onto this.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:44.920 align:middle line:90%
What gets shared?

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.750 align:middle line:90%
How quickly does it get shared?

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So I was thinking, OK, beyond,
does 5G induce coronaviruses?

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Because there's mixed
reviews across the board.

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:58.930 align:middle line:84%
There's intelligent people on
both sides talking about that.

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:00.780 align:middle line:90%
I can't say that I--

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't buy it.

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:06.220 align:middle line:84%
But I always leave a little
room for just in case,

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.740 align:middle line:84%
because I don't have the
credentials to really say

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:09.567 align:middle line:90%
yes or no.

00:33:09.567 --> 00:33:11.650 align:middle line:84%
But I'm always looking at,
what's the bigger play?

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:12.872 align:middle line:90%
I try and remove myself.

00:33:12.872 --> 00:33:14.080 align:middle line:90%
That framed the conversation.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is this
shoving you toward?

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:16.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So we know that
there's a race towards 5G.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:19.660 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:25.908 align:middle line:84%
And we know that years
ago, there was talk--

00:33:25.908 --> 00:33:27.700 align:middle line:84%
actually, nine years
ago, they were already

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.280 align:middle line:84%
talking about 5G and
what it's going to be,

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:33.310 align:middle line:84%
and that China is
ahead of the US.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And then we also know that
$300 billion was put--

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:43.150 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese put $300 billion
into basically planting people

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:47.170 align:middle line:84%
inside US semiconductor
companies to, in a sense,

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:48.555 align:middle line:90%
take that technology--

00:33:48.555 --> 00:33:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Espionage,
industrial espionage.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.587 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Yeah, take that
technology back to China.

00:33:51.587 --> 00:33:53.260 align:middle line:90%
They can reproduce it.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.840 align:middle line:90%
So why this thing on PubMed?

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.340 align:middle line:90%
It got very widely shared.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.480 align:middle line:90%
It was retracted.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Everyone took their hands
off it, even the scientists.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.857 align:middle line:84%
Most of them were like, it
was taken out of context.

00:34:04.857 --> 00:34:06.190 align:middle line:90%
They took their hands off of it.

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:07.820 align:middle line:90%
OK, end of that story.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.610 align:middle line:90%
But it got widely shared.

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And what does that do
for most people who

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.250 align:middle line:84%
don't do researching,
and they don't look--

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:18.310 align:middle line:84%
most media sources, you
need at least two sources

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:20.800 align:middle line:90%
to verify something.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.679 align:middle line:90%
And most people don't do that.

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:24.880 align:middle line:90%
They see a meme.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.870 align:middle line:90%
It makes enough sense to them.

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:29.590 align:middle line:84%
It validates maybe some of
their biases and beliefs.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And they just-- it anchors
it deeper inside them.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.940 align:middle line:84%
So I think, like,
was this to slow down

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.670 align:middle line:84%
5G development in
certain countries

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:42.760 align:middle line:84%
that might be potential
competitors for China,

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.170 align:middle line:90%
or the other way around?

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Because these tactics--
you have to imagine,

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.909 align:middle line:84%
if I can think of that,
it's been thought of before.

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:50.409 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, as soon as you--

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:52.929 align:middle line:84%
if you're a discerning
thinker, first thing you do

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:55.817 align:middle line:84%
is notice where your emotions
have just been driven.

00:34:55.817 --> 00:34:58.150 align:middle line:84%
That's going to give you a
lot of key data right there--

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.850 align:middle line:84%
your emotion, how you
feel, like, oh my god.

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:02.170 align:middle line:90%
There's your data right there.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Then you can kind of guess where
you're being engineered to go.

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:06.190 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:07.060 align:middle line:90%
Do I trust it?

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:08.655 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: That's all you
got to get people to think.

00:35:08.655 --> 00:35:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.127 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So yeah, you can
retract it all you want.

00:35:11.127 --> 00:35:13.420 align:middle line:84%
But the seed has been
put into people's head.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's been
laid down, yeah.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.545 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And people are just--
because most people don't even

00:35:17.545 --> 00:35:19.330 align:middle line:90%
know that it was retracted.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:21.700 align:middle line:84%
The ones who've
shared it very widely,

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.710 align:middle line:84%
they don't even know
that it was retracted.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:26.740 align:middle line:84%
They're just sitting there
with this idea in their head.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Should I trust 5G?

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And 5G isn't just
one thing, you know?

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.280 align:middle line:90%
It's millimeter waves, yes.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.690 align:middle line:90%
That's the new addition.

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:38.890 align:middle line:84%
But 5G is also 4G, because
it's those big towers that

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:42.040 align:middle line:84%
have longer slow waves that
can penetrate these walls.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.250 align:middle line:84%
The reason why you're going to
need a bunch of small 5G masts

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:48.820 align:middle line:84%
and towers everywhere is because
it doesn't travel that far.

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And it also, if it rains, it
gets absorbed into the rain.

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:54.130 align:middle line:84%
If there's trees
in the way, it gets

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:57.550 align:middle line:84%
absorbed into the shallow
tissues of the trees, animals,

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:59.710 align:middle line:90%
insects, and yes, in humans.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:00.610 align:middle line:90%
It's shown.

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's three-- actually,
four types of tissue

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:07.810 align:middle line:84%
in our body that get
affected the most by EMFs--

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:10.870 align:middle line:84%
the brain, the heart,
reproductive organs,

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.260 align:middle line:90%
and the fascia.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.510 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty much everything.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:14.885 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's everything

00:36:14.885 --> 00:36:17.090 align:middle line:84%
we need for a good life,
or to propogate life, even.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:17.890 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Exactly.

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:21.190 align:middle line:84%
The top and the bottom of
the spinal column, and then

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:25.750 align:middle line:84%
all of our fascia coalesces
around the craniosacral pump.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And so fascia is the
most interconnected organ

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.670 align:middle line:90%
inside the body.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.020 align:middle line:90%
It's intelligent.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.390 align:middle line:84%
It actually-- if something
grazes your foot,

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:36.490 align:middle line:84%
and you react
really quick, you've

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:39.430 align:middle line:84%
reacted quicker than the
signal can get to your brain,

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:42.460 align:middle line:84%
because your nervous system
runs at about 250 miles an hour,

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:43.630 align:middle line:90%
like a Ferrari.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:47.560 align:middle line:84%
But your fascia, especially when
in good health, is fiberoptic.

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So it it's a lot
quicker than that.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: And so with that--

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Without
being affected.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:54.790 align:middle line:90%
And these tissues seem--

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:56.470 align:middle line:84%
that's where it
gets absorbed into.

00:36:56.470 --> 00:37:00.040 align:middle line:84%
So back to the point,
you need tons more masts,

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.920 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
penetrating deeply enough.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.930 align:middle line:90%
But we're still using 4G.

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:09.130 align:middle line:84%
So now, not only do we have
100,000 times faster internet,

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:11.860 align:middle line:84%
at least 100,000
times more EMFs.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And as of 4G, we had 100 million
times more EMFs than 100--

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:22.010 align:middle line:84%
well, actually, than even
60, 70 years prior to that.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:24.070 align:middle line:90%
So we're talking, now, this is--

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How fast can
our biology evolve--

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Adapt.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:29.967 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to be
able to adapt to this?

00:37:29.967 --> 00:37:31.433 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's a big question.

00:37:31.433 --> 00:37:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to toss to
another little factor in there,

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:35.267 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
think it's little.

00:37:35.267 --> 00:37:37.390 align:middle line:90%


00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Klinghoffer's work--
Dr. Klinghoffer's work--

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I know that name.

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He is
an MD from Germany

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:45.640 align:middle line:90%
who lives in the US right now.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.257 align:middle line:84%
But I remember him talking
about his metals analysis

00:37:48.257 --> 00:37:49.840 align:middle line:84%
in the human body,
because he's really

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.800 align:middle line:84%
big on detoxing, talking about,
in America in particular,

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.740 align:middle line:84%
more so than the rest of
the world, but everywhere,

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:59.800 align:middle line:84%
because of con- and
chemtrails, both,

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:04.840 align:middle line:84%
we all have high, far higher
than normal levels of aluminum

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.090 align:middle line:84%
in particular in our
bodies and brains.

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Now these very, very short
waves, these frequencies,

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:12.870 align:middle line:84%
are always interacting
with metals.

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.660 align:middle line:84%
So what is happening there,
where our bodies become-- these

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:19.140 align:middle line:84%
become like mini-antennae
on a cellular level,

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.900 align:middle line:84%
where this garbage is
trapped in our bodies.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Then what happens when
you're looking at us also

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:26.540 align:middle line:84%
as a metallic antenna
for all of this?

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:31.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a much bigger play,
I think, with all of this

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:32.730 align:middle line:90%
at hand.

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:35.550 align:middle line:84%
But just to stick
with that, yes, we

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:37.350 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of heavy
metals inside of us.

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:38.740 align:middle line:90%
Aluminum is just one of them.

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Our brains and
the rest of our bodies.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And so we have this
brilliant natural thing

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:45.450 align:middle line:84%
called the blood-brain
barrier that's

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:49.090 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be able to keep
things out of the brain.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:52.140 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that
has been found with EMFs

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.358 align:middle line:90%
is it causes a leak--

00:38:53.358 --> 00:38:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
barrier, absolutely.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:56.108 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: --in that barrier.

00:38:56.108 --> 00:38:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And so that causes a
whole host of issues,

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:03.150 align:middle line:84%
but one of them being,
anything toxic inside your body

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:05.260 align:middle line:90%
now has access into the brain.

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So that's
just one of the things.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Another one of the things
that's happening is with EMFs--

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.952 align:middle line:84%
and that's-- it's
not just phones.

00:39:14.952 --> 00:39:16.410 align:middle line:84%
We're talking,
like, you could have

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:18.748 align:middle line:84%
faulty wiring, dirty
electricity in your house.

00:39:18.748 --> 00:39:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Routers and so forth.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And magnetic fields are
actually even worse,

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.110 align:middle line:84%
because they're
harder to shield from.

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:28.990 align:middle line:84%
There's Faraday fabric that
you can put your phone inside.

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:30.163 align:middle line:90%
It won't receive a signal.

00:39:30.163 --> 00:39:31.830 align:middle line:84%
But you can put a
magnet inside of that,

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:33.910 align:middle line:84%
and it'll still hold on
the other side of it.

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:36.630 align:middle line:84%
So magnetic fields are
also pretty damaging.

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:39.240 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that it does
inside the body, which

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.450 align:middle line:84%
causes a whole host of
downstream effects, is it

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:47.460 align:middle line:84%
opens the VGCC, Voltage-Gated
Calcium Channels on our cells.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Those aren't supposed to
be as active as they are.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:52.720 align:middle line:90%
EMFs chronically open them.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.510 align:middle line:84%
So that means there
is an overloading

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:56.560 align:middle line:90%
of calcium inside the cells.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.010 align:middle line:84%
There's also nitric oxide
that's being ignited

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:01.020 align:middle line:84%
inside the cells, which,
that's only supposed

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.280 align:middle line:90%
to happen outside of the cells.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.130 align:middle line:90%
So there's a bunch of--

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:07.620 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say
anti-evolutionary, but like,

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:10.020 align:middle line:84%
evolution didn't prepare us
for these kinds of things.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not beneficial for
cellular health of any kind.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Definitely not.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.210 align:middle line:90%
And there are solutions.

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Thank goodness, there
are some solutions.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's-- because
now everybody's like, holy cow,

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.050 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:23.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's go into that.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at some
of the solutions.

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at some of the
brilliant innovations.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And then let's look
at the human capacity,

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.170 align:middle line:84%
our natural human capacity
to adapt, to evolve,

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.900 align:middle line:84%
to be able to shift
frequency ranges, et cetera.

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.820 align:middle line:84%
So take it away on some
of the things you're

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:43.290 align:middle line:84%
finding the most exciting
by ways of potential

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:46.270 align:middle line:84%
remedying of these
nasty effects.

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: OK.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'll start with just
going back to what you said.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.850 align:middle line:84%
We are the most
advanced technology.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, we
haven't woken to that yet.

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.950 align:middle line:84%
That's why you keep hearing,
like, we need to wake up.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:00.742 align:middle line:84%
But most people don't
know what that means.

00:41:00.742 --> 00:41:01.650 align:middle line:90%
To what?

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Usually, they think you need
to wake up to the outside world

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.630 align:middle line:84%
stimuli and then come to
some inner conclusion.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:11.610 align:middle line:84%
But we-- all of
evolution, really,

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:13.530 align:middle line:84%
if you're looking at
it in this context,

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:15.840 align:middle line:90%
there's environmental stressors.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And we're meant to
be able to adapt

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:18.900 align:middle line:90%
to environmental stressors.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, just from
volcanoes, and the dust,

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and all of the metals
fallout from that.

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.960 align:middle line:90%
We've been doing this forever.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:25.960 align:middle line:90%
Drought--

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Drought, yeah.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It used to be very
lush, and now it's drought.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And Robert Sapolsky
talks about-- you'll

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:34.170 align:middle line:90%
have codes in your DNA.

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.360 align:middle line:84%
But it'll intentionally
mutate itself

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.300 align:middle line:84%
to start going towards, what
can we do that will actually

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.370 align:middle line:90%
adapt well to this stressor?

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:45.087 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, this
stressor-- we at least--

00:41:45.087 --> 00:41:47.510 align:middle line:84%
we're now identifying
what it is.

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:49.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we don't
know what this stressor is.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:54.270 align:middle line:84%
It just happens to be something
that is propagating so quickly.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And let me just say that
the safety guidelines

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.940 align:middle line:90%
for telecommunications--

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Martin Paul is
basically saying, don't even

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:07.290 align:middle line:84%
bother with it, because the only
thing that they're looking at

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:09.715 align:middle line:84%
are the thermal effects for
the nonionizing radiation.

00:42:09.715 --> 00:42:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The rest
is not even studied.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:12.798 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It's
not even looked at.

00:42:12.798 --> 00:42:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And so you know your phone
is nonionizing radiation.

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:18.363 align:middle line:90%
Chernobyl, that's ionizing.

00:42:18.363 --> 00:42:19.530 align:middle line:90%
So they're like, well, look.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:20.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not like Chernobyl.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.910 align:middle line:90%
You're fine.

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:23.730 align:middle line:90%
But we still are--

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:25.020 align:middle line:90%
we still set limits.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're way
above those limits.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Especially in the US, we're
way above those limits.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:32.700 align:middle line:84%
So now that I've properly
freaked out your audience--

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:34.492 align:middle line:84%
they probably are very
well versed in this.

00:42:34.492 --> 00:42:36.908 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Already freaked out
anyway, but you just helped.

00:42:36.908 --> 00:42:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:42.810 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
innate thing inside us

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:44.400 align:middle line:90%
that allows us to adapt.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.440 align:middle line:84%
But the things that
help it are the things

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.860 align:middle line:84%
that have always helped
us-- a good night's sleep.

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:52.440 align:middle line:84%
You can go out and
get bombarded by EMFs.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's still going to
have an effect on you.

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:57.990 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to massively
mitigate that effect,

00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:00.360 align:middle line:90%
shield your sleeping quarters.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you get a great eight
hours' sleep with the least

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:06.542 align:middle line:90%
amount of EMFs--

00:43:06.542 --> 00:43:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interference.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART:
--interference at all.

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.920 align:middle line:90%
Even light and stuff like that--

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.600 align:middle line:84%
like, when you're staring
at your phone too late,

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:16.840 align:middle line:84%
the blue light
blocks the melatonin.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.630 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to be getting
into the deep, restorative

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:20.900 align:middle line:90%
layers of sleep.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.980 align:middle line:90%
So shield your bed.

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.280 align:middle line:84%
There's these netting
things, Faraday

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.420 align:middle line:84%
cages that you can
put around your bed.

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.340 align:middle line:90%
That'll block EMFs.

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But it won't really
block magnetic waves.

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's also, the Earth
gives off magnetic waves.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:38.543 align:middle line:90%
So you also--

00:43:38.543 --> 00:43:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The cosmos
gives off magnetic waves.

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.585 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: The cosmos does.

00:43:41.585 --> 00:43:45.910 align:middle line:84%
But when the Earth
generates it, we've

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:48.860 align:middle line:84%
been dealing with that
for a long, long time.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's still smart to--
if you have a house,

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:54.310 align:middle line:84%
the wiring could
cause the problem.

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Your outlets-- if
you have something

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:58.962 align:middle line:84%
plugged into the wall,
even just unplugging it,

00:43:58.962 --> 00:44:00.170 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't take care of it.

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:02.003 align:middle line:84%
So there's many things
that-- unfortunately,

00:44:02.003 --> 00:44:05.410 align:middle line:84%
it's cost prohibitive to
buy this Faraday caging,

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:07.100 align:middle line:90%
Faraday paint--

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.920 align:middle line:90%
and this is all EMF shielding.

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.477 align:middle line:84%
And then you got to block
your windows and everything.

00:44:11.477 --> 00:44:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
these things that you

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.740 align:middle line:90%
can plug into the outlets--

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like David
Stetzer's work, for example.

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Yeah,
and Brian Hoyer.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.590 align:middle line:84%
He has a lot of really
good info out there.

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:22.870 align:middle line:84%
He actually came to Gaia
when I was working here

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and showed me exactly
where these lines were.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, OK,
Ben, your desk,

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:28.690 align:middle line:90%
you need to stand right here.

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:30.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's your optimal spot.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.430 align:middle line:90%
So it can be done.

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:34.510 align:middle line:84%
You need RF meters,
magnetic meters.

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And you need somebody who
knows what they're looking at,

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.760 align:middle line:84%
because there's even
shielding for your phones.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.340 align:middle line:84%
But if you do it wrong,
you're actually--

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:44.350 align:middle line:84%
so there's these
shields that it can

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:47.560 align:middle line:84%
shield 90% of the EMFs
coming at you if you

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.060 align:middle line:90%
have the cover closed.

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:52.090 align:middle line:84%
If you take the cover off, and
you put both on the back side,

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:54.018 align:middle line:84%
and the phone is facing
you, then now you're--

00:44:54.018 --> 00:44:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You amplify it?

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:55.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:55.450 --> 00:44:57.265 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: You're magnifying
it at least by two times.

00:44:57.265 --> 00:44:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, jeez.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.813 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So you really have
to know what you're doing.

00:45:00.813 --> 00:45:02.860 align:middle line:84%
That's why studying
it is perfect.

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Number one, you want to
shield it as much as possible.

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Number two, you want to
get a great night's sleep,

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:12.190 align:middle line:90%
shielded night's sleep.

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Here are the supplements that we
could probably be taking that,

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:16.750 align:middle line:90%
even if it weren't for EMFs--

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Though we're not
making any recommendations

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:19.030 align:middle line:90%
to anyone, of course.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: No, and
I'm not going to--

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
not medical advice.

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Exactly.

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:21.820 align:middle line:90%
Not medical advice.

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you can talk
about what you take and enjoy.

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:25.007 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I'll
just tell you what

00:45:25.007 --> 00:45:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Joseph Mercola has said.

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:30.580 align:middle line:84%
He talks about
magnesium, 400 milligrams

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.010 align:middle line:84%
of elemental magnesium,
because sometimes you'll

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:34.810 align:middle line:84%
have 400 milligrams
of magnesium,

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:39.230 align:middle line:84%
but only 256
elemental milligrams.

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:41.920 align:middle line:84%
So magnesium--
we're all deficient.

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So we really need to be
supplementing with that.

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Iodine-- you really
got to be careful.

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.250 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to overdo iodine.

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:50.788 align:middle line:90%
Niacin is another one.

00:45:50.788 --> 00:45:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is another one you

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:53.517 align:middle line:90%
have to be careful with too.

00:45:53.517 --> 00:45:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: You can get
that niacin flush for sure.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:59.050 align:middle line:90%
Hydrogen, actually.

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:00.250 align:middle line:90%
And you can get--

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:04.090 align:middle line:84%
I think it's elemental hydrogen.
I haven't studied that enough.

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:07.008 align:middle line:84%
And I don't understand if
that's for the Nrf2 pathway.

00:46:07.008 --> 00:46:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I don't either.

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:09.790 align:middle line:84%
I was even wondering
if that crosses over

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:11.330 align:middle line:90%
with Patrick Flanagan's work.

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Maybe.

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know, his Mg/H.

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Oh yeah.

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But I don't know.

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:17.918 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the answer.

00:46:17.918 --> 00:46:19.960 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering if that
might cross over to that.

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Research
never stops for me.

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'll definitely
look into that.

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Check it out.

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.500 align:middle line:90%
Let us know.

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And so those are the things
we really want to do.

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I stress
magnesium specifically

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:32.170 align:middle line:84%
is because, remember
when I said,

00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:35.230 align:middle line:84%
EMFs, they open up the
voltage-gated calcium channels?

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Magnesium can stop that chronic
opening of these channels.

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:42.370 align:middle line:84%
So getting enough
magnesium will stop it

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:46.690 align:middle line:84%
from creating all those
downstream effects.

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Simple things like the
antioxidants in blackberries,

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.020 align:middle line:84%
raspberries, strawberries
are really good.

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Cruciferous vegetables--
broccoli is really good.

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's just-- I would say,
anyone who you want to learn

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:03.130 align:middle line:84%
more about these things, go
to Dr. Joseph Mercola's book,

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:04.660 align:middle line:90%
"EMF*D."

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:05.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a really good book.

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And he goes through just
the whole history of it.

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Basically, when he's
talking about solutions,

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.260 align:middle line:84%
he's talking about
those ones specifically.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:19.480 align:middle line:84%
But he's also saying, we need to
get active, because none of it

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:20.668 align:middle line:90%
takes care of the problem.

00:47:20.668 --> 00:47:22.210 align:middle line:84%
All of it just
mitigates the problem.

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:23.502 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It just mitigates it.

00:47:23.502 --> 00:47:26.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, we have a couple of
things to talk about here.

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So people say-- and
I know they were

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.130 align:middle line:84%
able to do this in some of
the Marin County communities,

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:31.750 align:middle line:90%
and Brussels, and Switzerland.

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:34.720 align:middle line:84%
But by and large, people
feel totally defeated

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.310 align:middle line:84%
at going against their local
councils and saying, look,

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:38.980 align:middle line:90%
we don't want that in our town.

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:39.890 align:middle line:90%
How do you even--

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:40.690 align:middle line:90%
do you have--

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:43.810 align:middle line:84%
A, do you have any words
of wisdom or soothing

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:47.080 align:middle line:84%
words for people who are just
feeling devastated over that?

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, I want to get
into some of the breakthrough

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:52.990 align:middle line:84%
technologies that can
actually take that signal

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and enhance it into
something beneficial.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:56.590 align:middle line:90%
We'll end on that.

00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:58.490 align:middle line:84%
First of all, activism,
then benefits.

00:47:58.490 --> 00:47:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: OK.

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, when it comes
to activism, I

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:06.050 align:middle line:84%
think it's a very important
thing that we need to do.

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:11.140 align:middle line:84%
We also need to be honest about
how much efficacy certain forms

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:12.540 align:middle line:90%
of activism actually have.

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:16.620 align:middle line:84%
But to tell you
the truth, I think

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.900 align:middle line:84%
I heard of a couple
places, Connecticut

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.540 align:middle line:84%
being one, that
started pushing back

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:27.090 align:middle line:84%
against the massive
influx of 5G technology.

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And specifically, I think one
of the biggest parts of it was--

00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:33.270 align:middle line:84%
actually, and I'll
give you one--

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:36.900 align:middle line:84%
the audience one big piece
of hope right after this.

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:38.790 align:middle line:84%
But housing prices
are going down

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:43.740 align:middle line:84%
in certain areas because of
all these masts that now,

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:46.860 align:middle line:84%
if you own a house
that's right next to one,

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.750 align:middle line:90%
housing prices are going down.

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:51.360 align:middle line:84%
It's already started to
happen, because if anyone

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.920 align:middle line:84%
is paying attention,
these towers

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:54.230 align:middle line:90%
are going up like gangbusters.

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:55.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are.

00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.920 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Can't say it's related.

00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:01.170 align:middle line:84%
But in San Francisco, which
is one of the big 5G cities,

00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:03.948 align:middle line:84%
housing prices are dropping
rather precipitously,

00:49:03.948 --> 00:49:05.740 align:middle line:84%
considering the fact
that it was considered

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:06.853 align:middle line:90%
bulletproof two years ago.

00:49:06.853 --> 00:49:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:09.687 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I don't
know if they're related.

00:49:09.687 --> 00:49:11.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying, it's an issue.

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It's
worth looking at.

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:13.813 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also a lot
of churches, for example,

00:49:13.813 --> 00:49:16.260 align:middle line:90%
will rent out their roof space.

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Schools, institutions
that need money,

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:22.530 align:middle line:84%
are renting out their
rooftop in order

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:24.750 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have a
little passive income

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:25.823 align:middle line:90%
to support these things.

00:49:25.823 --> 00:49:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I won't
name any names.

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.870 align:middle line:84%
But there are certain
quite wealthy people

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:35.547 align:middle line:84%
that have actually exempted
their property, like hundreds

00:49:35.547 --> 00:49:36.630 align:middle line:90%
if not thousands of acres.

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I'm not even
remotely surprised at that.

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Right, so exempted
their property from any 5G

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.400 align:middle line:90%
technology whatsoever.

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.010 align:middle line:84%
The other very exciting
thing-- and this was also--

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Joseph Mercola
talked about this.

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And then I went and I
studied it right afterwards.

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:52.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Big insurance companies might
actually come to the aid,

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.327 align:middle line:90%
because they started--

00:49:57.327 --> 00:49:59.160 align:middle line:84%
which is funny, because
insurance companies,

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.788 align:middle line:90%
usually you're like, ugh.

00:50:00.788 --> 00:50:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but
they don't like claims.

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And that's exactly
what the beauty of this is,

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:09.630 align:middle line:90%
because there was a couple--

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:12.510 align:middle line:84%
basically, they stopped
with a bunch of the bigger

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:17.280 align:middle line:84%
industry saying, we're not
going to cover EMF-related harm.

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.130 align:middle line:90%
And so that's actually causing--

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:22.710 align:middle line:84%
what's beautiful about that is,
when we're talking about 5G,

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and faster internet,
and stuff like that,

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:28.920 align:middle line:84%
if you take away the way
that it's being done,

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and you just get the benefit of
faster and better technology,

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:33.840 align:middle line:90%
that's kind of cool.

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:34.850 align:middle line:90%
You know, I like that.

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:36.840 align:middle line:84%
I also like getting
away from technology.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even
get into Apple-Fi,

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.120 align:middle line:90%
if you know what that is.

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.037 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I don't.

00:50:43.037 --> 00:50:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, Apple was
looking at making $4.99

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:49.710 align:middle line:84%
direct-to-consumer,
anyone who has an iPhone,

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:53.340 align:middle line:84%
they have their own
wireless, no infrastructure

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:54.690 align:middle line:90%
built on Planet Earth.

00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:56.580 align:middle line:90%
It's all up in the satellites.

00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:58.500 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to be
sending satellites up.

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.750 align:middle line:84%
So they're probably
partnering with someone

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:03.375 align:middle line:84%
who's sending thousands and
thousands of satellites up.

00:51:03.375 --> 00:51:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tesla and others.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:05.545 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Starlink, exactly.

00:51:05.545 --> 00:51:06.545 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:51:06.545 --> 00:51:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: 14,000
satellites going up

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:09.970 align:middle line:90%
over the next few years.

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:12.900 align:middle line:84%
There's already, I think,
3,000, 4,000 up there already,

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:13.920 align:middle line:90%
so partnering with that.

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.960 align:middle line:90%
And that might be good.

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.340 align:middle line:84%
It might be good,
because they're

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:19.900 align:middle line:84%
using beamforming technology,
if you know what that is.

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:20.700 align:middle line:90%
So it's not--

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't understand
beamforming technology, really.

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:24.392 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Here's super simple.

00:51:24.392 --> 00:51:27.210 align:middle line:90%
Here's a tower, 4G.

00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:29.040 align:middle line:90%
Its beacon goes everywhere.

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.600 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't discriminate.

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.840 align:middle line:84%
5G towers, they have
beamforming to where

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:37.260 align:middle line:84%
you could be two miles
away-- well, not with 5G.

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.720 align:middle line:84%
You could be, let's say,
like half a mile away.

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And it will send a
message directly to you.

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:45.060 align:middle line:84%
It'll geolocate you, and it'll
send a message directly to you.

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.365 align:middle line:84%
But that message is
not going everywhere.

00:51:46.365 --> 00:51:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
like scattershot, OK.

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: That's the
technology with Apple-Fi

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.557 align:middle line:84%
that they're probably
going to be using.

00:51:51.557 --> 00:51:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Still kind of interesting,
though, because where's

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:54.690 align:middle line:90%
our sovereignty?

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:56.790 align:middle line:84%
If there's thousands of
5G satellites up there,

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:59.040 align:middle line:84%
you can't even go into the
middle of the Pacific Ocean

00:51:59.040 --> 00:51:59.890 align:middle line:90%
to get away from it.

00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So where's our
retreat from this?

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:05.200 align:middle line:84%
You can't just run off
into the mountains.

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.840 align:middle line:84%
We're never going
to stop technology.

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Technology began before
humans, actually.

00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you start with humans,
then language is a technology--

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.850 align:middle line:84%
all those old cave drawings
and things like that.

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:21.060 align:middle line:84%
We can theorize what
people were doing

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:23.680 align:middle line:84%
70,000 years ago because of
that technology that they

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:24.480 align:middle line:90%
discovered.

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.990 align:middle line:90%
They drew it out for us.

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So we're not going
to stop technology.

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.340 align:middle line:90%
I want to be very clear.

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:34.560 align:middle line:84%
I love advancing
technology, because I

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.150 align:middle line:90%
know how to stay in my center.

00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's key.

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.272 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And I know
when it's time for me

00:52:38.272 --> 00:52:39.480 align:middle line:90%
to put the technology down.

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:41.160 align:middle line:90%
So we need to meet it halfway.

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And when we're talking
about activism,

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:44.790 align:middle line:84%
it's very important
to get engaged

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:46.140 align:middle line:90%
with that outside world.

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:48.180 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not coming
home and doing things

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:51.330 align:middle line:84%
like meditating and getting
right with you-- and these

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:53.760 align:middle line:84%
are some of the other
solutions as well.

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Meditation-- it does create
physiological effects

00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.850 align:middle line:84%
that allows you to regenerate
better than sleeping.

00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can
actually affect the frequency

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:06.030 align:middle line:90%
of your cells themselves, OK?

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:09.810 align:middle line:84%
That harmonic that you
can create with the mind

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:11.190 align:middle line:90%
and with the spirit--

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:14.580 align:middle line:84%
bring the spirit in, because
it has a lot of information

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:17.100 align:middle line:90%
for us, if we would only listen.

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:18.900 align:middle line:84%
That is really
where we can start

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:21.440 align:middle line:84%
transcending whatever the
external world is throwing

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:22.240 align:middle line:90%
at us.

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.322 align:middle line:84%
And I believe we're
all capable of that.

00:53:24.322 --> 00:53:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: More than capable.

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is the number-one
thing I try to talk about.

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I do talk about the
dark things out there, like 5G,

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:35.070 align:middle line:90%
it has darkness in it.

00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:37.020 align:middle line:84%
It has some of the
things that we would

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:38.730 align:middle line:90%
like not to be engaged with.

00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:41.760 align:middle line:84%
But the importance of that is
that's also a catalyst for us

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.620 align:middle line:90%
to engage with the issue.

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And Ganesha is the
placer of obstacles

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:47.580 align:middle line:90%
and the remover of obstacles.

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:49.758 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So the
beauty of this is

00:53:49.758 --> 00:53:52.320 align:middle line:84%
when-- you were really talking
about the spiritual journey.

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.160 align:middle line:84%
We're all on a
spiritual journey.

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.760 align:middle line:84%
But it wouldn't be
there to engage with us

00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:58.860 align:middle line:90%
if everything was perfect.

00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:01.710 align:middle line:84%
I think we need some of
these obstacles for us

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:04.350 align:middle line:84%
to break ourselves out
of our comfort zones.

00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And here's my best and biggest
advice to the audience,

00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:12.930 align:middle line:84%
is there's not a single problem
in the outside world that

00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:15.160 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than our
inner solutions.

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.870 align:middle line:90%
I firmly believe that.

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:20.340 align:middle line:90%
And even if we do become--

00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:24.660 align:middle line:84%
not a martyr, but if we die for
our cause, we've still done it.

00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:26.580 align:middle line:84%
It's still encoded
into the field.

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Other people have
witnessed it, right?

00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I firmly believe
that we weren't given a memo

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.130 align:middle line:84%
from God or from
nature telling us

00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:39.230 align:middle line:84%
what we're owed in this life,
how we need to navigate it.

00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's really up for each of
us to discover and uncover it.

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we
need to, in a sense,

00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:49.530 align:middle line:84%
crack out of our shell, where
we need to be saved from things.

00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:51.270 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
be saved from this.

00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:52.103 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do not.

00:54:52.103 --> 00:54:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: We need to engage
with it properly and also

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:57.720 align:middle line:84%
demand, peacefully and
beautifully, almost

00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.400 align:middle line:84%
like the Hawaiians
out at Mauna Kea

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.220 align:middle line:84%
right now, where they are
standing in Kapu Aloha.

00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:04.590 align:middle line:84%
"Kapu" means "no,"
means "keep out."

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:06.840 align:middle line:90%
But "aloha" is "with love."

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:09.810 align:middle line:84%
It's different than
throwing Molotov cocktails

00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:11.580 align:middle line:90%
and getting in people's faces.

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:13.290 align:middle line:90%
It's all done with love.

00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:15.990 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's--

00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:19.770 align:middle line:84%
to be perfectly honest, I know
this with films, where like,

00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:22.512 align:middle line:84%
if I were to start screaming
while I'm doing my voiceover,

00:55:22.512 --> 00:55:23.970 align:middle line:84%
people are going
to get turned off.

00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:28.912 align:middle line:84%
But when you drop down into
a whisper, people lean in.

00:55:28.912 --> 00:55:30.870 align:middle line:84%
you're sucking them in,
like into a black hole.

00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what my
ballet teacher, Madame Beauvie,

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.160 align:middle line:90%
always said.

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Darling, if you want
people to listen, whisper.

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Whisper.

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:39.013 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's so true.

00:55:39.013 --> 00:55:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I love what you've
had to say about it.

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:44.040 align:middle line:84%
This is just a really silly,
popped into my mind aside,

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.350 align:middle line:84%
free association,
before we say goodbye.

00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:48.270 align:middle line:90%
But it's kind of interesting.

00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:51.032 align:middle line:84%
Ed Dames, who is
a remote viewer--

00:55:51.032 --> 00:55:52.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you probably
know about Ed Dames

00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:54.180 align:middle line:90%
and the other remote viewers.

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Ed Dames was telling me
in an interview one time

00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.370 align:middle line:84%
that when he and some of
the viewers were viewing,

00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:02.500 align:middle line:84%
they kept seeing this
elephantine character showing

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:03.300 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them at the time,
I said, was this Ganesha

00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:07.380 align:middle line:90%
that you were seeing?

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
speculated that's what

00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:12.480 align:middle line:90%
they were seeing in the field.

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, I thought, that's
random and weird.

00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:20.160 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, do we have
this remover, this bringer

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and removal of obstacles
metaphorically, or for real?

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Is it in the field around
us to help us and facilitate

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:27.950 align:middle line:90%
our own growth?

00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:30.283 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: You know what's
beautiful about the elephant?

00:56:30.283 --> 00:56:32.820 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it direct on,
and its trunk is falling down,

00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:34.440 align:middle line:90%
and its ears are flapping over--

00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
I love elephants.

00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: --you can superimpose
a toroidal field right

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:38.040 align:middle line:90%
on top of it.

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And for me, when
you're talking about the field,

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:44.970 align:middle line:90%
we have that toroidal field.

00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we are that.

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Actually,
every cell in our body--

00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're that.

00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: --has that.

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, we
do get to choose.

00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:52.950 align:middle line:10%
There's some of it--

00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:55.350 align:middle line:10%
I think the outside
world problems are there

00:56:55.350 --> 00:56:56.820 align:middle line:10%
for us to engage with.

00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:00.480 align:middle line:10%
But we do get to choose how
we show up each and every day.

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:03.990 align:middle line:10%
And that's why I like to end
all of these things with hope.

00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:05.730 align:middle line:10%
And this is a beautiful world.

00:57:05.730 --> 00:57:06.660 align:middle line:10%
It's a beautiful life.

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:08.640 align:middle line:10%
But you need to
show up that way.

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Agreed.

00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:10.780 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more.

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:11.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy to meet
you in the flesh.

00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's just been really
delightful talking with you.

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Thank you.

00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:16.980 align:middle line:90%
Same.

00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:18.600 align:middle line:84%
