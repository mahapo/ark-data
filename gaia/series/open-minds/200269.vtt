>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Our next guest

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.100 align:middle line:10%
may be familiar to
many of you as he's

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.700 align:middle line:10%
appeared on Gaia's "Deep Space"
and "Ancient Civilizations."

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Billy Carson has spent
much of his life digging

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.500 align:middle line:84%
into things hidden
from view, including

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.180 align:middle line:84%
the origins of
our human species,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.190 align:middle line:84%
which of course is one
of my favorite passions

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.565 align:middle line:84%
as well, which we're going to
get into in a little while.

00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:41.120 align:middle line:84%
But first, Billy, I want to
talk about you, because you

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.750 align:middle line:90%
were raised in Miami.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.670 align:middle line:84%
You're in an
African-American household,

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.940 align:middle line:90%
and you're a total nerd.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY CARSON: Yeah

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's talk
about your personal journey,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:84%
how that happened,
and how you were

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.005 align:middle line:84%
perceived by your friends,
your family, your teachers.

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:84%
They must have
totally loved you.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.210 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.742 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Well, it was a
little tougher at first.

00:00:58.742 --> 00:01:00.690 align:middle line:10%
Initially I was born
in New York in Queens

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.370 align:middle line:10%
and then, as a young child, age
of seven, moved down to Miami,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.610 align:middle line:10%
Florida to a place
called Opa-locka.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.465 align:middle line:10%
Not the most--

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Opa-locka.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Oompa Loompa.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, it's got its
own Wikipedia page and not

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.190 align:middle line:90%
for a good reason.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, what is that?

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, they built
a steel gate around the city

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.360 align:middle line:90%
to keep the crime on the inside.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:90%
So it's pretty bad.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, wow.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, I'd sleep
on the floor at night

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:84%
sometimes to prevent
you from getting shot.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because of bullets
flying through the windows?

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.260 align:middle line:90%
What the heck?

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.650 align:middle line:90%
Why did your parents move there?

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, you
know, it was trying

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.925 align:middle line:84%
to get away from New
York and come down

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.780 align:middle line:84%
here and get a fresh
start but still

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:90%
were very, extremely poor.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, so
when you're poor,

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.463 align:middle line:84%
you just go to
wherever you can go.

00:01:39.463 --> 00:01:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And that was the place
that they picked.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was cheap.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It was cheap.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.250 align:middle line:90%
It was easy.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.025 align:middle line:84%
And thought it was going to
be a fresh start, but it was--

00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doesn't
sound too fresh

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.810 align:middle line:84%
if you're having
to dodge bullets

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.770 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the night.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, not
too fresh at all.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So you saw a fair
amount, I assume,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.718 align:middle line:90%
in your youth of misfortune.

00:01:55.718 --> 00:01:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh, absolutely.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.927 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, there
were days when we would just

00:01:58.927 --> 00:02:00.270 align:middle line:90%
eat Karo syrup and toast.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:90%
That was our meal, you know?

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And neighbors would come
over sometimes and feed us

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.115 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:05.520 align:middle line:90%
But it was extremely rough.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.170 align:middle line:90%
It was not easy.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.759 align:middle line:90%
Two pairs of pants.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.720 align:middle line:90%
I would dye them.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:84%
I would bleach
them first and then

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.940 align:middle line:84%
dye them with the $0.79
dye from the grocery store.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, Rit's dye, yeah.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:15.330 align:middle line:90%
Rit's.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.500 align:middle line:84%
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I used to do the same.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Hey, you know.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So I would just change
the color of my pants

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:84%
so it looked like I
had different colors.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And I
would put cardboard

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.542 align:middle line:84%
inside the bottom of my
shoes, because, you know,

00:02:24.542 --> 00:02:27.542 align:middle line:84%
they were so old that the
holes were underneath.

00:02:27.542 --> 00:02:29.250 align:middle line:84%
I was playing sports
and everything else,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.460 align:middle line:84%
and they were still
two sizes too small.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:90%
But that's what I had to do.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then I
assume the toes burst out,

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.668 align:middle line:84%
and you got that
thing hanging through.

00:02:36.668 --> 00:02:39.168 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: (LAUGHING) Tore up
my knuckles and everything else

00:02:39.168 --> 00:02:40.100 align:middle line:90%
on my feet.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was wild.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.290 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty rough going.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How many
siblings did you have?

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.583 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Three.

00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:45.956 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:45.956 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Three?

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so where did
you fall in the birth order?

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I was the first.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm the oldest.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.782 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And then
much, much later I

00:02:52.782 --> 00:02:54.840 align:middle line:84%
had a fourth, a brother
that was born much later.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.880 align:middle line:84%
But it was just the
three of us initially.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So with
literally bullets

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.050 align:middle line:84%
whizzing by and not
enough food in your belly

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and just seeing a lot of
the heavier side of life

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.140 align:middle line:84%
all around you, I mean,
you couldn't escape it.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:90%
But what happened?

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.980 align:middle line:84%
How did you end up having a
fascination with the sciences

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:84%
and becoming a nerd
amidst all of that?

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Because that's not
your common trajectory.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: No, it's not.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.005 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I watched everybody
going different trajectories.

00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:23.752 align:middle line:84%
But when I was very young,
I was living in this ghetto

00:03:23.752 --> 00:03:25.710 align:middle line:84%
and seeing people going
to the ice cream truck.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, we're
all poor, but they've

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.890 align:middle line:84%
got money to go to the ice
cream truck and I don't like.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, how much
more poor are we?

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So I came up with the
idea that I would just

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.670 align:middle line:84%
sell all the little
toys that I did have.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.760 align:middle line:84%
I said, from this point forward,
I don't need toys anymore.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.590 align:middle line:84%
I would go door to door, and
I would sell toys for $0.10,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:90%
$0.05, a nickel, a penny.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Just to have
money in my pocket

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.168 align:middle line:84%
so I can go to the ice cream
truck and feel kind of normal.

00:03:43.168 --> 00:03:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So I did
that, and that's

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.350 align:middle line:84%
when something
clicked inside of me.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that the key
to making money or the key

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.760 align:middle line:84%
to helping myself and
becoming my own savior,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.570 align:middle line:84%
well, if I can find
a need and fill it.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I learned
myself at an early age like,

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.763 align:middle line:84%
wow, this is where
I need to be doing.

00:03:58.763 --> 00:04:01.320 align:middle line:84%
I need to be finding ways
to help myself and not

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:90%
sit around waiting for help.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were
obviously extra resourceful.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Mm-hmm.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you also got a
beat on something very early

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.090 align:middle line:90%
on--

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.560 align:middle line:90%
A, you have to help yourself.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because no one's
going to do it for you.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: That's right.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But along the way,
did you have certain people that

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:84%
came in like little mentors or
little angels that would kind

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.529 align:middle line:84%
of show up here
and there or were

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.071 align:middle line:84%
you pretty much left to have to
find a lot of it on your own?

00:04:22.071 --> 00:04:24.612 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Unfortunately, I had
to find a lot of it on my own,

00:04:24.612 --> 00:04:25.890 align:middle line:90%
but maybe fortunately as well.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And my dad
was pretty strict.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, he had me
doing book reports

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:84%
and reading a lot
from an early age.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I was already
reading books-books,

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.190 align:middle line:84%
not like kids books, but
real books at the age of one.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One?

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, age of one, I
was already reading real books,

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.400 align:middle line:90%
novels.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.692 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How is that possible?

00:04:39.692 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who fostered
this in you?

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.330 align:middle line:90%
That's impressive.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.610 align:middle line:84%
That's protege
material obviously.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: One thing I got to
give him credit for, you know,

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.140 align:middle line:84%
out of a lot of other
things was he really

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.350 align:middle line:84%
impressed upon us to do
these book reports every week

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:90%
and read.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.840 align:middle line:84%
He would take me out in
the middle of the night

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.640 align:middle line:84%
to these bars to recite the
Bible verses to his buddies

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:90%
at the bars.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How old were you?

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I was
one, two years old.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
could barely speak.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, I
was speaking very--

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I was already
walking at 10 months.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, It's almost like if
we do have past lives

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and you had died,
you were barely cold,

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and you came in with all
your knowledge from before.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I came
in pretty decent.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.080 align:middle line:84%
I had some good brain matter
when I came back this time.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.650 align:middle line:90%
That's really impressive.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.860 align:middle line:84%
So when you say book
reports, this was something

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.760 align:middle line:90%
that he had you do as a family.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.700 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't necessarily
correlating

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.610 align:middle line:90%
with your schoolwork.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was way
before all of that.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Way before
all the school work.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, by the time I actually
got to school in Miami,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.075 align:middle line:84%
they just said, you
can't go to kindergarten.

00:05:34.075 --> 00:05:35.575 align:middle line:84%
We've got to put
you in first grade.

00:05:35.575 --> 00:05:37.200 align:middle line:84%
You can go to the
second if you'd like.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And I said yes,
but my parents said

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.660 align:middle line:90%
no, just put him in the first.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
of emotional development

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.350 align:middle line:90%
and friendships and everything.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, was there anything that
stands out when you were really

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.620 align:middle line:84%
little-- now, this is before
you go to school, preschool--

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.430 align:middle line:84%
where some of the subjects
that your dad had you

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.225 align:middle line:84%
read, for example, actually
struck a chord with you?

00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well,
I started reading

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.130 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different
books about biology.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.930 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Biology at
two and three and four?

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.630 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a taskmaster.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.775 align:middle line:84%
You could have at
least read some novels.

00:06:06.775 --> 00:06:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I learned about
osmosis and things like that.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.650 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I did read a novel.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.160 align:middle line:90%
And that novel was called--

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.493 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, it was one of the
greatest books I ever read.

00:06:13.493 --> 00:06:15.520 align:middle line:90%
It was "The Sea-Wolf."

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: "The Sea-Wolf"
was the first novel I read.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Wow, you took me all
the way back just now.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.183 align:middle line:90%
So how old were you--

00:06:22.183 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Jack London.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Jack London.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.230 align:middle line:84%
How old were you
when you read that?

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I think I was
about three years old

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.410 align:middle line:90%
when I read that novel.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what
struck you about it?

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is now
the art of story,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.100 align:middle line:84%
which involves the whole
being, which is why

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.240 align:middle line:90%
I love your stories so much.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing about
that was the fact

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
that this man had
to go on the ocean.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And he was kind of almost
in a way kind of alone,

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:90%
kind of like how I was.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And he had to face
this tide and face

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:84%
this treacherous situation, you
know, to become the sea wolf.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And it just really
stuck with me.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And it gave me the idea
and concept of perseverance

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:90%
at a very early age.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were your siblings
as tenacious as you were?

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, my sister
and my brother, we all

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:90%
had our unique talents.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.450 align:middle line:84%
My sister was a
very great athlete.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.190 align:middle line:90%
She qualified for the Olympics.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In what sport?

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: In track.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.726 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: That was in 1980--

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:17.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry-- 1996.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And then my brother, he
was a brilliant mechanic.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.537 align:middle line:84%
I saw him literally
take a junker

00:07:21.537 --> 00:07:23.370 align:middle line:84%
that my dad brought
home, because my dad was

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.412 align:middle line:90%
like a backyard mechanic.

00:07:24.412 --> 00:07:27.000 align:middle line:84%
He took a car apart with
no training, no nothing,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.642 align:middle line:84%
and put it all back together
again and turned it on.

00:07:29.642 --> 00:07:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So your dad really
flipped a lot of good switches

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.110 align:middle line:84%
in you even if it was
a challenging life.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:84%
What happened to him to make
him so demanding of you?

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, his mother
passed away when he was 16,

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:84%
His dad left to get a
pack of cigarettes one day

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.058 align:middle line:90%
and never came home.

00:07:44.058 --> 00:07:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So he was on his own.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: He was on
his own, you know.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.620 align:middle line:90%
So it was rough for him.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.182 align:middle line:90%
He had a rough way to go.

00:07:49.182 --> 00:07:50.640 align:middle line:10%
And he had some
issues as well, you

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.973 align:middle line:10%
know, psychologically, and
kind of still does, you know.

00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:54.570 align:middle line:84%
But I guess in the
best way he could,

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.153 align:middle line:84%
he tried to instill
some things in us,

00:07:56.153 --> 00:07:57.630 align:middle line:90%
and it actually did work.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love it,
because everywhere you look,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.290 align:middle line:84%
there's the possibility for
instilling something more

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.090 align:middle line:90%
and hope.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Mm-hmm.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, and
even in what seemingly

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.640 align:middle line:84%
look like hopeless
environments-- and your story

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.610 align:middle line:84%
is a really beautiful
one of perseverance,

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.030 align:middle line:84%
of bringing knowledge forward,
and putting pieces together.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.530 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go
into the point where

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:84%
you started becoming, even
in school, kind of the nerd.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.565 align:middle line:84%
And how did that position
you in your neighborhood?

00:08:23.565 --> 00:08:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Kind of tough.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Used to have to get in
fights every single day

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.360 align:middle line:90%
at Rainbow Park Elementary.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.070 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.653 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, I
didn't talk the talk

00:08:31.653 --> 00:08:33.210 align:middle line:90%
of the people in Florida.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.789 align:middle line:84%
They had this very southern
accent and a lot of slang

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:37.010 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't know yet.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.718 align:middle line:84%
And being that I just
came from New York,

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:41.575 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking more like a New
Yorker versus some of the words

00:08:41.575 --> 00:08:42.450 align:middle line:90%
that they were using.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.870 align:middle line:84%
I literally didn't know
what they were saying,

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and they thought I was trying
to be boujee or uptight

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.800 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, I was
always seen as an enemy

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.510 align:middle line:90%
and somebody to fight.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.682 align:middle line:84%
So me my brother would get
in fights, and he would--

00:08:52.682 --> 00:08:55.140 align:middle line:84%
they would-- you know, he was
very small even though he was

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.120 align:middle line:90%
only one year younger than me.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And so they would
challenge him first.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And he would tell them
that I would beat them up.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.350 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, boy.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:01.440 align:middle line:90%
The game's on.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh my goodness.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you had a big
target on your forehead.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: All the time.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yikes.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how it
worked for you scholastically

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.010 align:middle line:84%
where you started
becoming intrigued

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.320 align:middle line:84%
with science, ultimately
where you became

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.490 align:middle line:84%
intrigued with
ancient civilizations.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all the way now,
you've created a space agency

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.920 align:middle line:84%
and are doing very
avant-garde, futuristic work.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So where did that part
of the journey begin?

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, when
I got to the school,

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest
parts of my day

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.610 align:middle line:84%
was when they would let us
go once a week to the library

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:30.510 align:middle line:90%
at the school.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.468 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I discovered
the encyclopedias.

00:09:32.468 --> 00:09:34.135 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't been looking
at any technology.

00:09:34.135 --> 00:09:36.030 align:middle line:84%
I was just looking at
a lot of the biology

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.350 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:84%
But then one day
in my backyard--

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.800 align:middle line:84%
we lived close to the
Opa-locka Airport.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.300 align:middle line:84%
So I was watching
airplanes go over.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Just a little private
airport down there.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And one day, when
this thing came over,

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.010 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't an actual airplane.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't know about aliens
or UFOs because I was a kid.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And with four channels on
the TV, black and white TV,

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.200 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't anything
to make me think

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.790 align:middle line:84%
about aliens I
just knew it didn't

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.500 align:middle line:84%
have a fuselage, a
cockpit, and wings.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.022 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And I said, what
in the world was that?

00:10:01.022 --> 00:10:02.814 align:middle line:84%
But then it cleared
the horizon in seconds,

00:10:02.814 --> 00:10:05.022 align:middle line:84%
which is almost impossible
for a regular plane to do.

00:10:05.022 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:90%
I knew that as a kid.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.327 align:middle line:84%
It came back and
hovered above me,

00:10:07.327 --> 00:10:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and then it took off the
way that it came back inn.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:10.887 align:middle line:84%
And I went straight
to the school,

00:10:10.887 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:84%
and I got all the Encyclopedia
Britannicas on aerospace.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
researching in 1977, Rainbow

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Park Elementary, every single
encyclopedia I can dig down

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and started going over
everything from the STS

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.350 align:middle line:84%
to the different submarines
to the ballistic missiles.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I learned
it, studied it.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.370 align:middle line:84%
From that day, I
was into it heavy.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
believe in past lives?

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:30.883 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes, I do.

00:10:30.883 --> 00:10:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you probably
brought some proclivities

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.520 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.390 align:middle line:90%
You must have had--

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously you had
a very scientific brain,

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:41.660 align:middle line:84%
and your ability to go into such
deep inquiry at a young age.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, OK, so let's say
you already had a head start.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.865 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you're
still a young man now, OK?

00:10:46.865 --> 00:10:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So where did that
take you from there,

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and how did that go
through your education?

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
teachers-- you must

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.507 align:middle line:84%
have been teacher's pet
in more than one case.

00:10:56.507 --> 00:10:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Well, it was too easy.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'll be honest with you.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.487 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I got bored a lot.

00:11:00.487 --> 00:11:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And I would
find myself sometimes even

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.270 align:middle line:84%
helping the teacher
teach the class.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Getting straight A's
was just commonplace.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In your sleep.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, I came
home one day with--

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.020 align:middle line:84%
I got an A minus
on one of my tests.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And because I had never
had an A minus before,

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.987 align:middle line:90%
I came home crying.

00:11:15.987 --> 00:11:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And my mom goes, what's
wrong, what's wrong?

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.945 align:middle line:90%
And I go, I got an A minus.

00:11:18.945 --> 00:11:20.445 align:middle line:90%
And she started laughing at me.

00:11:20.445 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was going to get
in trouble for this A minus.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.440 align:middle line:84%
That's how, you know,
regimented I was with grades.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.360 align:middle line:84%
I had no clue that getting
less than an A was acceptable.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So yes, I
was really like a nerd.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle line:90%
I did very well.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.510 align:middle line:84%
I excelled in
school very easily.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.032 align:middle line:10%
Even if I miss days working--
because my mom and dad

00:11:38.032 --> 00:11:39.740 align:middle line:10%
had a-- they worked
at the "Miami Herald"

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.510 align:middle line:10%
delivering newspapers.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes my
mom would be sick,

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and I would have
to go with my dad

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.517 align:middle line:84%
and deliver newspapers from
3 o'clock in the morning

00:11:47.517 --> 00:11:49.595 align:middle line:84%
till 8:00 AM and then
go straight to school.

00:11:49.595 --> 00:11:51.757 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes it would
be even extended periods

00:11:51.757 --> 00:11:53.840 align:middle line:84%
during the holidays, and
I'd miss a lot of school.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.423 align:middle line:84%
But I would just go
and take the tests

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:90%
and pass them with no problem.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.263 align:middle line:84%
And I scored so high
on the ASVAB test

00:11:59.263 --> 00:12:01.180 align:middle line:84%
that the military came
after me for five years

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.060 align:middle line:90%
after graduation.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I want
to hear about that part

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.970 align:middle line:84%
because people like
you are always--

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.850 align:middle line:84%
they become people of
interest to the military

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:90%
and the intelligence industries.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.450 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, back then there
wasn't like an SAT or FCAT.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.682 align:middle line:90%
That's something more new.

00:12:15.682 --> 00:12:17.765 align:middle line:84%
But back then, they had
something called the ASVAB

00:12:17.765 --> 00:12:20.960 align:middle line:84%
test, and it would test you
for all different aspects

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:84%
of psychology,
mathematics, and physics--

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Looking for kind
of extraordinary personality

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:90%
traits.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:27.395 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Correct.

00:12:27.395 --> 00:12:28.670 align:middle line:90%
And they had an eye test too.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.170 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't have eye dominance.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:31.010 align:middle line:90%
So that was one of the things.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted me to be a
pilot, both the Navy and the Air

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.850 align:middle line:90%
Force.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And I remember even one
day just visiting my mom,

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.420 align:middle line:84%
going to her house to
see how she was doing.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And the phone rings, and she
goes, oh, it's the Air Force.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:90%
They're calling for you.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, how in the world
do they know I'm even here?

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.400 align:middle line:90%
That was wild.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.060 align:middle line:90%
And this is in the 1990s.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.290 align:middle line:90%
So that was like--

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.880 align:middle line:90%
that just blew me away.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I mean, I'm
looking at this and thinking,

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.980 align:middle line:84%
first of all, with the
kind of scores you had

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of brain
you had, intellect, it

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.930 align:middle line:84%
seems like it's under
utilization trying

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.350 align:middle line:90%
to get you on as a pilot.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Looking
back on it, what do

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:11.848 align:middle line:90%
you think was going on there?

00:13:11.848 --> 00:13:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, now that I've
researched a lot of these areas

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:14.870 align:middle line:90%
of interest--

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:15.767 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:15.767 --> 00:13:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You know,
they get you in one way,

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:84%
and then they maneuver you
to different departments

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.330 align:middle line:90%
after a while.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.110 align:middle line:90%
So they get you in.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.277 align:middle line:84%
They really test you out,
see what you're all about,

00:13:23.277 --> 00:13:24.277 align:middle line:90%
see if they can really--

00:13:24.277 --> 00:13:26.027 align:middle line:84%
I hate to use the word,
but manipulate you

00:13:26.027 --> 00:13:27.763 align:middle line:84%
into certain areas
or ways of thinking

00:13:27.763 --> 00:13:29.180 align:middle line:84%
or are you on board
with them, are

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.560 align:middle line:84%
you going to think the
way they think and do

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.602 align:middle line:90%
what they tell you to do.

00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you can meet
those criteria,

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.810 align:middle line:84%
then they'll maneuver you
into other departments,

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:38.620 align:middle line:84%
whether it be DARPA or
top-secret departments

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.710 align:middle line:84%
or who knows, secret space
programs or whatever.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:41.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.900 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, I just
kept running from them.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.620 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
be involved in it.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.203 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What made
you run from them?

00:13:47.203 --> 00:13:49.225 align:middle line:84%
Did you have an innate
sense of knowing?

00:13:49.225 --> 00:13:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well,
even at that age,

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.785 align:middle line:84%
I realized that, in
my personal opinion,

00:13:53.785 --> 00:13:55.160 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
lot of suffering

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:90%
going on in the world.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And I believed that a
lot of the wars that

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.170 align:middle line:84%
were going on even back then
were based off of capitalism.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yep.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And people in $2,000
suits sending out young people

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:05.702 align:middle line:84%
like me to go die
on the front lines,

00:14:05.702 --> 00:14:07.160 align:middle line:84%
and they were never
getting killed,

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.743 align:middle line:84%
and their kids weren't
getting killed.

00:14:08.743 --> 00:14:11.060 align:middle line:84%
So why would I kill myself
for them to make a profit?

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:84%
You were very, very
wise at a young age.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you avoided being
entrapped or ensnared

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.610 align:middle line:84%
into a lifelong career with
the military or intelligence

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.470 align:middle line:84%
communities, which you
would have obviously

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:22.920 align:middle line:90%
been targeted for eventually.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then what
did you end up doing?

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So I ended up going
into sales and marketing.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.130 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you know--

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.580 align:middle line:84%
I remember from the early
age, sales and marketing was

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.590 align:middle line:84%
the way, because
even when I was 13,

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.810 align:middle line:84%
I saved up all the money
from my newspaper route,

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.580 align:middle line:90%
and I bought electronics.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.400 align:middle line:84%
I knew everything was going
to go from 8-track players

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.320 align:middle line:90%
to digital radios.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.795 align:middle line:84%
So I invested with a company
called Galaxy Electronics out

00:14:44.795 --> 00:14:47.405 align:middle line:84%
of New York, and I started
buying these digital radios.

00:14:47.405 --> 00:14:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How old were you?

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: 13.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Saw the trends coming.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:51.950 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.945 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And it
worked out very well.

00:14:54.945 --> 00:14:56.570 align:middle line:84%
I became one of the
largest electronics

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.100 align:middle line:90%
dealers in the Tri-County area.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As a kid?

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: As a kid, yeah.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:90%
And then I literally--

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I had people coming from other
counties to buy electronics

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.718 align:middle line:84%
from me, everything from EQ
boosters to subwoofers and amps

00:15:08.718 --> 00:15:10.760 align:middle line:84%
and these digital car
radios with cassette decks,

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.780 align:middle line:84%
the high-powered
powered cassette--

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the whole thing.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.218 align:middle line:90%
I still have all my invoices.

00:15:14.218 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: And I did very well.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And then I ended up moving
out at the age of 16.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So I ran my business, moved
out, got myself a car,

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and got my own
apartment and everything

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.440 align:middle line:90%
and still graduated from school.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.825 align:middle line:90%
So what happens after that?

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:28.700 align:middle line:84%
We're just moving right
on through your life.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I know.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.110 align:middle line:84%
After that, you
know, I decided--

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.080 align:middle line:84%
well, the school
guidance counselor

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.550 align:middle line:84%
never interacted with any
of us at the high school

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.350 align:middle line:90%
that I was at.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Only just the very elite of
the elite football players,

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.870 align:middle line:84%
but nobody else
got any attention.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.110 align:middle line:84%
They were too busy,
unfortunately,

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.360 align:middle line:84%
selling drugs and having sex
with the girls at school.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And that's really
what they were doing.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
got all the attention.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And they
eventually got

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.530 align:middle line:90%
busted for what they were doing.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Some of them, I think,
are still locked up right now.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.910 align:middle line:84%
The athletic director was
also one of the biggest drug

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:90%
dealers in the county.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.970 align:middle line:90%
Sadly not an uncommon story.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't have any
guidance that way as to what

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:90%
I could do collegiately.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to just go out and
just become my own marketing

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.127 align:middle line:90%
company and do my own thing.

00:16:09.127 --> 00:16:10.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's literally what I did.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So I started working and
developing my marketing skills,

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and I started several little
different marketing companies.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.730 align:middle line:84%
By the time I got
to 1998, I realized

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.427 align:middle line:84%
that the future was moving
into this internet market,

00:16:22.427 --> 00:16:25.010 align:middle line:84%
even though there was only like
15 or 20 websites at the time.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.510 align:middle line:90%
I saw the vision.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:90%
IBM had a website.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Only a few Fortune 500
companies had them.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: But I saw it, and I
said, wow, this is incredible.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And with synchronicity,
a neighbor

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.550 align:middle line:84%
that lived in my community
contacted me and said--

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.550 align:middle line:90%
he saw me outside a lot.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:84%
So he said, hey, I know you
have this little health care

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:40.933 align:middle line:90%
marketing company.

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Would you be
interested in letting

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.085 align:middle line:90%
me make a website for that?

00:16:44.085 --> 00:16:44.960 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, sure.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.160 align:middle line:90%
I was just looking at websites.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.180 align:middle line:90%
That's the wave of the future.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.472 align:middle line:90%
He goes, I'm in college for it.

00:16:48.472 --> 00:16:50.030 align:middle line:90%
I have to do it as an intern.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.890 align:middle line:90%
So he built me a little website.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And it literally went viral
the weekend that it launched.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:59.610 align:middle line:84%
We sent out only 50,000 emails,
and I got 4,000 new customers

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:00.410 align:middle line:90%
in one weekend.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, that's
like a dream for anyone

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.050 align:middle line:90%
in today's world.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh my god.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.359 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody wanted
to open email back then.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:06.829 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: There was only
a few hundred thousand

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:07.480 align:middle line:90%
email addresses.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.089 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And so
it was phenomenal.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to start my own
internet marketing company

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.228 align:middle line:84%
and do e-commerce and
website development.

00:17:14.228 --> 00:17:15.770 align:middle line:84%
So I literally went
to the bookstore.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.437 align:middle line:84%
I would read the books
at the bookstore,

00:17:17.437 --> 00:17:18.859 align:middle line:90%
take notes, and come home.

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:21.670 align:middle line:84%
I went to Rent-A-Center,
and I got a $19.95 a week

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:22.496 align:middle line:90%
Packard Bell.

00:17:22.496 --> 00:17:24.079 align:middle line:84%
I used to call it
my Packard from hell

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.579 align:middle line:84%
because it would
crash all the time.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:84%
2-gigabyte hard
drive on AOL dial-up.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.553 align:middle line:84%
And I started making
websites myself.

00:17:30.553 --> 00:17:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I came
up with a template

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:32.985 align:middle line:90%
for mortgage companies.

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And I realized with
mortgage companies,

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.200 align:middle line:84%
with a service-based
industry, I just

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.535 align:middle line:84%
got to change the colors
and some of the text around.

00:17:38.535 --> 00:17:39.410 align:middle line:90%
And boom, boom, boom.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.515 align:middle line:84%
So I would call out of
the Yellow Pages Monday,

00:17:41.515 --> 00:17:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday,

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:44.480 align:middle line:84%
set my appointments
up for Friday.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Saturday and Sunday
do the websites.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.077 align:middle line:84%
And I was earning six
figures doing that.

00:17:49.077 --> 00:17:49.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:50.993 align:middle line:90%
And this was 20 years ago.

00:17:50.993 --> 00:17:52.403 align:middle line:90%
Six figures was a lot of money.

00:17:52.403 --> 00:17:53.570 align:middle line:90%
So you taught yourself code.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.053 align:middle line:90%
You taught yourself everything?

00:17:55.053 --> 00:17:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I write
five coding languages.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.145 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Billy,
you're something else.

00:17:59.145 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:02.033 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where you
came from and what you are,

00:18:02.033 --> 00:18:03.778 align:middle line:90%
but you are something else.

00:18:03.778 --> 00:18:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I've just
been blessed, you know,

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.210 align:middle line:84%
to have a good retention
and be able to see

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:09.740 align:middle line:90%
what the future is going to be.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Eventually that company became
a multimillion-dollar dot com.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And that was the name of the
company, Dotcom Marketing

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.050 align:middle line:90%
Group.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.717 align:middle line:84%
And the press releases
are still online.

00:18:16.717 --> 00:18:19.252 align:middle line:84%
I actually ended up getting
approached by a company called

00:18:19.252 --> 00:18:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Glow Bench Systems that was on
the pink sheets in the stock

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:22.570 align:middle line:90%
market.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.880 align:middle line:84%
They needed a cash rich
company to join with them

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.460 align:middle line:84%
or to emerge so that they
can go bigger with the stock

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and also then a merger
and then sell it.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:90%
And they ended up selling to--

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.190 align:middle line:90%
they bought me out.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And then we ended up selling
it to the Amber Alert system.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So my initial
company, my dotcom,

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.240 align:middle line:84%
funded initially the
Amber Alert company.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Amber Alert company.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:44.720 align:middle line:90%
God, this is crazy.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Obviously ice cream trucks were
no longer a challenge for you.

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But how did this go down with
your family and the people

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:90%
in your past?

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes you
can be either, you know,

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.798 align:middle line:84%
viewed as a hero or
you can be taken down

00:18:56.798 --> 00:18:59.090 align:middle line:84%
because you're different and
you've surpassed everybody

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:00.110 align:middle line:90%
else's--

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.680 align:middle line:84%
It gets kind of tough, I
mean, because everybody

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.010 align:middle line:90%
wants something from you.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.927 align:middle line:84%
And you can't give
everything you have.

00:19:05.927 --> 00:19:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Initially I thought I could, and
I was giving, giving, giving.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I'm
giving away too much now.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I've still got
to survive and live myself.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's got to be a point
where you've got to say no.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
start saying no, you

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.500 align:middle line:84%
run into a lot of animosity,
hate, and issues and problems

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.370 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.495 align:middle line:84%
People are, why can't you
do, why can't-- you know.

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:24.630 align:middle line:84%
You got to realize, if
I do this for everybody,

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:25.550 align:middle line:90%
I have nothing left for myself.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.592 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is a problem
of wealth, especially

00:19:27.592 --> 00:19:28.770 align:middle line:90%
newly created wealth.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.270 align:middle line:84%
How did it go down
with your family?

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, you know,
I've been alienated from some.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:35.450 align:middle line:90%
I stepped back myself.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:36.320 align:middle line:90%
I alienated myself.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.487 align:middle line:90%
I stepped back a little bit.

00:19:37.487 --> 00:19:39.778 align:middle line:84%
And I will only go back for
different times of the year

00:19:39.778 --> 00:19:40.910 align:middle line:90%
and so forth and so on.

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:44.390 align:middle line:84%
I help people when I possibly
can, especially the closer--

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.760 align:middle line:84%
you know, family, like
your initial family.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.360 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't that easy.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Just being honest with you.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Everybody expects me to
always-- when something happens

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.990 align:middle line:84%
in family, like there's an
issue that needs money--

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
going to pay for it.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I'm going to pay.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's automatically
assumed that will be the case.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:02.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now you're
still quite young.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Mm-hmm.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, when
this buyout happened,

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:90%
how old are you by this time?

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: In that time,
I think I was in my 20s.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were in your 20s.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.800 align:middle line:90%
So progress on.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.223 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Well, I've had kids.

00:20:14.223 --> 00:20:16.640 align:middle line:84%
My high school sweetheart, we
actually had a kid together.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.650 align:middle line:90%
We ended up getting married.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.650 align:middle line:84%
We ended up going our separate
ways right at the time

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:23.930 align:middle line:84%
that all this was happening,
not because of any issues

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:24.730 align:middle line:90%
or problems.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:84%
It just was-- it was
the right thing to do.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So we got together
because she got pregnant.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.440 align:middle line:84%
But I ended up
meeting somebody else

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and getting married again and
raising a total of five kids.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And we lived
a very, very good life.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I've done things with
them that I never

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.330 align:middle line:90%
could have done as my own kid--

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.105 align:middle line:90%
as a kid myself I would say.

00:20:43.105 --> 00:20:44.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember
waking them up

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.040 align:middle line:84%
in middle of a Saturday
morning and saying,

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.450 align:middle line:90%
hey, just get up, get dressed.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:49.220 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get on the plane.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Don't bring any clothes.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:84%
We'll buy clothes
when we get there.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my gosh.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:53.120 align:middle line:90%
Every little kid's dream.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh yeah.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.308 align:middle line:84%
You know, we'll just
fly to Busch Gardens

00:20:55.308 --> 00:20:57.740 align:middle line:84%
or fly to the
Bahamas or whatever.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.305 align:middle line:84%
And so they had a
really good life.

00:20:59.305 --> 00:21:00.680 align:middle line:84%
I was heavily
involved with them.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.987 align:middle line:84%
I took seven years
off, and I just

00:21:02.987 --> 00:21:04.820 align:middle line:84%
invested all my time
and energy to coaching,

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:84%
which is why I became
known as Coach Billy.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh!

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.210 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: All the volunteers,
all their schools,

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.740 align:middle line:84%
all the sporting programs,
AAU, eventually from AAU even

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.210 align:middle line:90%
to the US Junior Olympics--

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Love it.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.135 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: --Team USA coach.

00:21:17.135 --> 00:21:19.255 align:middle line:84%
I'm still a registered
Team USA coach right now.

00:21:19.255 --> 00:21:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
really gave them

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:22.280 align:middle line:84%
everything that
every child would

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.400 align:middle line:84%
love to have by way
of encouragement,

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.315 align:middle line:90%
opportunity, even resources.

00:21:27.315 --> 00:21:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Everything.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They had it all.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: They had it all.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.730 align:middle line:84%
They knew that they
couldn't screw up

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.470 align:middle line:84%
because I was going to be right
there at their school anyway

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:34.270 align:middle line:90%
volunteering.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.990 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I was
everywhere they went.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Even at the YMCA, I helped
fund the YMCA in West Broward

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:41.180 align:middle line:84%
so they would have a
facility to play at.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.597 align:middle line:84%
So when you walk
in there, my name

00:21:42.597 --> 00:21:45.530 align:middle line:84%
is on the giant granite
wall as a founding member,

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.420 align:middle line:90%
the rock climbing wall room.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.070 align:middle line:90%
I really gave back a lot.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I put a lot
of energy into helping

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:53.420 align:middle line:84%
underprivileged children
get the opportunity

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.160 align:middle line:84%
to go to college
and play sports.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.243 align:middle line:84%
And through that effort,
it was almost $12 million

00:21:57.243 --> 00:21:59.450 align:middle line:84%
in funding for
college scholarships

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:00.710 align:middle line:90%
for girls' basketball.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:01.668 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good for you.

00:22:01.668 --> 00:22:02.502 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Thank you.

00:22:02.502 --> 00:22:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we start
moving toward where

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:05.370 align:middle line:90%
you are at this moment.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Mm-hmm.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So then through all of that,
I was still doing my research.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:11.950 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you stay intrigued
with the notion of flying

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.220 align:middle line:84%
devices that didn't appear to
be anything of Earth origin?

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh yeah.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that remained
a peak interest of yours.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.315 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:22:22.315 --> 00:22:23.220 align:middle line:90%
Nonstop.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.095 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had telescopes
and everything else.

00:22:25.095 --> 00:22:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was always looking for
these things to come back.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't see
any until recently.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.100 align:middle line:84%
But during that
process, unfortunately

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:35.160 align:middle line:84%
the wife that I had at
the time, it scared her.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.160 align:middle line:90%
And I can understand it.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.700 align:middle line:84%
The stuff that I
was really into--

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's outside the box.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.952 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's outside the box.

00:22:39.952 --> 00:22:41.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's not the average thing.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you have people
from agencies or anything kind

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.090 align:middle line:84%
of tracking you or watching
you during this time

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:47.810 align:middle line:90%
or had you gone off the radar?

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I think I
was off the radar.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: If they were,
I didn't know about it.

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Just checking in there.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:53.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: But what
happened was when

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.573 align:middle line:84%
I did build this website called
Survive Pole Shifts, because I

00:22:56.573 --> 00:22:58.490 align:middle line:84%
really-- after doing
a lot of research,

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.032 align:middle line:84%
I came to the conclusion that
we had pole shifts in the past.

00:23:01.032 --> 00:23:02.730 align:middle line:84%
This is why Antarctica
is where it's at

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and why animals
still have undigested

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.540 align:middle line:90%
food in their bellies.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And I came to the
conclusion that we

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.498 align:middle line:84%
were going to have another one
probably within the next 200

00:23:09.498 --> 00:23:10.400 align:middle line:90%
years or so.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.870 align:middle line:84%
So I started researching
that very heavily,

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:90%
and I made a website about it.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And that kept
getting hacked down.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I started a mobile
app development company

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:18.260 align:middle line:90%
around that time.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And the app was getting taken
down from Apple and also from,

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:22.610 align:middle line:90%
at that time, Android.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.200 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't Google Play yet.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't give me any
answers why that was happening.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.630 align:middle line:84%
So I backed off on it
for a little while,

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.810 align:middle line:84%
and I just kept doing my own
private research for a few more

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:34.950 align:middle line:84%
years, you know, and just
keeping it under wraps.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.180 align:middle line:84%
But it definitely
affected my relationship.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Between that and all the
coaching, it was just like,

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:42.742 align:middle line:90%
she didn't have enough QT.

00:23:42.742 --> 00:23:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:43.960 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So we ended up
going our separate ways,

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.855 align:middle line:84%
but after the kids were already
in college and everything else.

00:23:47.855 --> 00:23:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing
about the pole shift,

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.270 align:middle line:84%
were you looking at it from the
point of view of magnetic field

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.470 align:middle line:90%
shifts?

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Not the magnetic
field so to speak,

00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:59.760 align:middle line:90%
even though that does happen.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.060 align:middle line:84%
It's happening right
now as we speak.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.018 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, it is.

00:24:02.018 --> 00:24:05.480 align:middle line:84%
So where were you
basically tapping into it?

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I was realizing that
the crust of the earth, it

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:12.140 align:middle line:84%
shifts, and it locks
together at these points.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And then at certain
times, depending

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.010 align:middle line:84%
on the gravitational forces,
especially if there's

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.260 align:middle line:84%
another gravitational
body in our solar system

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.900 align:middle line:84%
or close by our sun, which
I thought was probably

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.650 align:middle line:84%
called this nemesis object, in
the Enuma Elish, it's called.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:26.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a brown dwarf star.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered
that, in my opinion,

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.917 align:middle line:84%
it was really out
there based on some

00:24:29.917 --> 00:24:32.000 align:middle line:84%
of the watching of the
procession of the equinoxes

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.390 align:middle line:84%
and realizing our sun was
speeding up in procession.

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:36.710 align:middle line:90%
So why would our sun speed up?

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:39.090 align:middle line:84%
That raised a big
question in my mind.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:41.290 align:middle line:84%
So I started researching
if our sun is speeding up,

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:42.723 align:middle line:84%
it's doing it for
breakaway speed.

00:24:42.723 --> 00:24:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
came to the conclusion

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.550 align:middle line:84%
early on that we must be
orbiting another star,

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.000 align:middle line:90%
but how come we can't see it?

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.960 align:middle line:84%
So I started researching
that and found out

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.580 align:middle line:84%
that there are red
dwarfs and brown dwarfs.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Which now my
theories that I wrote

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.900 align:middle line:84%
about all these years have
just now been verified

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.760 align:middle line:90%
because the science community--

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The sun
in a binary star--

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: We're in a
binary star system.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Companionship
with another star.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's
been verified now.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, OK, so
Walter Cruttenden, you know,

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.398 align:middle line:90%
had his conferences for years.

00:25:08.398 --> 00:25:09.440 align:middle line:90%
And that was his passion.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh, wow.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was an amateur--

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:12.620 align:middle line:90%
but a good one--

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:13.940 align:middle line:90%
astrophysicist.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And that was the hypothesis
he had for many years.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.917 align:middle line:84%
But he actually at one
point went so far--

00:25:22.917 --> 00:25:24.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
he is on this now--

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.890 align:middle line:84%
so far as to say he felt
that the binary companion

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:90%
was the star Sirius.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it kept
coming up in ancient--

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.775 align:middle line:84%
particularly Egyptian--
not mythology but history.

00:25:38.775 --> 00:25:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's possible
it's a trinary.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.550 align:middle line:84%
But the one that I discovered
has now been labeled Biden.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Biden.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:46.255 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And it's
just outside--

00:25:46.255 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:47.400 align:middle line:90%
Like Joe Biden?

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, I know.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seriously.

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:48.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:49.700 align:middle line:90%
Biden.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Very weird.

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:51.977 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Does he know this?

00:25:51.977 --> 00:25:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I think
he does by now.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.420 align:middle line:84%
They made a whole thing
about it on the news,

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and they brought
an astrophysicist.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And he showed the
location of this object.

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:02.713 align:middle line:10%
And he said there's a solar
system in our solar system,

00:26:02.713 --> 00:26:04.380 align:middle line:10%
and it's just outside
the orbit of Pluto

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.970 align:middle line:10%
but inside the Oort cloud.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: And then he says--

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:09.175 align:middle line:90%
it's on my YouTube channel.

00:26:09.175 --> 00:26:11.570 align:middle line:84%
He says, this is
where we came from.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:12.980 align:middle line:90%
That's his exact words.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.440 align:middle line:84%
He said, we're seeing this
is where we came from.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.272 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, wow.

00:26:16.272 --> 00:26:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That gave birth
to this solar system.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:21.420 align:middle line:84%
That would mean that our
sun was newer theoretically.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.150 align:middle line:90%
Possibly.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.885 align:middle line:84%
Or that it was a
captured brown dwarf.

00:26:26.885 --> 00:26:28.010 align:middle line:90%
Because that happens a lot.

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:29.885 align:middle line:84%
You have these rogue
planets with rogue suns.

00:26:29.885 --> 00:26:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's about
the implication of that.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.667 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think not all
but a lot of our viewers

00:26:34.667 --> 00:26:36.500 align:middle line:84%
have heard of the
procession of the equinox.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.417 align:middle line:84%
We've had lots of guests
on through the years.

00:26:38.417 --> 00:26:41.210 align:middle line:84%
But what is the implication
of being in a binary star

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.203 align:middle line:84%
system where you're solar,
where your sun is a binary star?

00:26:44.203 --> 00:26:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well,
the implication is

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.690 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
have at different times

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:50.450 align:middle line:84%
during the solar
cycle where you're

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:52.670 align:middle line:84%
going to have more
gravitational waves coming

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.045 align:middle line:90%
through your solar system.

00:26:54.045 --> 00:26:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's
happening now.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:59.360 align:middle line:84%
So the global warming is
not just an effect of cows

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.700 align:middle line:84%
passing gas and
exhaust from your car.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.383 align:middle line:84%
It's also from these
gravitational waves

00:27:03.383 --> 00:27:05.300 align:middle line:84%
that are emanating from
this other brown dwarf

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.690 align:middle line:90%
as it gets closer to our sun.

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Every planet in our
solar system right

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:13.280 align:middle line:84%
now is experiencing global
warming, every single one.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.290 align:middle line:90%
Mars, the ice caps are melting.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:16.770 align:middle line:90%
Saturn's core is melting.

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Scientists said that if we were
there, we'd be dead already.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.937 align:middle line:84%
All the ice caps are
melting everywhere.

00:27:20.937 --> 00:27:23.678 align:middle line:84%
Io is having more
geysers than ever.

00:27:23.678 --> 00:27:25.220 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that's happening

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.090 align:middle line:84%
from gravitational waves
because energy in--

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.907 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's just like the
old saying, E equals mc squared.

00:27:29.907 --> 00:27:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Energy is coming in.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:31.640 align:middle line:90%
It's going to magnify.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.557 align:middle line:90%
It's going to vibrate.

00:27:32.557 --> 00:27:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And as those suns and moons
orbit their solar bodies,

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.670 align:middle line:84%
they're also going to
expand and contract.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
cause more friction.

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So now you're multiplying that
with these gravitational waves,

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.948 align:middle line:84%
which is going to then
heat up the planet

00:27:42.948 --> 00:27:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and cause other calamities and
catastrophes if we were there.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, here on Earth, we're
talking about more tornadoes,

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:54.043 align:middle line:84%
bigger and stronger hurricanes,
mudslides, torrential rains.

00:27:54.043 --> 00:27:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything
we're seeing.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Everything
we're seeing right now.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you do
this with your fingers,

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:00.892 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
in a companion system,

00:28:00.892 --> 00:28:02.600 align:middle line:84%
there are points at
which these are going

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.800 align:middle line:90%
to come closer to each other.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're going to
be going like an elliptical,

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.180 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And as they come closer is when
these waves start affecting.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:13.435 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
seeing right now.

00:28:13.435 --> 00:28:16.550 align:middle line:10%
And Gregg Braden said
it well in the show here

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:19.832 align:middle line:10%
on Gaia where he's talking
about the ice cores.

00:28:19.832 --> 00:28:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at the ice cores,

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:24.110 align:middle line:84%
you can see different
times when this object

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:26.660 align:middle line:84%
has affected our solar system
and caused these global warming

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:27.750 align:middle line:90%
cycles.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.375 align:middle line:84%
And it's there in the ice cores
that it's happening every 4,200

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:33.590 align:middle line:84%
years or so just as the
astrophysicists said

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:35.870 align:middle line:84%
on the network about
the actual orbit

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.073 align:middle line:90%
of this particular object.

00:28:38.073 --> 00:28:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And actually, for me, it was
Gregg Braden back in the early

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.790 align:middle line:90%
'90s and reading his--

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:47.750 align:middle line:84%
I think was called "Zero Point,"
that first little kind of glued

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.580 align:middle line:84%
together book called
"Zero Point," which

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.490 align:middle line:84%
talked about the magnetic
field and the dissipation

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.250 align:middle line:84%
of the magnetic field
at this period of time.

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.940 align:middle line:84%
That has serious
implications for every life

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.560 align:middle line:90%
form on this planet.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.210 align:middle line:90%
So can you talk to that?

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't think
most people understand.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Gregg stopped talking about it.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.080 align:middle line:90%
But you can.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's like this
invisible elephant in the room

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:16.730 align:middle line:90%
that no one talks about.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:18.105 align:middle line:84%
I think we need
to talk about it.

00:29:18.105 --> 00:29:20.232 align:middle line:84%
This affects the way
our brains function.

00:29:20.232 --> 00:29:21.440 align:middle line:90%
It affects our immune system.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.810 align:middle line:84%
It affects plants and
trees and animals.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:25.323 align:middle line:84%
Please tell us what
happens when you

00:29:25.323 --> 00:29:27.490 align:middle line:84%
have a reduction in the
magnetic field to lifeforms.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It affects
your psychotic rhythm.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:32.690 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about genetically
modifying your DNA in a way.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.693 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize
that magnetic fields flow

00:29:34.693 --> 00:29:36.110 align:middle line:84%
in and throughout
your entire body

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:39.420 align:middle line:84%
and interact with your DNA on
a daily basis, 24 hours a day,

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.310 align:middle line:90%
seven days a week.

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:44.060 align:middle line:84%
So when it starts to change
and reduce or increase,

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.550 align:middle line:84%
then the DNA responds
in different ways.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:49.700 align:middle line:84%
It can cause different
things like bad replication.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.287 align:middle line:90%
It can cause tumors.

00:29:51.287 --> 00:29:53.120 align:middle line:84%
It can cause memory
loss, believe it or not,

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.953 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of memories
are stored in DNA.

00:29:54.953 --> 00:29:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's already been
proven that magnetics

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.140 align:middle line:84%
have an effect on stored memory,
which is why we went away

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.880 align:middle line:90%
from VHS tapes.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.340 align:middle line:84%
VHS tapes were getting
erased by the magnetic field

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.420 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.878 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: See, that's the part
that nobody tells you about.

00:30:07.878 --> 00:30:08.678 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:30:08.678 --> 00:30:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I find it
absolutely fascinating.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:15.530 align:middle line:84%
At one point I was told
that because the mind

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:18.775 align:middle line:84%
is very dependent on a
stable magnetic field

00:30:18.775 --> 00:30:20.150 align:middle line:84%
that what we would
start seeing--

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not saying
this to scare anybody.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.573 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, let's just be
aware, do what you can.

00:30:24.573 --> 00:30:26.240 align:middle line:84%
You have a wonderful
little device here.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.070 align:middle line:90%
There are things we can do.

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:30.770 align:middle line:84%
That the human
species would start

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.340 align:middle line:84%
going through kind of
almost in mass, memory loss,

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and then moving towards
something that almost looks

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:40.250 align:middle line:90%
more like insanity of sorts.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:44.120 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like, you know,
you see the old movies with

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.050 align:middle line:84%
the people walking around like
they're drones or they're--

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:49.610 align:middle line:84%
but what happens is
literally is in our brains

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:52.590 align:middle line:84%
our millions or actually
billions of magnetite crystals.

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And they interact
with the magnetic field.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've been
kind of disconnected

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.740 align:middle line:84%
from really feeling that
sensation because of what

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.750 align:middle line:84%
are called our
junk DNA, which was

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:04.040 align:middle line:90%
done about 200,000 years ago.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:04.910 align:middle line:90%
We'll get into that later.

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, do.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:07.795 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: But what
happens is we still

00:31:07.795 --> 00:31:09.170 align:middle line:84%
interact with that
magnetic field

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:10.587 align:middle line:84%
with those magnetite
crystals that

00:31:10.587 --> 00:31:12.740 align:middle line:84%
are in our brains on
a consistent basis.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.492 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us
the stabilization.

00:31:14.492 --> 00:31:15.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, we used
to be able to use

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:18.830 align:middle line:84%
it to navigate the planet
just like birds and turtles

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:20.330 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's still a vital
part of the human psyche.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you throw that
off, then all of a sudden,

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.130 align:middle line:84%
you can have things like
psychosis, bipolarism.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:29.630 align:middle line:84%
All these different
things come out.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which we're
seeing everywhere.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Mm-hmm.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:31.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
becoming common.

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, and
we look to point fingers

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.340 align:middle line:90%
as to where it's coming from.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.740 align:middle line:84%
We look to the obvious things
like, well, it's vaccines,

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:44.720 align:middle line:84%
it's food sources, it's EMFs,
radio frequencies, and so

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.690 align:middle line:90%
forth.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:47.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually
something that's

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:48.970 align:middle line:84%
the underpinnings
even beneath that.

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:50.660 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you're going
to have-- like, you could have

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:54.020 align:middle line:84%
potentially like a
zombie apocalypse

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.570 align:middle line:84%
happening, which is kind of
what you see happening with some

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:59.010 align:middle line:84%
of the psychosis that's going
on on the planet right now.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people are
just being given more drugs,

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:04.320 align:middle line:84%
but they're not treating
the real problem.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, Billy, I
mean, this is something

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:10.700 align:middle line:84%
that I've been interested in and
concerned about for a long time

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.100 align:middle line:84%
because no one knows
it's happening.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.427 align:middle line:84%
And we're all pointing
our fingers at each other,

00:32:15.427 --> 00:32:16.760 align:middle line:90%
and I think in the wrong places.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Not that those other things
can't exacerbate the problem.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:22.790 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about what you do do

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:25.730 align:middle line:84%
when you're in a diminished
magnetic atmosphere so we

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:28.770 align:middle line:84%
can protect our
brains, our everything.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:32.112 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, technologically
we've had to make adjustments

00:32:32.112 --> 00:32:34.160 align:middle line:84%
because magnetic north
has moved from true north

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.340 align:middle line:90%
down to Russia right now.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And they've even had
to renumber the airport runways

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.540 align:middle line:84%
so that planes can
know where to land.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.490 align:middle line:90%
That's how powerful this is.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.160 align:middle line:84%
But what we can do
as a species is we

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.270 align:middle line:84%
need to first dig in
deep to ourselves.

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:50.330 align:middle line:84%
We have to get
into more focused.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.830 align:middle line:84%
We have to be able
to meditate more.

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:53.520 align:middle line:84%
I think meditation
is really key.

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Different types of
meditations as well-- there's

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.010 align:middle line:84%
different meditations for
different types of things.

00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:00.970 align:middle line:84%
There's meditations
for manifestation

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:02.550 align:middle line:90%
of things into your life.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:06.490 align:middle line:84%
There's meditation to reduce the
amount of input into your mind

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and let the cosmic energy
feel you so that you can get

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.072 align:middle line:90%
more insight and understanding.

00:33:10.072 --> 00:33:12.114 align:middle line:84%
And there's also a meditation
for health as well.

00:33:12.114 --> 00:33:14.364 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we need to
focus on more meditations.

00:33:14.364 --> 00:33:15.490 align:middle line:90%
I think that's really key.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And it will give us a
stabilization factor

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.540 align:middle line:90%
on our bodies.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And as well as the other
thing is eating better.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:25.850 align:middle line:84%
We're getting poisoned
everywhere we turn.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's almost like,
what can I eat anymore?

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.220 align:middle line:84%
But we really have to emphasize
and put more focus in on that

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and reduce the amount of
poisoning we're taking in.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Because we're just
compounding the problem.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And I think that's one
of the biggest issues we have--

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.605 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think these
are both really big issues.

00:33:40.605 --> 00:33:44.420 align:middle line:84%
But also you have various people
inventing little devices, even

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.360 align:middle line:84%
medallions and such that you
can wear that supposedly hold

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.880 align:middle line:84%
a stable magnetic field
just immediately surrounding

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.835 align:middle line:90%
the body.

00:33:50.835 --> 00:33:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Do you know about some of
those and what their true value

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:54.420 align:middle line:90%
may or may not be or--

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's some EMF
protectors and so forth.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:01.400 align:middle line:84%
This is like the flower of
life made out of pure silver.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Those things have been proven
like under real experiments

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.640 align:middle line:90%
to actually reduce the EMFs.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.110 align:middle line:90%
So yes, it will work.

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:10.014 align:middle line:90%
But you know--

00:34:10.014 --> 00:34:12.139 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about pumping
up the magnetic field,

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:13.820 align:middle line:84%
taking it into a
little higher range,

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:15.915 align:middle line:84%
at least surrounding
your own personal body?

00:34:15.915 --> 00:34:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, that's
the thing that--

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.730 align:middle line:84%
I use those-- like in the
back of my cell phone,

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.431 align:middle line:90%
I have one of those protectors.

00:34:21.431 --> 00:34:23.389 align:middle line:84%
Anything I can to reduce
the amount of exposure

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:24.656 align:middle line:90%
that I'm getting.

00:34:24.656 --> 00:34:26.989 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that I do is a
lot of people don't realize

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:29.120 align:middle line:90%
is we all have chi energy.

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:33.139 align:middle line:84%
And I actually envision my chi
energy coming out of my body,

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:37.100 align:middle line:84%
out of my head, splitting around
and encasing my entire body.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And I literally walk around
like that for the day.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.885 align:middle line:84%
And when I feel it getting
low, I do it again.

00:34:41.885 --> 00:34:44.135 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may sound like
something crazy to some people.

00:34:44.135 --> 00:34:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it doesn't at all.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.489 align:middle line:90%
Not to this audience.

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: OK.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:46.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.920 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, I've only had
eight colds in my entire life.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.679 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And I attribute
that to my chi energy,

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:53.750 align:middle line:84%
because when people sneeze
and cough around me,

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:57.320 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it hits my outside
shield, and it bounces off.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And I've coached
children and kids

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.530 align:middle line:84%
and been around schools
and everything else,

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and everybody's always
sick, but I only

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.180 align:middle line:84%
had eight colds
in my entire life.

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when
did you discover

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:06.950 align:middle line:84%
this, and how long have you
been employing that practice?

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: One day
somebody sneezed by me,

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:10.020 align:middle line:90%
and it got on me.

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.440 align:middle line:84%
The actual sneeze got
on me, like, the saliva.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.880 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh my god.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment-- this
was about 30 years ago.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.730 align:middle line:90%
It was a very long time ago.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:19.840 align:middle line:90%
I was a teenager, I think I was.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.400 align:middle line:90%
No, it was just in my 20s.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.215 align:middle line:84%
And I said to myself,
if I can make a force

00:35:24.215 --> 00:35:26.580 align:middle line:84%
field around myself to
prevent that from happening,

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:27.413 align:middle line:90%
that would be great.

00:35:27.413 --> 00:35:28.313 align:middle line:90%
I just thought it.

00:35:28.313 --> 00:35:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And I said, let me just
try it in my own mind.

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And I literally tried it,
and I felt like it worked.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:34.880 align:middle line:84%
I felt something literally
coming out of my head

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.840 align:middle line:90%
and working.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, I'm just
going to do it from this point

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:38.630 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:40.588 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether it's working
or not, I don't know.

00:35:40.588 --> 00:35:42.920 align:middle line:84%
But I can just tell you
that for me, hardly ever

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.950 align:middle line:84%
being sick, coaching
unlimited amounts of games

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and being around
so many children.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And you know, they're sneezing
and coughing and bringing

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.390 align:middle line:84%
in germs in all the
time, 24/7, traveling

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:53.390 align:middle line:90%
around the entire world.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I've been around the world
twice to all these countries

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:57.772 align:middle line:84%
and everything else and not
getting sick all the time.

00:35:57.772 --> 00:35:58.730 align:middle line:90%
I attribute it to that.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:01.218 align:middle line:84%
I just have to say, that's
probably what it was for me.

00:36:01.218 --> 00:36:02.510 align:middle line:90%
That's just what I feel it was.

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:04.052 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
for sharing that.

00:36:04.052 --> 00:36:07.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now let's go ahead--
you teased us a little bit ago,

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:08.660 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Junk DNA, which is
just to me such a joke.

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know?

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you're somehow
born with 95% junk DNA.

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:17.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah right.

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:19.580 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back
now into the story.

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And this takes us back toward,
like you said, a couple hundred

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:24.740 align:middle line:90%
thousand years ago.

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Not the beginning,
but ancient enough

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:30.960 align:middle line:84%
times that that's where
our story became corrupted.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.585 align:middle line:84%
And let's start
talking about that.

00:36:32.585 --> 00:36:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, I really do feel
like the existing hominid that

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:37.550 align:middle line:84%
was on this planet
long before we got here

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:40.940 align:middle line:84%
as Homo sapiens sapiens was
some other type of hominid,

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.530 align:middle line:90%
probably our cousins.

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And according to a lot
of the ancient text,

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:48.500 align:middle line:84%
around 200,000 years ago, they
began to genetically modify

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.550 align:middle line:90%
these existing hominids.

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:52.940 align:middle line:84%
It's been a little bit of
a misleading thing going on

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.740 align:middle line:84%
in some of the ancient
community and some

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.910 align:middle line:84%
of the truth-seeking
community where

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:58.100 align:middle line:84%
they think that these
Anunnaki, or these Atlanteans

00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.400 align:middle line:90%
created human beings.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: That's not accurate.

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's not accurate.

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.877 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: We were already here.

00:37:02.877 --> 00:37:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:05.183 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They decided
to genetically modify

00:37:05.183 --> 00:37:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and manipulate us
to work for them

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:09.700 align:middle line:90%
and do their bidding basically.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Modern-day biologists
and scientists

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:14.765 align:middle line:84%
have discovered that some
of these modifications

00:37:14.765 --> 00:37:16.640 align:middle line:84%
to the human body to
the Homo sapiens sapiens

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.010 align:middle line:84%
happened around 200,000 years
ago, ironically the same amount

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:20.840 align:middle line:84%
of time that the Enuma
Elish and The Seven

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Tablets of Creation,
the Atra-Hasis

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:23.900 align:middle line:90%
epic, the Epic of Gilgamesh.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.317 align:middle line:84%
All these different
epics that you

00:37:25.317 --> 00:37:27.050 align:middle line:84%
read from these ancient
Sumerian tablets,

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:28.675 align:middle line:84%
they start to talk
about this happening

00:37:28.675 --> 00:37:32.810 align:middle line:84%
around that time, even the
modification of chromosome

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:35.210 align:middle line:84%
number 2 and the addition
of these telomeres

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.820 align:middle line:84%
that basically shrink
on chromosome number 2.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.327 align:middle line:84%
That's all about 200,000
years ago as well.

00:37:40.327 --> 00:37:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Telomeres-- did
they used to not shrink?

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:43.827 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They
used to not shrink.

00:37:43.827 --> 00:37:45.687 align:middle line:84%
They would, but at
a very slow pace.

00:37:45.687 --> 00:37:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Instead now they're
shrinking and breaking off

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.240 align:middle line:84%
to the extent where
our lifespan is

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.650 align:middle line:90%
limited to less than 100 years.

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That didn't
used to be the case.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Not the case.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.340 align:middle line:84%
People were living for
thousands of years back then.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.560 align:middle line:90%
It's documented.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.727 align:middle line:84%
And even what happened was
during the Tower of Babel

00:37:59.727 --> 00:38:01.602 align:middle line:84%
incident, which is
written about in the Bible

00:38:01.602 --> 00:38:03.560 align:middle line:84%
but copied from the
ancient Sumerian tablets,

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Enlil, who's known as Yahweh
in the modern-day Bible,

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.017 align:middle line:84%
came back and saw
it and realized,

00:38:07.017 --> 00:38:09.590 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, human beings can
achieve anything they want.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:11.707 align:middle line:84%
And it actually says
that in the Bible.

00:38:11.707 --> 00:38:13.790 align:middle line:84%
They can achieve anything
they set their minds to.

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:15.832 align:middle line:84%
He said, my seed should
not abide in man forever.

00:38:15.832 --> 00:38:17.190 align:middle line:90%
His years will be be 120.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:19.653 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the genetic
modification occurred.

00:38:19.653 --> 00:38:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I believe that
the chromosome number 2 was

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:24.317 align:middle line:84%
altered, and that reduced
our lifespan time.

00:38:24.317 --> 00:38:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
just take a moment here,

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.670 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to
go tangential for a sec.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:31.070 align:middle line:84%
At that statement
and that discovery,

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:34.250 align:middle line:84%
the understanding was that
the human being that already

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:39.020 align:middle line:84%
existed here on this planet had
incredible creative manifesting

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.430 align:middle line:90%
capabilities.

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:42.250 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Already just as good
or as qualified as they

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.230 align:middle line:84%
were to become a
space-faring race.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:50.460 align:middle line:84%
He realized it at that
moment, so what did he do?

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.010 align:middle line:90%
He destroyed the Tower of Babel.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the Bible, this
God-- they say it's God,

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:56.270 align:middle line:84%
but it's really this Enlil
character who did it.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:58.093 align:middle line:84%
It was copied from
the ancient tablets.

00:38:58.093 --> 00:39:00.510 align:middle line:84%
He destroyed it, and then he
split the people up, put them

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:02.052 align:middle line:84%
around different
parts of the planet,

00:39:02.052 --> 00:39:03.180 align:middle line:90%
and changed the languages--

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: --so that they
couldn't communicate

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:06.500 align:middle line:90%
and work together anymore.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Made us enemies of each other,
so brother fighting brother

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.710 align:middle line:84%
so that we can't realize
who the true enemy was.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this has
gone on since then.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Let me just then kind of
go on another little track

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:16.520 align:middle line:90%
for a moment.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:20.840 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the Aboriginals
in Australia, for example,

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:24.350 align:middle line:84%
they have not lost that ability
to navigate and communicate

00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and be part of the cosmos, those
capabilities we all once had.

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.753 align:middle line:84%
It seems like they were
exempt from the manipulations.

00:39:30.753 --> 00:39:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, I talked to
some of the Aboriginal elders.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And I'm going
to go visit there actually

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.840 align:middle line:90%
this winter.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.132 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, tell us about
this because it's giving us

00:39:38.132 --> 00:39:39.740 align:middle line:90%
a glimpse of what we once were.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Oh,
yeah, it's amazing.

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:41.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean, their story is--

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.280 align:middle line:84%
they're from the
Pleiadian star cluster.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.780 align:middle line:84%
They were seated
here by Pleiadians.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:48.420 align:middle line:84%
This is their handed
down verbal history.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.550 align:middle line:90%
They truly believe it.

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:51.920 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of
extraordinary capabilities,

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.330 align:middle line:84%
extrasensory perceptions
that the average person just

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:55.130 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have.

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:55.920 align:middle line:90%
They still have it.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And there's a place
down there called Kariong Nine

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:00.910 align:middle line:84%
in Australia where there's
a partially uncovered

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian temple where
the Egyptians would

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:06.358 align:middle line:84%
go there to visit and
learn from the Aboriginals.

00:40:06.358 --> 00:40:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they
hadn't been tampered with.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.268 align:middle line:90%
That was the main reason why.

00:40:10.268 --> 00:40:11.070 align:middle line:90%
They were pure.

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And they would sit
with the elders.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:13.170 align:middle line:90%
They would go for walkabouts.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:14.610 align:middle line:84%
They would learn
directly from them.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:16.818 align:middle line:84%
And they would write about
this in this temple, which

00:40:16.818 --> 00:40:17.790 align:middle line:90%
is etched into stone.

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
go back to Egypt.

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you know of
any other groups of people

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.900 align:middle line:84%
around this planet that
were untampered with?

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:28.282 align:middle line:84%
And was that just simply a
matter of location, geography?

00:40:28.282 --> 00:40:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, I don't know.

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
didn't show up there?

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:32.230 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: It's a hard
place to get to, but--

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.450 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, you know-- but
I don't know of any others.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I don't either.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They're
really, really unique.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And the story-- the fact
that they're saying that

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:39.870 align:middle line:90%
they're from the Pleaides--

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: --that's amazing
to me and that they

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.130 align:middle line:84%
were the first seated
people on this planet.

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the
last show I just did

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:48.180 align:middle line:84%
was with a man named
Jason Quitt, who

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.620 align:middle line:84%
started having
dreams and becoming

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:54.750 align:middle line:84%
in contact with a pharaonic
line Egyptian passing

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:58.410 align:middle line:84%
knowledge on that was
said to have originated

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:02.400 align:middle line:84%
from the Pleiades through
Atlantis down into Egypt,

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.730 align:middle line:84%
captured in stone in Egypt
for us to resurrect today.

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Again this same Pleiadian
introduction of this knowledge.

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I think it
was more to remind us,

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:14.400 align:middle line:84%
help us remember what
we were once capable of.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is the part of the
story that just really ticks me

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.010 align:middle line:84%
off that we were tampered
with in this way.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.730 align:middle line:90%
So you-- carry on the story now.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, we've
basically been mind-wiped.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: There's
a movie that I'm

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.160 align:middle line:84%
working on called
"Chronicles of the Anunnaki,"

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and the opening scene
is in the Pleiadian star

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.697 align:middle line:84%
cluster with a galactic
war between the Lyrans

00:41:29.697 --> 00:41:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and the Sirians,
because I really

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:33.150 align:middle line:84%
do believe that there
was a galactic war there

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and that what happened was
the refugees from the remnants

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:38.700 align:middle line:84%
of whoever survived left out
of there, went to the Orion,

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:40.200 align:middle line:90%
went to Sirius.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And some might have crash-landed
on this Nibiru planet, which

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:45.600 align:middle line:84%
was talked about in the Enuma
Elish, which was eventually

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.270 align:middle line:84%
captured by our solar system
with this brown dwarf star.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.728 align:middle line:84%
And this is why you have ancient
accounts of these Anunnaki

00:41:50.728 --> 00:41:53.020 align:middle line:84%
people, or these Atlanteans,
coming from different star

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:53.860 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.830 align:middle line:84%
It's always specific
star systems.

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And the Great Pyramid is
aligned with these specific star

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.280 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And I believe for a
couple of reasons.

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:02.290 align:middle line:84%
One is because that's
where they came from

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:04.832 align:middle line:84%
and also that the Great Pyramid
was probably a communications

00:42:04.832 --> 00:42:06.270 align:middle line:84%
device, and through
those shafts,

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:08.427 align:middle line:84%
through some type of
subspace frequency,

00:42:08.427 --> 00:42:10.260 align:middle line:84%
they would be in direct
contact with whoever

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.170 align:middle line:90%
was on those planets.

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:13.655 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I do believe that,
that that's at least in part

00:42:13.655 --> 00:42:15.780 align:middle line:84%
what they were-- because
they were created by them,

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:16.880 align:middle line:90%
for them essentially.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.680 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.040 align:middle line:90%
They're not for humans, per se.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: No.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Except perhaps a few
of the unique Pharaohs,

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:24.940 align:middle line:84%
which also have these
bloodlines of star people.

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the human being
was tampered with then.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Now we're moving
the story forward

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:34.440 align:middle line:84%
into where it becomes
of interest again

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.840 align:middle line:84%
and reintroduction into
modern society today.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.400 align:middle line:90%
Why is this happening now?

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.630 align:middle line:90%
Why are we remembering?

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Why are we waking up?

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Why are we beginning to tell
these stories to each other

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:43.400 align:middle line:90%
again?

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, you know,
something amazing about DNA,

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.120 align:middle line:84%
it has an amazing
storage capacity.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.920 align:middle line:84%
One gram of DNA,
which is enough to put

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.503 align:middle line:84%
a tiny drop on the
tip of your finger,

00:42:51.503 --> 00:42:53.620 align:middle line:90%
can store 433 petabytes of data.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Absolute
zeros and ones data.

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.930 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was this
scientist named George Church,

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:01.890 align:middle line:90%
he actually created an e-book.

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:05.605 align:middle line:84%
And he then downloaded
the e-book to the DNA.

00:43:05.605 --> 00:43:06.730 align:middle line:90%
He said this is incredible.

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:09.120 align:middle line:84%
It can take downloads
from a server and upload

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.720 align:middle line:90%
back to the server again.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.590 align:middle line:84%
That's when he realized, this
is a digital binary code.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.230 align:middle line:84%
He said, let me replicate the
book as many times as I can.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:19.100 align:middle line:84%
He replicated it I think 80
million times or 80 billion

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:20.580 align:middle line:90%
times, some ridiculous number.

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.590 align:middle line:84%
That's when I said,
this is outrageous.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And I had been talking
about DNA being used

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:26.740 align:middle line:90%
as hard drive for 10 years.

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And now
Microsoft finally did it.

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:29.790 align:middle line:90%
They just came out--

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:31.415 align:middle line:84%
I think about three
or four months ago,

00:43:31.415 --> 00:43:33.570 align:middle line:84%
they announced a
DNA storage drive.

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.030 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that part.

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:middle line:84%
This is my
understanding too that

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:42.720 align:middle line:84%
when we start considering
reincarnations patterns that it

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.820 align:middle line:90%
is tied in through the DNA.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And there is a very
practical reason for that,

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:51.970 align:middle line:84%
to continue coming back into
that familiar DNA pattern.

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:54.353 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about of that.

00:43:54.353 --> 00:43:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, well, see, DNA
not only can be plugged in,

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:58.320 align:middle line:90%
but it's also wireless.

00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:58.770 --> 00:43:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So the
beautiful thing about it

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:02.577 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that it can send and
receive information wirelessly.

00:44:02.577 --> 00:44:04.260 align:middle line:84%
It's already
scientifically proven.

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And so as information
comes into the DNA

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:09.432 align:middle line:84%
and it's downloaded into
the DNA, it's stored there.

00:44:09.432 --> 00:44:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And as you pass from generation
to generation, some of that

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:13.305 align:middle line:84%
makes it into the
next generation.

00:44:13.305 --> 00:44:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.183 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And I think that
through the mind wiping

00:44:16.183 --> 00:44:18.780 align:middle line:84%
that we went through and through
some genetic modifications,

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:20.740 align:middle line:84%
there was a diminishing of
some of the information.

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.540 align:middle line:84%
But it was always locked
in there and stored.

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And now it's
coming back free again.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:27.990 align:middle line:84%
It's found its way back into
the genome, found its way back

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:30.380 align:middle line:84%
into the core where
we can tap into it.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people all over the
world are starting to wake up.

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
ancient remnant memories

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:35.910 align:middle line:90%
are coming back to us.

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Even when people say,
oh, I got an idea to do this

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.595 align:middle line:84%
or I got an idea
or an invention,

00:44:39.595 --> 00:44:41.683 align:middle line:84%
that stuff was already
just in your DNA,

00:44:41.683 --> 00:44:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and you just tapped
into the information

00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:44.680 align:middle line:90%
and unlocked it again.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.880 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely-- I love this,
and I absolutely agree with it.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So let's maybe extend
the conversation now

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.010 align:middle line:84%
to what happened
that is allowing us

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:54.300 align:middle line:90%
at this point in history.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:55.675 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because
if you're looking

00:44:55.675 --> 00:44:59.880 align:middle line:84%
at the phenomena of these
gravitational waves, right,

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.550 align:middle line:84%
you've got the phenomena of the
Earth's own frequency shifting,

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:03.920 align:middle line:90%
the magnetic field dropping.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.670 align:middle line:84%
You've got a lot
going on at one time.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Where in this whole mix
do we little human beings

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:10.350 align:middle line:84%
start, like, suddenly
flowering again?

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:11.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I know, right?

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Among the insanity
that's also cropping up.

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, it's amazing
because in the Emerald Tablets,

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Thoth talks about the fact
that he wrote these tablets

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:22.990 align:middle line:84%
for a new human being being
birthed under a new sun, which

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:24.338 align:middle line:90%
is us in this day and age.

00:45:24.338 --> 00:45:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think what he was
referring to was the fact

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.713 align:middle line:84%
around 2012-- which I knew
was never going to be the end

00:45:28.713 --> 00:45:30.550 align:middle line:84%
of the world, just
another phase shift--

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:32.800 align:middle line:84%
our solar system, which
undulates up and down

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.990 align:middle line:84%
the galactic equator
every so many tens

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:37.390 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of years, well,
we reached the center of it.

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Right now we're still
hovering at the center

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:39.850 align:middle line:84%
of the galactic
equator, which means

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:41.850 align:middle line:84%
the majority of the cosmic
rays of energy coming

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:44.500 align:middle line:84%
from the galactic center
is emanating right into us,

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:46.720 align:middle line:84%
through us, and
all into our DNA,

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.430 align:middle line:90%
into our brains, everything.

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that the
magnetic field is diminished,

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:53.260 align:middle line:84%
it's allowing all that
to come in even more.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.485 align:middle line:84%
So now we're absorbing
more of this cosmic energy

00:45:55.485 --> 00:45:56.860 align:middle line:84%
directly from the
galactic center

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.620 align:middle line:84%
from the supermassive black hole
at the center of our galaxy.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's coming into us
and altering our DNA,

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:04.960 align:middle line:84%
reviving us, waking us
up, reconnecting strands,

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.985 align:middle line:84%
and letting us realize and
remember who we truly are.

00:46:07.985 --> 00:46:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:11.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy to
have you say this.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago, I
was in a conversation

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.700 align:middle line:84%
with a physicist named Mark
Cummings, who is actually

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:17.980 align:middle line:90%
Russell Targ's son-in-law.

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying, the black
hole, Regina it's a plenum.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:23.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a plenum.

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:27.070 align:middle line:84%
All the information is pouring
through the black holes.

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:28.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not just
something that sucks

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.100 align:middle line:90%
the life out of everything.

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.090 align:middle line:90%
So tell us the black holes--

00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:34.430 align:middle line:84%
tell us the story of black
holes from that perspective.

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, listen,
black holes store everything.

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:38.600 align:middle line:84%
They used to think that when
you went into a black hole,

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.030 align:middle line:84%
you would be disintegrated,
and you would just die,

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.710 align:middle line:90%
and that was the end of that.

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.083 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Black holes
take information

00:46:43.083 --> 00:46:45.377 align:middle line:84%
and store the information
on the event horizon.

00:46:45.377 --> 00:46:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And now because of
that, we discovered

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:50.237 align:middle line:84%
that everything in the third
dimension is always stored.

00:46:50.237 --> 00:46:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Energy can't be destroyed.

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.750 align:middle line:90%
It can only be transformed.

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And black holes are
like data portals.

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.440 align:middle line:84%
They hold googols of information
on the event horizon.

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.782 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And then because of
the irradiation that they emit,

00:47:00.782 --> 00:47:02.950 align:middle line:84%
which Stephen Hawking
realized and told

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:04.600 align:middle line:84%
everybody about,
that actually has

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.623 align:middle line:84%
these bursts of these
x-rays and radiation

00:47:06.623 --> 00:47:08.290 align:middle line:84%
that goes out and
sends that information

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:10.840 align:middle line:84%
back out into the universe as
these different rays, which

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:12.970 align:middle line:84%
interact with our body,
interact with our DNA,

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and put information
directly into us.

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's what a lot of
people don't know about.

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about the
event horizon for those

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:19.573 align:middle line:90%
who don't understand that.

00:47:19.573 --> 00:47:20.948 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well,
the event horizon

00:47:20.948 --> 00:47:22.450 align:middle line:84%
is the part of the
black hole right

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:25.400 align:middle line:84%
before you get to the part
where light can't even escape.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:26.895 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: And on that horizon--

00:47:26.895 --> 00:47:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it becomes
into the visible spectrum,

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:30.710 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, at
the event horizon.

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:32.085 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah,
as it's absorbing

00:47:32.085 --> 00:47:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and as it's gravitationally
pulling everything in,

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.850 align:middle line:90%
it heats up.

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:36.650 align:middle line:90%
So it lights up.

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:38.350 align:middle line:84%
This is how we can see black
holes because of the event

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:38.770 align:middle line:90%
horizon.

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:39.670 align:middle line:84%
If it wasn't for
that, we wouldn't even

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:40.060 align:middle line:90%
know they existed.

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There
would be no contrast.

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So that gives us
the contrast, and we

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.640 align:middle line:84%
go, OK, this is where the
edge of the black hole--

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.490 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, stars
that orbit close spin so fast

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:50.410 align:middle line:84%
around it, you know, that they
probably-- if you were there,

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:52.368 align:middle line:84%
you would probably be
experiencing on some type

00:47:52.368 --> 00:47:53.220 align:middle line:90%
of a timed dilation.

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: But this event
horizon, as things cross over,

00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:59.620 align:middle line:84%
it takes the information
from whatever the object is

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.930 align:middle line:84%
and breaks it down and stores
that information directly

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:05.520 align:middle line:84%
on the horizon, and nothing
really goes down and becomes

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.320 align:middle line:90%
this--

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:07.950 align:middle line:84%
to the finite point
and disintegrates.

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:10.300 align:middle line:90%
So it's stored there.

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:12.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's this plenum
of information

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:16.550 align:middle line:84%
that can burst forth these waves
of information, so to speak.

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And are you saying that this
binary star or even trinary

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.790 align:middle line:84%
star system in the
position we're in

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:24.100 align:middle line:84%
at the galactic
center, having them

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.620 align:middle line:84%
closer to each other and
these gravitational waves

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:28.780 align:middle line:84%
are what's allowing the
transference of this data

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.075 align:middle line:84%
from the black hole
into our beings,

00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:32.075 align:middle line:90%
our planet, our species?

00:48:32.075 --> 00:48:33.825 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: That's exactly
what's happening.

00:48:33.825 --> 00:48:35.800 align:middle line:84%
See, as this other
brown dwarf gets closer,

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:39.400 align:middle line:84%
it's bending our magnetic field
and warping in a weird way.

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Anybody could look this up
and look at the science data.

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:44.770 align:middle line:84%
The magnetic field is available
online for anybody to look at.

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:46.630 align:middle line:84%
You can see how it's
warped and bent.

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:48.592 align:middle line:84%
And so that diminishing
bending and twisting

00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:50.800 align:middle line:84%
of the magnetic field, as
it's getting ready probably

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.770 align:middle line:84%
to do some type of a flip, at
the same exact time that we're

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:57.010 align:middle line:84%
at the galactic equator, it's
a great time to be alive.

00:48:57.010 --> 00:48:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
going to say, it is wild.

00:48:59.050 --> 00:48:59.890 align:middle line:90%
It's chaotic.

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:00.920 align:middle line:90%
It's scary.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's so exciting.

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:05.160 align:middle line:84%
We're like the pioneers
of a whole new wave that's

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.380 align:middle line:84%
going to happen, a whole
new type of Homo sapien

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.880 align:middle line:84%
that's moving forward into the
future, a whole new evolution

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:11.450 align:middle line:90%
of the species right now.

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, we
notice that so many people

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:19.930 align:middle line:84%
are dropping off, dropping away,
suffering, dying young, going

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:24.370 align:middle line:84%
crazy at the effect where you're
not managing those energies,

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:26.080 align:middle line:84%
where you're not
able to take them in,

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:28.360 align:middle line:84%
in a stabilizing and
healthful manner,

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:29.620 align:middle line:90%
because it's not stable.

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:30.670 align:middle line:90%
None of this is stable.

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
how, philosophically,

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:34.960 align:middle line:90%
do you look at this?

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And would you share how
we might all look at it?

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Because so many
can't hang with it.

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:42.340 align:middle line:90%
And others are going to thrive.

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:44.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's just the way it is.

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's the only part
of evolution that I truly agree

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:51.010 align:middle line:84%
with is what's happening is some
people are able to handle this

00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:53.620 align:middle line:84%
massive amount of
information and data input,

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:54.970 align:middle line:90%
and some people aren't.

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And nature is weeding out the
weaker ones or the ones that

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:00.580 align:middle line:84%
haven't been able to
grasp it or hold on to it

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:01.940 align:middle line:90%
and are struggling with it.

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.273 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that make it
through are the stronger ones.

00:50:04.273 --> 00:50:08.223 align:middle line:84%
It's just like mating animals
or genetically modifying plants

00:50:08.223 --> 00:50:09.640 align:middle line:84%
to be a stronger
tree or whatever.

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.580 align:middle line:90%
It's part of nature.

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And stronger people are
making it to the top.

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Then they're going to have
babies, and they'll become--

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:19.410 align:middle line:84%
so it's almost like
a new human species

00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:21.810 align:middle line:90%
coming out of a human species.

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I was shown once
upon a time, a few years ago

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:27.712 align:middle line:84%
that in this new human
species that's arriving,

00:50:27.712 --> 00:50:29.670 align:middle line:84%
you were talking about
food a little while ago.

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at
cosmic influences.

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And one of the simple
things I was shown

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:37.320 align:middle line:84%
is that part of the reason
our digestive systems are

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:40.530 align:middle line:84%
atrophying is because we're
moving out of the sources,

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:44.670 align:middle line:84%
eating these kind of dense
foods, low frequency foods,

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:47.910 align:middle line:84%
into a vehicle that's much more
efficient, that the body is

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:51.040 align:middle line:84%
going to be living more
on chlorophyll type of--

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.220 align:middle line:90%
a liquid diet in the future.

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So I say have all the
croissants now you can.

00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: That's right.

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they're going away.

00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:57.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I talk a
lot about the fact

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:01.620 align:middle line:84%
that space-faring
civilizations probably

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:03.393 align:middle line:84%
moved towards more of
a plant-based diet.

00:51:03.393 --> 00:51:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what I saw.

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And liquid and
green in particular.

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It just makes sense.

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where you're
getting this interaction

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.830 align:middle line:84%
with the cosmos and the sun
and the Earth and the herbs

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:11.630 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:12.840 align:middle line:90%
It's just logical.

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:14.610 align:middle line:90%
It's just the logical next step.

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:17.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even if you look at it
from a technology standpoint,

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:20.310 align:middle line:84%
you can't afford-- in space,
energy is, like, prime.

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:22.260 align:middle line:84%
You can't divert energy
to storing and keeping

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:23.060 align:middle line:90%
meat frozen.

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:23.760 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: You can't do it.

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:25.807 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make
any logical sense.

00:51:25.807 --> 00:51:29.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even us not being out
there right now in the stars,

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:31.560 align:middle line:84%
we just know that that
doesn't make any sense.

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:33.820 align:middle line:84%
On the Apollo 11, they didn't
have a meat locker, OK?

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:35.420 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:37.020 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, in
Michio Kaku's world,

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.450 align:middle line:84%
you have these levels of
civilization type one, type

00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:41.290 align:middle line:90%
two, type three, and so forth.

00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:44.332 align:middle line:84%
And so I think he said,
we're, like, type half.

00:51:44.332 --> 00:51:45.132 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Zero.

00:51:45.132 --> 00:51:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Zero.

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:47.940 align:middle line:90%
Moving into one.

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is
your view on that?

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:52.907 align:middle line:84%
Because you're part of this,
and your kids are part of it.

00:51:52.907 --> 00:51:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us are part of
this explosion of knowledge

00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and trying to hang with it and
move forward and thrive in it.

00:51:59.110 --> 00:51:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, it's
really an exciting time,

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:02.817 align:middle line:90%
like I was say before.

00:52:02.817 --> 00:52:05.557 align:middle line:84%
And analyzing Nikolai
Kardashev's work

00:52:05.557 --> 00:52:07.140 align:middle line:84%
in terms of-- he was
an astrophysicist

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:09.320 align:middle line:84%
and a scientist from
Russia who came up

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.250 align:middle line:90%
with this Kardashev Scale.

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And right now we're kind of
like a type 0.5 civilization

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:18.000 align:middle line:84%
where we're just now starting
to realize, oh, we can't just

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.500 align:middle line:84%
take all the resources
out of the planet

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:20.610 align:middle line:90%
and never replenish them.

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:22.702 align:middle line:84%
We can't just destroy
everything around us.

00:52:22.702 --> 00:52:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, like, we
have the Amazon burning

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:26.970 align:middle line:84%
now so people can grow
cattle and things like that.

00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of us
are starting realize

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:29.810 align:middle line:84%
that we can't
continue on this path,

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:31.305 align:middle line:90%
that something has to change.

00:52:31.305 --> 00:52:33.180 align:middle line:84%
So we're at that point
where we're realizing,

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:35.070 align:middle line:84%
we're waking up, we're going,
uh-oh, this ain't right.

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:36.690 align:middle line:84%
We've got to figure
something out here.

00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And eventually there will
be enough conscious souls

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:40.897 align:middle line:84%
on the planet that will be
collectively able to stop

00:52:40.897 --> 00:52:42.450 align:middle line:90%
and halt what's going on.

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:45.127 align:middle line:84%
A type one civilization is more
of a planetary civilization,

00:52:45.127 --> 00:52:46.710 align:middle line:84%
which is where we're
moving into where

00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:49.140 align:middle line:84%
we begin to harness the power
and the energy of the planet.

00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:51.030 align:middle line:84%
We live in resonance,
human resonant frequency

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.830 align:middle line:90%
with the planet.

00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:53.430 align:middle line:90%
We're a green society.

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:55.980 align:middle line:84%
We're not destroying and
just taking all the resources

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:56.670 align:middle line:90%
and destroying the planet.

00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:58.130 align:middle line:84%
We're living in complete
resonance with it.

00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:00.270 align:middle line:84%
We've found a way to tap
into different energies that

00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:01.312 align:middle line:90%
don't destroy the planet.

00:53:01.312 --> 00:53:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And this planet can
house 20 billion people

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:04.620 align:middle line:90%
without even a problem.

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have made this
argument so many times.

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And there was a woman who showed
me this one particular graph

00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:12.430 align:middle line:84%
that if you were living
in harmony with nature,

00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:14.610 align:middle line:84%
you could essentially
put all the people

00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:17.100 align:middle line:84%
on a little hectare of
land in the state of Texas,

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:17.910 align:middle line:90%
and you'd be OK.

00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, there's
plenty of room for people

00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:23.400 align:middle line:84%
if we were intelligent and
living in companionship

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.370 align:middle line:90%
with our earth.

00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And it takes the fact
of us consciously

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:28.350 align:middle line:90%
making the decision to do it.

00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:29.185 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:53:29.185 --> 00:53:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.020 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:33.070 align:middle line:90%
And now you're doing your part.

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:35.520 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about your
space agency a little bit.

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:36.660 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, people--

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:39.150 align:middle line:84%
I think you've already been
on a number of shows at Gaia.

00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So people can check
out Billy Carson

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:42.960 align:middle line:84%
on a search in the Gaia bar and
find you all over the place.

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh yeah.

00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let's talk about
your company, the space agency,

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.695 align:middle line:84%
what you're doing, because
you're really starting to look

00:53:48.695 --> 00:53:51.113 align:middle line:90%
at bringing forward for real--

00:53:51.113 --> 00:53:53.280 align:middle line:84%
we've all heard about the
prototypes for the last 30

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.080 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.820 align:middle line:84%
But bringing forward
real technologies

00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:58.960 align:middle line:90%
such as perpetual motion.

00:53:58.960 --> 00:53:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.383 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what you're up to.

00:54:01.383 --> 00:54:02.258 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, sure.

00:54:02.258 --> 00:54:04.590 align:middle line:84%
In 2014, I filed for a company
called First Class Space

00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Agency in the state of Florida.

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Initially my thought was how can
I directly affect human beings

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:14.730 align:middle line:84%
on this planet and help
them by utilizing moneys

00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:16.350 align:middle line:84%
from what I thought
was going to be

00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:18.930 align:middle line:84%
the future of private space,
which ended up being that.

00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:21.000 align:middle line:90%
So I saw that vision again.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Before Elon Musk?

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Around that time.

00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:24.840 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to get
it going, you know.

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:25.980 align:middle line:90%
I think he was running--

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:28.010 align:middle line:84%
just getting out of PayPal
at that time or still getting

00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:28.410 align:middle line:90%
started.

00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:29.910 align:middle line:84%
But I was like, you
know, I've gotta

00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:32.640 align:middle line:84%
find a way to tap into this,
and I can utilize that revenue

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:35.170 align:middle line:84%
to create technologies for
space but that also will benefit

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:37.170 align:middle line:84%
mankind, because the
technologies I have learned

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:39.450 align:middle line:84%
through my research
over the many years

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:41.880 align:middle line:84%
that they always trickle
back down to humanity.

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Some of it.

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Not all of it.

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:45.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, they keep tucked
away some of the good stuff.

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:48.360 align:middle line:84%
But you know, cell phones
were originally military.

00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.790 align:middle line:84%
A lot of technologies that
we've done and medicines we've

00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:53.340 align:middle line:84%
developed in space, and then
they come back here to Earth.

00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So I said, if I can
develop generators

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.360 align:middle line:84%
that can go to third
world countries

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.987 align:middle line:84%
like India and Nigeria
and other places

00:54:59.987 --> 00:55:02.070 align:middle line:84%
and give them the capability
of having electricity

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:03.340 align:middle line:90%
and power, that would be great.

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:04.757 align:middle line:84%
And plus it can
be used for space,

00:55:04.757 --> 00:55:07.335 align:middle line:84%
and I can get money and
funding for that very easily.

00:55:07.335 --> 00:55:08.210 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I did.

00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:09.793 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize how
hard it was going

00:55:09.793 --> 00:55:12.650 align:middle line:84%
to be to get the approval from
the attorneys and the NATO

00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:13.690 align:middle line:90%
and ESA.

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It a lot
of money and a lot

00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:16.400 align:middle line:84%
of years, but I finally
got it all done.

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.433 align:middle line:90%
I'm approved with NATO.

00:55:17.433 --> 00:55:19.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm registered with the European
Space Agency as a vendor.

00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:21.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm registered with
NASA as a vendor.

00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:23.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm registered with the
Pentagon and approved.

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I can submit proposals
and get contracts.

00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's persistence.

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: A lot.

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:28.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:31.705 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
hydrogen. Because years ago

00:55:31.705 --> 00:55:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was doing
an environmental report

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:35.630 align:middle line:84%
in the early '90s,
and I was reporting

00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:39.260 align:middle line:84%
on I think it was a BMW
conversion to hydrogen,

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:40.590 align:middle line:90%
and it was functioning.

00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:41.390 align:middle line:90%
Squashed.

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.780 align:middle line:90%
Went away.

00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Never heard anything
about it again.

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They have a few
of those that have come out.

00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: But now
is really the time.

00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is starting to get
away from the fossil fuels

00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and realizing we've got to make
some changes on this planet.

00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:51.720 align:middle line:90%
So now is really the time.

00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:53.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm coming at the
right time with this.

00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're working with hydrogen
generators, which are not new.

00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, but have
you perfected it somehow?

00:55:58.580 --> 00:55:59.603 align:middle line:90%
Made it more stable?

00:55:59.603 --> 00:56:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, there's
a very unique process.

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.320 align:middle line:90%
Very unstable.

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Not too wasteful, but
not as much power output.

00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:07.270 align:middle line:84%
But there's a very
specific technique,

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:08.920 align:middle line:84%
which I can't go into,
obviously, yet because it's

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.003 align:middle line:90%
really kind of top secret.

00:56:10.003 --> 00:56:11.600 align:middle line:84%
But a form of
electrolysis that we're

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.450 align:middle line:84%
using with a different
type of filter that

00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:16.490 align:middle line:84%
allows us to get the
hydrogen atom separated

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:18.487 align:middle line:84%
from the oxygen a
lot more efficiently

00:56:18.487 --> 00:56:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and pushed over to another
chamber for combustion.

00:56:20.570 --> 00:56:22.220 align:middle line:90%
And the only emission is steam.

00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:23.372 align:middle line:90%
So it's completely green.

00:56:23.372 --> 00:56:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
is something that

00:56:24.830 --> 00:56:27.710 align:middle line:84%
could be applied even down to
the automotive industry, not

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:28.730 align:middle line:90%
just the space industry.

00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Not just the space.

00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Anywhere.

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that's
kind of been the holy grail,

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.720 align:middle line:90%
people waiting for hydrogen.

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:33.530 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you don't
have to plug into anything.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in a
spaceship, you know,

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:38.030 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these
asteroids are loaded

00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:40.110 align:middle line:90%
with billions of tons of water.

00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you're out in
deep space and you

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:44.300 align:middle line:84%
want fresh water
and also power, you

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.700 align:middle line:84%
can just tap into an existing
asteroid that's already

00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:48.770 align:middle line:84%
out there with water,
convert that into power,

00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:51.260 align:middle line:90%
and have water as well.

00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're out of time,
and we've just barely wound up.

00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:58.172 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how much fun
it has been getting to know you,

00:56:58.172 --> 00:57:00.380 align:middle line:84%
you know, and what you've
been up to and how you feel

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and the whole notion that you're
excited about this crazy period

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:04.340 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:05.600 align:middle line:90%
I am too.

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:07.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't see our future as dim.

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.750 align:middle line:90%
I see it as brightening.

00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
know, we might have

00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:11.330 align:middle line:90%
some wobbles to pass through.

00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts
before we sign off?

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:14.180 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: I just
want to tell people

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:16.140 align:middle line:10%
that, you know, no matter what
you're going through in life,

00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:17.090 align:middle line:10%
you can always excel.

00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:18.400 align:middle line:10%
You can always persevere.

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.150 align:middle line:10%
You just have to make
a conscious decision

00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:23.990 align:middle line:10%
to do it, put action behind
that, and focus on it,

00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:26.120 align:middle line:10%
meditate on it, think
about it, speak it.

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Speak it into existence.

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:29.600 align:middle line:90%
And it will happen for you.

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:31.617 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You are the
poster man for that.

00:57:31.617 --> 00:57:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Thank you.

00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank
you so much, Billy.

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.060 align:middle line:90%
Phew.

00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:35.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:38.270 align:middle line:10%
So you can go to Billy's site,
4bidden knowledge-- that's

00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:39.650 align:middle line:10%
