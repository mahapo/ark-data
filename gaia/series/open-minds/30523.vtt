00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: We've
all heard of the notion

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.460 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth and
its inhabitants

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.830 align:middle line:84%
are transitioning into a new
higher dimensional reality.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Many thought that 2012
was going to catapult us

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.580 align:middle line:90%
into that new dimension.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:90%
In truth, it's a process.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:84%
One that can be expedited by
our own knowledge, practices,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.720 align:middle line:90%
and choices.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:10%
No one explains this
transition more clearly

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.150 align:middle line:10%
than Jim Self, founder
of Mastering Alchemy.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.650 align:middle line:10%
He teaches the
hallmarks of what it

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:10%
is to be living in
the third dimension,

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.345 align:middle line:10%
and what it is to be
transitioning into the fifth.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.600 align:middle line:10%
More so, how we can
spend more time there.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Jim is with us today.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.620 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Jim.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.703 align:middle line:84%
It's been about a year
since we last sat together,

00:00:52.703 --> 00:00:53.912 align:middle line:90%
and your book is finally out.

00:00:53.912 --> 00:00:55.286 align:middle line:84%
And I love the
title, What Do You

00:00:55.286 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Mean The Third
Dimension Is Going Away.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
kind of mind popper

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.584 align:middle line:90%
when people think about it.

00:01:00.584 --> 00:01:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>JIM SELF: Yes.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.282 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we have so
many things to discuss here.

00:01:04.282 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:84%
But before we get into
the whole notion of what

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.370 align:middle line:84%
happened to the third dimension,
we need to find out about you.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Because whoever has not heard
my previous archived interview

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.849 align:middle line:84%
with you doesn't know why
you know what you know.

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:18.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you could just
tell us a little

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
bit about your childhood
and the awakeness

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.350 align:middle line:84%
that you were able to maintain
throughout your lifetime.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.570 align:middle line:10%
>>SELF: You know, when a
person comes into a body,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.720 align:middle line:10%
they are fully conscious.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.410 align:middle line:10%
What happens is they don't have
the mechanisms to demonstrate

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.850 align:middle line:10%
that full consciousness
as a little baby.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:10%
That soft spot on
the top of your head

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.090 align:middle line:10%
is that place where you're
connected and wide open

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.670 align:middle line:10%
until it starts to close down.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Everybody comes in
actually very fully loaded.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.320 align:middle line:84%
You come in with
your clairvoyance.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:84%
You come in with all of
these different skills

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.520 align:middle line:84%
that we all strive
for right now,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:84%
because we've lost them
over periods of time.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.810 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
happens is, as a little kid,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.310 align:middle line:84%
you start to listen to the mom,
dad, teacher, minister of life

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and they say stop playing
at that little table

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.669 align:middle line:84%
with those eight empty chairs
and your imaginary friends.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the imaginary
friends, the angels and all

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.250 align:middle line:84%
of the others that you're
intimately connected with,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
and you look at mom,
dad, teacher, minister

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.540 align:middle line:90%
and you make a choice.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And you basically
become a human being

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.580 align:middle line:90%
in a body playing out the game.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.260 align:middle line:90%
We all have that experience.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.800 align:middle line:84%
In my reality, I
didn't shut that down.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, many people
don't shut that down.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.930 align:middle line:84%
They have various aspects
of that as they grow up.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.470 align:middle line:84%
But in my case, I
just kept believing

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.440 align:middle line:84%
what I believed and
knew what I knew.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd go through school
with all of these awarenesses

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.130 align:middle line:84%
and clairvoyance and the ability
to heal people and do things,

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and it was a natural
experience for me.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.510 align:middle line:84%
As I got into high
school, that started

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.505 align:middle line:84%
to be something
strange, or it started

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:54.390 align:middle line:84%
to be something of not
interest to anybody else.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.025 align:middle line:84%
So I effectively just
stopped talking about it

00:02:57.025 --> 00:02:59.880 align:middle line:84%
or paying attention to it,
but I thought it was natural.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And many people have
those experiences,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:84%
but what happens
to them is, they

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle line:90%
begin to think it's strange.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.222 align:middle line:84%
And then they begin to think
something's wrong with them.

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't this also a
reflection of people around you

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.410 align:middle line:84%
where others say, hey,
you're weirdo or whatever?

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Of course.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so,
you don't want to be

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.857 align:middle line:90%
disconnected from your peers.

00:03:17.857 --> 00:03:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Right.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.410 align:middle line:90%
But I was fortunate.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.240 align:middle line:90%
I played football.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:90%
I was a gymnast.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.250 align:middle line:90%
I was a diver in college.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:90%
I did all the things.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.780 align:middle line:84%
I was popular, in terms
of the social structure.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:90%
But I just knew things.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And nobody else
seemed to ask how

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.180 align:middle line:84%
do you know those things,
which was always amazing to me.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And then going through
my 20s and 30s, when

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.230 align:middle line:84%
I got to about 30, all of a
sudden a lot of the pieces

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.640 align:middle line:90%
started to come together.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:84%
But one of the pieces
that makes what

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I do different than a
lot of other people do,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.970 align:middle line:84%
is when I go to
sleep at night, I

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.790 align:middle line:84%
go to sleep just more or
less like you go to sleep.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:90%
You put your head down.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Most of the times you're
asleep before you even

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.150 align:middle line:84%
take the next
couple of breathes.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.200 align:middle line:90%
And then you leave the body.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you leave
the body, you go home.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Every single night
everybody goes home.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's coming back
from being at home.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:84%
It's as if you
were in an airplane

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.650 align:middle line:84%
and you're at 30,000
feet, and you're

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:84%
in this very beautiful
pristine vibration.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:84%
And then you start to
come down through a storm

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:90%
and you get a little jolted.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.970 align:middle line:84%
But by the time you
come back to the body,

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.980 align:middle line:90%
you forget all of that.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.800 align:middle line:90%
You step back into the body.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
happens when I go to sleep

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:84%
is I go to sleep like
you, but when I come back,

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.217 align:middle line:90%
I don't forget.

00:04:34.217 --> 00:04:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.837 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's the dream of
dreamers, is to not forget.

00:04:40.837 --> 00:04:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: It is.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in the
process of that alone,

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:84%
where as you go
down, stepping down

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.910 align:middle line:84%
through those frequencies,
which become increasingly

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.200 align:middle line:84%
dense and harsh, the
mind-- the conscious mind

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:84%
seems to want to dress-up
these experiences

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.670 align:middle line:84%
we've had with
something more familiar.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.470 align:middle line:90%
It becomes mundane.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, familiar
is the right word.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:84%
See, it's a very
interesting thing.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:84%
When you go to sleep at night,
it's a fascinating process.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Those acupuncture points that
we know of in the meridian

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:84%
systems, those are little
vortexes that if you

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.020 align:middle line:84%
turn them one way,
they tighten down.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.080 align:middle line:84%
If you turn them another way,
acupuncture, they loosen up.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.270 align:middle line:84%
But those are the docking
points between the physical body

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and the astral, etheric,
mental, emotional, bodies.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And so when you go to sleep, you
simply say, I'm going to sleep

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.500 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to loosen
all those magnetic fields,

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:90%
and you leave.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.440 align:middle line:84%
But when you leave, most
people don't clear their space.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.930 align:middle line:90%
They simply say, I'm wiped out.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:38.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm tired.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm exhausted.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go to sleep
now, and they lay down.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Then they leave and they go
through those bumpinesses,

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.130 align:middle line:84%
astral plane, and
then they go home.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle line:90%
And home is a spectacular place.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.087 align:middle line:84%
And home doesn't work in
words and language either,

00:05:52.087 --> 00:05:53.420 align:middle line:90%
we'll talk about it in a minute.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.290 align:middle line:84%
But when you come
back to the body,

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.210 align:middle line:84%
even if you are
in a great space,

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.920 align:middle line:84%
the minute you dock,
the minute you anchor

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:84%
into those acupuncture
points, you effectively

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:84%
turn on yesterday
all over again.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.060 align:middle line:84%
So you didn't clear
the space, and this

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.670 align:middle line:84%
is what many people
do, they just

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.010 align:middle line:84%
simply step right back
into their noise, the anger

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:84%
the emotions of the day before
and go, I'm going to work now,

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:84%
and repeat the
pattern over and over.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The program starts.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:18.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Exactly.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.470 align:middle line:84%
So really, the structure of
the density, the emotions,

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.150 align:middle line:84%
the anger, the frustrations,
the belief system

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:84%
is such that when you bring
this very fine field into it,

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.680 align:middle line:84%
it gets overwhelmed
by the noise.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.638 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:35.638 --> 00:06:37.096 align:middle line:84%
Just a moment ago,
you said you are

00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:39.010 align:middle line:84%
going to explain this
a little bit further,

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.012 align:middle line:84%
some aspect of the dreaming
part in separation and return

00:06:42.012 --> 00:06:43.750 align:middle line:90%
to the body.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.714 align:middle line:84%
That there are no
words for home.

00:06:45.714 --> 00:06:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Yeah, two
pieces of that though.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.930 align:middle line:84%
What happens is everybody
wants this experience.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's about to
start to have this experience

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.740 align:middle line:84%
because this aspect
of the third dimension

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.130 align:middle line:84%
is now gone, we'll talk
about again in a minute,

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.250 align:middle line:84%
is such that a lot of the glue
and the magnetic fields that

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.350 align:middle line:84%
hold you in "I'm not OK"
are no longer in place.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.270 align:middle line:84%
So everybody wants
this experience,

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:84%
and everybody is in process of
moving towards this experience.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.200 align:middle line:84%
But as we'll talk
about in a few minutes,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.080 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be a little bit
of a choppy ride between here

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.010 align:middle line:90%
and there in this transition.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.500 align:middle line:84%
But to answer the question,
one of the things that happens

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:34.520 align:middle line:84%
is language is a very limiting
concept of consciousness.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.255 align:middle line:90%
Very, very limiting.

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's so structured that
you cannot explain higher

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.350 align:middle line:84%
dimensional frequencies and
vibrations and even colors,

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.320 align:middle line:84%
because there's far more
colors than the seven we know.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.440 align:middle line:84%
What happens is,
the language is so

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.780 align:middle line:84%
limiting that we wind up
not having good reference

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.150 align:middle line:84%
points to what we are
very familiar with when

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.460 align:middle line:84%
we try to bring it
back into the body.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.790 align:middle line:84%
So a big piece of what is
in the process of happening

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:06.120 align:middle line:84%
is you can't bring this
level into the body,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.270 align:middle line:84%
but you can very much
bring the new body

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.100 align:middle line:90%
into the spiritual level.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very different
concept for most people.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I think we need
to dive into the notion

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.280 align:middle line:84%
of the dimensions,
and we need to dive

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.238 align:middle line:84%
into the notion of the
title of your book, What

00:08:21.238 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Do You Mean The Third
Dimension Is Going Away.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yeah.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And just from my own
point of view, many years ago,

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.429 align:middle line:84%
over the last 30 years,
I've had the opportunity

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:84%
of speaking with some very
refined types of beings that

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:84%
were saying all along,
this has already begun.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, 10 years ago, they
said this is nearly complete.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.620 align:middle line:84%
The movement into the
fourth dimensional field

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.530 align:middle line:90%
is nearly complete already.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And you say in your book
a very similar thing,

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.072 align:middle line:84%
that this transition has
been going on for 60 years.

00:08:53.072 --> 00:08:54.530 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't an
overnight thing that

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:84%
was going to happen and
pop us into a new reality.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what this thing is

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.510 align:middle line:84%
and what it means to
move from one dimension

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.080 align:middle line:84%
to another, before we even go
into the unique characteristics

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.300 align:middle line:84%
psychologically, emotionally
of the third dimension.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: So let's
go back 60 years.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And I say 60 years
because this transition

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.100 align:middle line:90%
has been seen for a long time.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.120 align:middle line:84%
The higher levels
of consciousness

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:84%
have been moving
this to this level.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And whether we could
do this or not--

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and I say we because in
that space where I go home

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.820 align:middle line:84%
every night, the archangels,
the ascended masters, Yeshua,

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.380 align:middle line:84%
all these great
beings are there.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.700 align:middle line:90%
Every night they're there.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.350 align:middle line:90%
And every night, you're there.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:35.660 align:middle line:90%
You sit at the same table.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Every one of the yous in the
world sit at that same table.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So this has been an
evolutionary process

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.220 align:middle line:90%
for some period of time.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:46.500 align:middle line:84%
At the end of World
War II in the '44, '45,

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.170 align:middle line:84%
'46 period of time, a
new grouping of beings

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.760 align:middle line:90%
came into the planet.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And those beings are
now in their 50s and 60s

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.930 align:middle line:84%
and starting into their 70s,
but they carried with them

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:02.560 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity
that was hoped for.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.390 align:middle line:84%
We went through the '60s
and major things happened

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s, where all of
those free love and all

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.000 align:middle line:84%
of the different movements
that we had going on:

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.020 align:middle line:84%
the gay movement and
the women's movement

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and the shifts in anti-war
movements, bowel movements.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.309 align:middle line:84%
We had all kinds of movements
in that period of time.

00:10:22.309 --> 00:10:24.100 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was,
an interesting thing

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.530 align:middle line:84%
is all of that came
to the surface,

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.240 align:middle line:84%
there was lots of excitement
and then it kind of died down.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And in the '70s and
the '80s, it went away.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And you said where
did that all go?

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.730 align:middle line:90%
It didn't go away.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And then in '87 with the
harmonic convergence coming in,

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.860 align:middle line:90%
an enormous experiment.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.910 align:middle line:90%
That came in and it worked.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.840 align:middle line:84%
It did what it was
supposed to be doing.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So now here we are
moving basically

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.790 align:middle line:84%
20 years later into that
harmonic experience,

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.040 align:middle line:90%
and much is going on.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So one of the very
important pieces of this

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.990 align:middle line:84%
is this aspect of
understanding these vibrations

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and these frequencies, and
understanding who you are.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And you scientifically,
you're defined as oxygen,

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.780 align:middle line:90%
hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But what's beginning to
happen is that carbon element

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.550 align:middle line:84%
in this new grouping period
of time, the new kids that

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:20.850 align:middle line:84%
are coming in, all over
the Earth they're beginning

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:25.720 align:middle line:84%
to be known in scientific terms
as oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen,

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.630 align:middle line:90%
and silica.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And so that carbon
element is changing,

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and everybody is
now in the process

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.890 align:middle line:84%
of moving into this
carbon-shifting in the element.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:39.370 align:middle line:90%
But what was hoped for was 2012.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:84%
This whole aspect
of moving into 2012,

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's been called
the Mayan Calendar,

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.620 align:middle line:84%
it was the label
that most of us have

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.770 align:middle line:84%
been playing with for
the last number of years.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's focusing on the
ending times or the beginning

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:84%
times and the relationship
of the Mayan Calendar.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot to that
Mayan Calendar in a larger

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.190 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:01.670 align:middle line:84%
But in a smaller perspective,
what had to occur--

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.885 align:middle line:84%
or not smaller at
all-- what had to occur

00:12:03.885 --> 00:12:07.920 align:middle line:84%
is we had to get to a
place where humanity

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.923 align:middle line:84%
was in the process of being
willing to accept this shift.

00:12:11.923 --> 00:12:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, It's interesting
because when

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I spend lots of the time with
the archangels consciously

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:22.180 align:middle line:84%
in this moment and all of my
moments, they say very clearly,

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:84%
we can tell you all
the probabilities.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.440 align:middle line:84%
We can tell you
the possibilities.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.940 align:middle line:84%
We can even tell you the ones
that you've narrowed in on

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and are most likely
going to occur.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:36.120 align:middle line:84%
We won't tell you those things,
but the reason we won't is

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.880 align:middle line:84%
because it's a human experience,
and you have the body.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.456 align:middle line:84%
You're the ones
who have to choose.

00:12:42.456 --> 00:12:44.330 align:middle line:84%
You're the ones who have
to make this happen.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Choice.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Choice.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is the word.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:46.736 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Exactly.

00:12:46.736 --> 00:12:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about that
in a big manner in a moment.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.360 align:middle line:90%
So you have to make this happen.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.290 align:middle line:84%
But over that period of time
since the harmonic convergence,

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.070 align:middle line:90%
there's been a huge awakening.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:59.337 align:middle line:84%
And people pray and people
meditate and people get quiet

00:12:59.337 --> 00:13:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and people begin to
focus, and there's

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.710 align:middle line:84%
a clear wanting of
something different.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Now this is where it all
begins to get very interesting,

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.080 align:middle line:84%
this wanting of
something different.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: But what
has occurred is--

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.350 align:middle line:84%
let me define the
dimensions, and I

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.960 align:middle line:84%
think that will be a
helpful way of doing it.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.400 align:middle line:90%
Dimensions are not physical.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So this table, the
chair that we're

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
sitting in, the tree outside,
the Earth, that's form.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And form is physical,
but it's not a dimension.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.890 align:middle line:84%
What a dimension is, is
a state of consciousness

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:37.160 align:middle line:84%
that has many aspects of
choices, opportunities,

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.200 align:middle line:84%
energetic constructions
that allow

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:90%
you to create an experience.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.350 align:middle line:90%
It's just like grades in school.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:45.020 align:middle line:84%
You learn something
in fifth grade,

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.519 align:middle line:84%
and you go to sixth grade, and
then you go to seventh grade,

00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and you mature
through this process.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:56.200 align:middle line:84%
The third dimension is something
that is very fixed, very

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.540 align:middle line:90%
rigid, it is conditional.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:02.120 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing unconditional
in the third dimension at all.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:03.095 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk--

00:14:03.095 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Love.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.320 align:middle line:90%
Including love?

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Unconditional
love does not

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.640 align:middle line:84%
exist in the third dimension
and I'll explain why.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So now you kind of got to
follow the progression here,

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:13.920 align:middle line:84%
because there's a bunch
of pieces to this.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.030 align:middle line:90%
So the third dimension, rigid.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:19.510 align:middle line:84%
It deals in words
like always and never.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.280 align:middle line:84%
There's no flexibility
in always and never.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.300 align:middle line:90%
She's always going to be bad.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.730 align:middle line:84%
He's never going
to be different.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is you stay
in a place that's very fixed,

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and you continue to
repeat it over and over.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Third dimension has
a time element in it

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:84%
that most people think
is fixed, absolute,

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.980 align:middle line:84%
that past, present
future and then you die.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it is,
period, end of discussion.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:48.680 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, time
is an application.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.810 align:middle line:84%
It is not a fixed experience,
as we'll talk about in a second.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.650 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that happens is

00:14:55.650 --> 00:15:00.240 align:middle line:84%
when you constantly look at
time as a fixed past, present,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.990 align:middle line:84%
future, and you really
think about your experience

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.320 align:middle line:84%
or you watch other
people's experience,

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:84%
the majority of your
experience in third dimension

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:90%
is in the past.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.570 align:middle line:84%
I hope this thing doesn't
happen to me again,

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:84%
or they told me if I would,
then therefore, I will.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And so in the third
dimension, huge percentage

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:84%
of your experience is based
on the past and the future.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.805 align:middle line:84%
There's a little
sliver of present time

00:15:31.805 --> 00:15:33.390 align:middle line:84%
where we're talking
right now, we're

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.260 align:middle line:90%
very much in present time.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.720 align:middle line:84%
But in third dimension
present time,

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.942 align:middle line:90%
it's reactionary present time.

00:15:39.942 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh my God, this
wasn't supposed to happen.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.790 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want this to happen.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.620 align:middle line:84%
You're in present
time, but you're

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.560 align:middle line:84%
in a reactionary
state of present time.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens
is, you're living

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:84%
in that third, fourth
dimensional space

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.640 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So here's where,
if you understand

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.050 align:middle line:84%
what I just said
and you understand

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.630 align:middle line:84%
the next piece of this,
then the transition

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:07.200 align:middle line:84%
begins to be more
filled with ease.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.830 align:middle line:84%
So fourth dimension has
a time element, too.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.560 align:middle line:90%
It has present time.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the same present time
we're sitting in, in a way,

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:15.760 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.480 align:middle line:84%
In present time,
you have choice.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.340 align:middle line:84%
In reaction, you
don't have choice.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So in present time,
you have a choice.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm right here, I
have an experience

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.790 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't want to have
happen, but I can look at it

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and say, well,
this is what I can

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.800 align:middle line:90%
do about it versus the reaction.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Also in fourth
dimension, there's

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.480 align:middle line:84%
an interesting word
called paradox.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Paradox simply means what
was true a moment ago

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.370 align:middle line:90%
is not necessarily true now.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And what was false a moment ago
is no longer necessarily false.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's very
difficult for people

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.080 align:middle line:84%
coming from a
third-dimensional mindset

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:90%
to understand and operate with.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Almost impossible.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Because if I'm in
third dimension

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and I'm in always
and never, he's

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.200 align:middle line:90%
always going to be like this.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.510 align:middle line:90%
There's no flexibility.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:05.114 align:middle line:84%
There's no choice of
something different.

00:17:05.114 --> 00:17:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But the minute you step
into fourth dimension,

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and we do this all day long,
we move back and forth.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:14.310 align:middle line:84%
In fourth dimension,
unconditional exists.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:16.839 align:middle line:84%
But in third dimension,
it's only conditional.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:84%
It's reactionary,
conditional, fixed.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you can just allow
that as a point of entry

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.839 align:middle line:84%
into the discussion, and you
can allow the fourth dimension

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:31.990 align:middle line:84%
to be choice and present
time and paradox, so now,

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.730 align:middle line:84%
that person, he who is
never going to change,

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.380 align:middle line:84%
shows up on my doorstep
20 years later.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:41.150 align:middle line:84%
I can recall him
stealing from me,

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:44.620 align:middle line:84%
but I can say, hello,
nice to see you now.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.600 align:middle line:84%
I can keep it in
my awareness, but I

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.410 align:middle line:84%
don't have to judge
them by that filter.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:54.137 align:middle line:84%
That is an enormous shift from
third to fourth dimension.

00:17:54.137 --> 00:17:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yes.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at it in
terms of just pure physics

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the world
from an atomic point of view,

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.140 align:middle line:90%
it's flexing every moment.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And the manifestation
of it is simply

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:84%
a reflection of our
expectation, beliefs, thoughts,

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.740 align:middle line:84%
collective agreed upon
realities and so forth, that

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.700 align:middle line:90%
is the truth of life.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.241 align:middle line:84%
It is flexing and changing
by the nanosecond.

00:18:21.241 --> 00:18:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yes.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we, through our
lenses of beliefs as you say,

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.170 align:middle line:84%
you're saying the
future and the past

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.636 align:middle line:84%
and the inflexibility
of the always

00:18:29.636 --> 00:18:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and the never are
trapping ourselves

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.300 align:middle line:84%
so that we can't operate
in that fluid manner.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.300 align:middle line:84%
That's what we have been
you're saying, I think.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yes.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.060 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
third dimension.

00:18:39.435 --> 00:18:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Now let's add
another piece to this.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts are electrical
and emotions are magnetic.

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, it doesn't sound
like much right now,

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.580 align:middle line:84%
but it's an enormous
piece of this.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So what happens as we
grow up, that space I

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:57.710 align:middle line:84%
talked about right at the
beginning, that aligned

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:02.350 align:middle line:84%
spiritual space, that internal
compass system that we have,

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:84%
the ability to
determine-- let's use

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:90%
appropriate and inappropriate.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:12.620 align:middle line:84%
See, third dimension has worked
itself into this box also where

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.779 align:middle line:84%
it's right and wrong,
and good and bad,

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:15.820 align:middle line:90%
and should and shouldn't.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Very rigid structures
that, again,

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.530 align:middle line:90%
don't have those flexibilities.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's use appropriate
and inappropriate.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:28.480 align:middle line:84%
So if we could wave a magic wand
and I could simply say to you,

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.990 align:middle line:84%
let's remove the words good
and bad and right and wrong

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and should and shouldn't, took
them out of your vocabulary,

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:84%
never heard them, would
you be a different person?

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Definitely.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: OK.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.634 align:middle line:84%
So then, if I said
you, "Now, I'd

00:19:40.634 --> 00:19:43.410 align:middle line:84%
like you to go over there
and murder that person."

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And you'd go, "Well,
no, I can't do that."

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:46.340 align:middle line:90%
Well why?

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.090 align:middle line:84%
There's no good or
bad, no right or wrong,

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.230 align:middle line:90%
no should or shouldn't.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.364 align:middle line:84%
The answer is it doesn't
feel appropriate.

00:19:52.364 --> 00:19:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: It's not aligned
with this internal compass.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.720 align:middle line:84%
This internal compass,
that little kid

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.110 align:middle line:84%
that we all want to be again
that smiles and is innocent,

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:06.635 align:middle line:84%
that internal compass
never left you.

00:20:06.635 --> 00:20:09.510 align:middle line:90%
You left the internal compass.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Now this is where
it gets interesting,

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:15.160 align:middle line:84%
too, is as we grow
up and we begin

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.150 align:middle line:84%
to listen to the mom, dad,
teacher, minister of life,

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and they begin to say, well,
here, I know better than you.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:22.370 align:middle line:90%
Do it my way.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.340 align:middle line:84%
In this household we do
this, we go to this school.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:84%
We hang out with
these people, we

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.134 align:middle line:84%
don't hang out
with those people.

00:20:28.134 --> 00:20:29.620 align:middle line:84%
We go to this
church, and we don't

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.040 align:middle line:90%
go to that church over there.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And so the conditionality
of the third dimension

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.740 align:middle line:90%
becomes very apparent.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.320 align:middle line:84%
As we begin to do
that, what happens is

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.260 align:middle line:84%
the no's and the don'ts and the
should's and shouldn'ts begin

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.080 align:middle line:90%
to weigh on our decision-making.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to
say, well, OK, I'll

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.880 align:middle line:84%
do what you say mom,
dad, teacher, minister.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And let's be real clear, no bad
mom, dad, teacher, ministers.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.760 align:middle line:84%
They just were the
children of the parents

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.610 align:middle line:84%
that they were the
parents of also.

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
here, though, is you

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.591 align:middle line:84%
start to have this relationship
with everybody else outside

00:21:04.591 --> 00:21:05.090 align:middle line:90%
of you.

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Your external world begins to
be much more of your driver

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.099 align:middle line:90%
then your internal world.

00:21:10.099 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doesn't that
immediately, though,

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.728 align:middle line:84%
put us-- well, not immediately,
over time-- very seriously

00:21:14.728 --> 00:21:16.602 align:middle line:84%
put us totally out of
sync with our own truth

00:21:16.602 --> 00:21:17.644 align:middle line:90%
and reality, any reality.

00:21:17.644 --> 00:21:18.435 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Absolutely.

00:21:18.435 --> 00:21:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's an artificial
construct completely then.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:21.419 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yes.

00:21:21.419 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:84%
But aren't you in a
quandary at that point.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:27.770 align:middle line:84%
If I can't trust myself, or
they're saying this is right

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.910 align:middle line:84%
and I'm feeling this
is right-- and this

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:33.250 align:middle line:84%
is one of the places where
millions of people watching

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.110 align:middle line:84%
this show, very
sensitive people,

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:40.120 align:middle line:84%
hiders, because I
have had to withdraw.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so sensitive on a
kinesthetic feeling level that

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:48.140 align:middle line:84%
what I'm feeling all the time
is these good-bad, right-wrong,

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.360 align:middle line:90%
should-shouldn'ts.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also feeling this
aspect where somebody

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:55.064 align:middle line:84%
says to you, well,
you're not attractive.

00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:55.730 align:middle line:90%
You're not good.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:56.500 align:middle line:90%
You're not smart.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.550 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to succeed.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.008 align:middle line:84%
You're never going
to get it right.

00:21:59.008 --> 00:22:00.870 align:middle line:90%
Nobody likes you anyway.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And you go, whoa, what
do I do with this?

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.430 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
happens, and I say this a lot

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.290 align:middle line:84%
in the book and I say
in lots of lectures,

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.930 align:middle line:84%
we have become conditioned
to who we are not.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: And we
simply accept that.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody says you're
not attractive, you don't fit,

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:18.170 align:middle line:84%
you're not you're
never going to succeed,

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and why didn't you
get 100 on your test?

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:24.220 align:middle line:84%
You only got 99,
what's wrong with you?

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Somebody simply
says, here, would you

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.250 align:middle line:90%
accept my gift to you?

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.290 align:middle line:90%
And you go and you accept it.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:30.960 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with you?

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like putting on a pair of
shoes that are way too small

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:35.430 align:middle line:90%
or a coat that doesn't fit.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.480 align:middle line:90%
But then we walk around with it.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And somebody insults you
and you're walking around

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.866 align:middle line:84%
with this, and
you don't like it.

00:22:41.866 --> 00:22:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And you go to your
best friend and they

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:45.310 align:middle line:84%
say what's wrong with
you, what's going on?

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, somebody
said I had bad breath.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And your best friend looks at
you and goes, they're right.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:84%
But at that point,
what you do with that?

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:56.900 align:middle line:90%
You're not smart.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.150 align:middle line:90%
You're never going to succeed.

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.007 align:middle line:84%
Somebody says, what
do you do with that?

00:23:00.007 --> 00:23:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All those gifts.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: All those gifts.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is because we
depend on that external world,

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:09.630 align:middle line:90%
we simply go, OK, and accept it.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.970 align:middle line:84%
This is where the whole
game gets interesting,

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.940 align:middle line:84%
is after a few minutes
of walking around,

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.950 align:middle line:84%
a few days of walking
around, my best friend

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:17.750 align:middle line:84%
going you still
look kind of down.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:18.450 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Oh, nothing.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what to do with this.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.430 align:middle line:90%
I make a decision.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.340 align:middle line:84%
I simply take this
and put it over here

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.540 align:middle line:84%
into this little
box called denial.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.202 align:middle line:90%
And now it's gone, kind of.

00:23:32.202 --> 00:23:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's still there, but I
don't pay much attention to it.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Finally, I say look, I'll
make a deal with you.

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:40.570 align:middle line:84%
If you never come out
into the light of day

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:44.510 align:middle line:84%
again to cause me
to feel bad, I'll

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.860 align:middle line:84%
put you back here on
the shelf behind me

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:50.170 align:middle line:84%
in a place called
unconsciousness.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.020 align:middle line:90%
And then I'll be OK.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:55.050 align:middle line:10%
Well, what happens is
we take that I'm not OK,

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:10%
put it back there, and
then get about our life.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.990 align:middle line:10%
But you see people
all the time, as I do,

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:02.860 align:middle line:10%
and I say, hi, how
are you Regina?

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:06.510 align:middle line:90%
And Regina goes, oh, I'm OK.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:07.820 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean you're OK?

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, my father
died two years ago.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.110 align:middle line:90%
I lost my job.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:13.870 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
people walk around

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:84%
with all this not OK
defining themselves.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.854 align:middle line:84%
This is their third
dimensional conditional world.

00:24:19.854 --> 00:24:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
everybody watching

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.070 align:middle line:84%
this can relate to
every bit of that,

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.330 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know
a single person that

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:29.707 align:middle line:84%
hasn't bought in to some extent
to the programming around them.

00:24:29.707 --> 00:24:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And every now and then,
you see these people

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.550 align:middle line:84%
that have been given a
different kind of gift,

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:37.099 align:middle line:84%
an interesting kind of gift
of abandonment, so to speak--

00:24:37.099 --> 00:24:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Sure.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.848 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -from an early age.

00:24:38.848 --> 00:24:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Or perceived abandonment,
in which case

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.970 align:middle line:84%
you disconnect from
messages of others.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's a whole
different system.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:47.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it has its
harsh realities.

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Some of these people
are the most creative,

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed, in life
because they have been free

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.260 align:middle line:90%
of the programming.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's just kind
of throwing up in the air

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.290 align:middle line:84%
at it saying, I'm not going
to listen to anybody anymore.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:03.940 align:middle line:84%
There is some beauty
in having disconnected

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.550 align:middle line:90%
from the impressions of others.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Absolutely.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.645 align:middle line:84%
And what happens in
that case, and you

00:25:09.645 --> 00:25:11.464 align:middle line:90%
know I see this all the time.

00:25:11.464 --> 00:25:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's say a little four-year-old
girl, very capable,

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.630 align:middle line:84%
very talented, everything
she does turns out wonderful.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And people just go,
wow, you're so gifted.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And then one day a jealous
parent or a jealous kid

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.580 align:middle line:84%
sees her orange elephant that's
drawn outside of the lines

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.571 align:middle line:84%
and goes, don't you know
orange elephants don't exist

00:25:28.571 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:84%
and you're not supposed
to draw out of the line.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.610 align:middle line:84%
So, little girl's
walking along happy

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and she gets insulted or
her feelings get hurt,

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.350 align:middle line:84%
drops down into that
emotional mental space,

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.110 align:middle line:90%
and then does one of two things.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Walks around grumbling
for a couple days and then

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.740 align:middle line:90%
says, I'll show them.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Goes back up to
where she's been,

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.065 align:middle line:84%
brilliant, but walks
along constantly

00:25:51.065 --> 00:25:52.690 align:middle line:84%
looking over her
shoulder all her life.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:53.315 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:53.315 --> 00:25:56.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a corrupted kind of
progression from that point.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.465 align:middle line:84%
But the other is
losing all your will--

00:25:58.465 --> 00:25:59.673 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: That's the other one.

00:25:59.673 --> 00:26:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -and simply
succumbing to the other story.

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, now
you're saying because

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.610 align:middle line:84%
of the way the third dimensional
frequencies have been,

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:09.080 align:middle line:90%
that's a kind of support.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.800 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of medium that
we have been operating in--

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yes.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.841 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -for quite
a long time now.

00:26:14.841 --> 00:26:17.510 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't always that way, but
for a very long time, right?

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, the structure
we're talking about

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.030 align:middle line:84%
is, I pay attention
to my external world.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:23.980 align:middle line:84%
My external world
is created by lots

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.260 align:middle line:84%
of beliefs and
thoughts and emotions.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also walking around
with this baggage that

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.020 align:middle line:84%
says I'm not OK,
in simple terms.

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm supposed to
know myself from that space.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Those thoughts and emotions,
I'm not OK, I'm not OK,

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.080 align:middle line:84%
it's something where when you
start thinking I'm not OK,

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.990 align:middle line:84%
it's like taking a
thought, electrical wire,

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and wrapping it around a
block to steel, a magnet.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's like you create
a small magnetic field.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.420 align:middle line:84%
But if you think I'm not
OK, I'm not OK, I'm not OK,

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm not OK enough, you create
this very rigid belief system

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.310 align:middle line:84%
that drives you for
the rest of your life.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.835 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And this is real.

00:26:58.835 --> 00:26:59.918 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: This is very real.

00:26:59.918 --> 00:27:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is as concrete
as, well, theoretically,

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:06.670 align:middle line:84%
as this table theoretically
is in the world around us,

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:08.650 align:middle line:84%
in the energetic
world around us.

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And through the lens
of quantum physics.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So what you mean the third
dimension is going away?

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.292 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: What a great question.

00:27:14.292 --> 00:27:16.750 align:middle line:10%
See, one of the things that's
happening in this transition,

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:10%
into this evolution
that we're all part of,

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:10%
is this third dimension had
a very specific purpose--

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.640 align:middle line:10%
without going there for
the moment-- but it's time

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.520 align:middle line:10%
to step out of that.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Step out of that conditional,
rigid, reactionary right-wrong,

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.240 align:middle line:90%
good-bad state of being.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.960 align:middle line:10%
When you begin to step
into this fifth dimension,

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.790 align:middle line:10%
as a reference,
you begin to live

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:40.990 align:middle line:10%
an experience of co-creation,
respect, dignity, appreciation,

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:43.600 align:middle line:10%
gratitude,
cooperation, laughter.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.330 align:middle line:10%
That's the space that
everybody would love to be in.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:49.750 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
we have is a whole lot of I'm

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:52.040 align:middle line:90%
not OK in my backpack back here.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And so, I'm still in
that defensive mode.

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm still in that
reactionary mode.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:01.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm still in that responsive
and watching out for things.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:05.562 align:middle line:84%
In a fifth dimensional space,
words like trust and safety

00:28:05.562 --> 00:28:06.270 align:middle line:90%
don't even exist.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't exist.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:07.750 align:middle line:90%
You don't need them.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: There's nothing
that distrusting

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.760 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing not safe.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.910 align:middle line:84%
So how do you get to
that space is really

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:15.500 align:middle line:84%
the question that
we're looking at.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.210 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
is playing out right here

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:22.130 align:middle line:84%
is the third dimension
had to go away in order

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:24.660 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get
people out of that.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Now in this context,
the third dimension

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:30.200 align:middle line:84%
is like the glue
that holds together

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.050 align:middle line:84%
all of that stuff in my
backpack that says I'm not OK.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So the glue, these
magnetic fields

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:42.227 align:middle line:84%
that have been very rigid, very
restricted, as of 12/12/12,

00:28:42.227 --> 00:28:44.060 align:middle line:84%
when people say, well,
what really happened,

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm still here?

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.320 align:middle line:84%
December 21 came and went
and nothing really happened.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:50.980 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:52.432 align:middle line:90%
A lot really happened.

00:28:52.432 --> 00:28:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that happened

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.590 align:middle line:84%
is, as we stepped into
these higher dimensions,

00:28:56.590 --> 00:29:00.020 align:middle line:84%
these magnetic fields and
these vibrational frequencies

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.100 align:middle line:84%
of that third
dimension are gone.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Now it's an interesting
thing, one of the things

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:09.630 align:middle line:84%
that Metatron said as that event
occurred that we participated

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:13.040 align:middle line:84%
in helping that unfold, is
he said, from this moment

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.800 align:middle line:84%
on, on 12/12/12,
there will never

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:20.890 align:middle line:84%
be a child born into the third
dimensional reality again.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:26.180 align:middle line:84%
However, you human
beings have also just

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.280 align:middle line:84%
been stepped out of that
third dimensional space.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.760 align:middle line:84%
But you have habits,
and you have beliefs,

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and you have structure that
says it is still going on.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.610 align:middle line:84%
You still are looking at your
clock and thinking yesterday.

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:44.130 align:middle line:84%
You are still holding
onto the I'm not OKs

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:47.550 align:middle line:84%
as if they're still
very rigidly in place.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Much of that is no
longer in place,

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:53.711 align:middle line:84%
but your habit keeps
going and revisiting it

00:29:53.711 --> 00:29:55.585 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This has some
serious implications.

00:29:55.585 --> 00:29:56.850 align:middle line:10%
>>SELF: This is huge.

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:58.800 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Because what
I'm seeing in people

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.260 align:middle line:10%
right now is that
the way that they've

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:05.370 align:middle line:10%
been behaving in the past,
could kind of get through.

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:06.850 align:middle line:10%
You could muddle
through your days.

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:08.770 align:middle line:84%
You muddle through
with a lack of clarity

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing what you
want to do with your life,

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.730 align:middle line:84%
and reacting rather
than responding

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:17.240 align:middle line:90%
to every emotional situation.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Now when people are
doing that, it's

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:21.960 align:middle line:84%
like you're getting
instantly burned almost.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not working.

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: You mean present time?

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, in present time.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.546 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Because there
is no linear time.

00:30:26.546 --> 00:30:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Behaving and
thinking like in the--

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:28.795 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Exactly.

00:30:28.795 --> 00:30:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -third dimensional
sense and present time

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.000 align:middle line:90%
is so quick.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yes, it is.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's still a
little bit of a buffer.

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:38.460 align:middle line:84%
You can think a thought and
it doesn't quite happen.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.840 align:middle line:84%
You don't think apple and
it manifests in your hand.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I'll
say in lots of my lectures,

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.870 align:middle line:84%
so there'll be a point where
you're going to say apple

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:45.835 align:middle line:84%
and the apple is
going to manifest,

00:30:45.835 --> 00:30:47.222 align:middle line:90%
and everybody says, oh, great.

00:30:47.222 --> 00:30:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, would
you like that right now?

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:49.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.070 align:middle line:90%
I'd really like that right now.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.080 align:middle line:84%
I say well, let me
say it again and then

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.270 align:middle line:90%
give me your opinion again.

00:30:54.270 --> 00:31:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So every thought you think
will manifest instantly.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, in that
context, people live

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:04.180 align:middle line:84%
in that habit of
the third dimension,

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.620 align:middle line:84%
throwing energy,
angry, resentful.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Do you really want that apple
to appear in your reality?

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.080 align:middle line:84%
But what is now
happening, the buffer's

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.600 align:middle line:84%
still there, so the apple
is not appearing as of yet.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.250 align:middle line:84%
It will, but it's
a good thing it

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.040 align:middle line:84%
isn't because the
magnetic fields have

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.495 align:middle line:90%
been removed from everyone.

00:31:23.495 --> 00:31:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now this
is something--

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:27.860 align:middle line:84%
is this dealing with the
same essence of material that

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.450 align:middle line:84%
was happening in
the early 1990s,

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:35.964 align:middle line:84%
late 1989 in through '93 and so
when Gregg Braden, for example,

00:31:35.964 --> 00:31:38.380 align:middle line:84%
was writing about the dropping
away of the magnetic field.

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:38.884 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yes.

00:31:38.884 --> 00:31:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, this is a
physical reality, the dropping

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.550 align:middle line:90%
away of these magnetic fields.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yes.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is not.

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: This just
happens to be we've also

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:48.150 align:middle line:90%
stepped into another room.

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:49.950 align:middle line:84%
So in a simple way,
the third dimension

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.230 align:middle line:90%
has been a storm, if you would.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Rain, winds, those
kind of things.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.870 align:middle line:84%
We're now stepping
into the fifth

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.490 align:middle line:84%
and bypassing the
fourth purposely,

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.509 align:middle line:90%
it's a stepping stone.

00:31:58.509 --> 00:31:59.800 align:middle line:90%
I'll talk about it in a second.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.280 align:middle line:84%
But basically, you're stepping
into a fifth dimensional space.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So the big winds are gone,
and the rains are gone.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:08.280 align:middle line:84%
It's still partially
cloudy in my storm.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.670 align:middle line:84%
The temperature has risen, so
it's a little more comfortable.

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:14.565 align:middle line:84%
But it's still
somewhat familiar.

00:32:14.565 --> 00:32:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what happens when
the magnetic field dissipates?

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.180 align:middle line:84%
When we spoke about
earlier, the magnetic field

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.800 align:middle line:84%
is what supports the emotional
portion of the being.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yes.

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.508 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just like the
electrical supports the mind.

00:32:24.508 --> 00:32:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yes.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And so, the people listening
to this are waking up

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and they can hear this
part of the conversation.

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:33.850 align:middle line:84%
But what about the other
6 and 1/2 billion people

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:36.970 align:middle line:84%
on the planet that are not
even close to waking up,

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:39.850 align:middle line:84%
but those magnetic fields
are now being removed?

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And so, one of the
things you're seeing

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:43.890 align:middle line:84%
is we're moving from
kind of that stormy day

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:46.190 align:middle line:84%
to a really wonderful
day, but there's

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:48.180 align:middle line:90%
a transition in between.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're now feeling.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening right this
minute, although people still

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:53.840 align:middle line:90%
aren't putting it all together.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm watching people
be more emotional.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.530 align:middle line:90%
They're saying things quicker.

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:02.034 align:middle line:84%
They're a little bit
more reactionary.

00:33:02.034 --> 00:33:03.450 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that's happening

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:06.450 align:middle line:84%
is it's like paint that's been
very bonded to the houses.

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Now the bonding is
gone, the glue is gone,

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.340 align:middle line:90%
and the flakes are starting.

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:14.542 align:middle line:84%
What's happening is you can't
take your not-OK-ness with you.

00:33:14.542 --> 00:33:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was,
like you say, the glue;

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.125 align:middle line:84%
that was your
protection, so to speak--

00:33:18.125 --> 00:33:18.624 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yes.

00:33:18.624 --> 00:33:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -to be able
to operate like that

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.504 align:middle line:84%
with a certain
amount of impunity.

00:33:22.504 --> 00:33:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, it
wasn't even protection.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.982 align:middle line:84%
It's I'm familiar
in my not-OK-ness.

00:33:26.982 --> 00:33:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I understand.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:30.279 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: I don't like it,
but I'm familiar with it.

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you were
protecting yourself,

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.240 align:middle line:90%
and I mean it in that sense.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:34.749 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:34.749 --> 00:33:39.730 align:middle line:84%
But now that means of
you are now more exposed,

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.950 align:middle line:84%
everything is
beginning to come out.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:44.590 align:middle line:84%

>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: And so when you say
butterfly and little children,

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:55.630 align:middle line:84%
puppy dogs, everybody
goes, oh, that's nice,

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:57.060 align:middle line:90%
but I gotta go to work now.

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.705 align:middle line:84%
And so you don't hold those
higher, faster frequencies

00:40:59.705 --> 00:41:00.960 align:middle line:90%
a long time.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.170 align:middle line:84%
But let me tell you
how bad work is.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And so they stay in
those heavier densities,

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:07.830 align:middle line:90%
third dimension.

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:11.470 align:middle line:84%
But how many thoughts do
people think about I'm so angry

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:13.090 align:middle line:90%
and I don't like that boss?

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:15.720 align:middle line:84%
All those thoughts go
into that astral plane.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Where do you think when you
have bad dreams at night,

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:20.220 align:middle line:90%
you simply disconnect.

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: And what happens is,
you have those thoughts thought

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.140 align:middle line:90%
in your day space.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:26.200 align:middle line:90%
It's like a magnet.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.060 align:middle line:84%
You go into that fourth
dimensional dream space

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and that magnet
connects to all thoughts

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:34.550 align:middle line:84%
like it ever thought,
ever thought.

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:37.570 align:middle line:84%
That's what they've done
studies with people in prison

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and they said what's the
worst part of your day,

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:41.640 align:middle line:90%
and they say going to sleep.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Because
that's where they go.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To have to live
through that night after night

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.486 align:middle line:90%
after night.

00:41:45.486 --> 00:41:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yeah.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so,
you're saying that

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.830 align:middle line:84%
this fourth dimensional
reality, which we are solidly

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:55.590 align:middle line:84%
in-- as of 12/12/12
third dimensional reality

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:58.010 align:middle line:84%
has dissolved, we're just
dragging the old patterns

00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:59.160 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.620 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
what it feels like,

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:04.244 align:middle line:84%
the experience of being
in the fourth dimension,

00:42:04.244 --> 00:42:06.410 align:middle line:84%
even though it's only a
stepping stone to the fifth.

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And you've already
touched on it,

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:09.366 align:middle line:84%
so we'll kind of go
through that and then more

00:42:09.366 --> 00:42:13.700 align:middle line:84%
into how we do this
in a physical world

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:18.000 align:middle line:84%
dependent on structures like
money systems and so forth.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: All right, so
let's just softly talk

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:23.319 align:middle line:90%
about those bad dreams space.

00:42:23.319 --> 00:42:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.943 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: The lower area
where we just talked about,

00:42:25.943 --> 00:42:28.025 align:middle line:84%
let's just keep that soft
because the people who

00:42:28.025 --> 00:42:30.234 align:middle line:84%
are listening to this, they
don't spend a lot of time

00:42:30.234 --> 00:42:30.733 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:42:30.733 --> 00:42:32.610 align:middle line:84%
They're waking up,
they're being clear.

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And so there's different
stratas leading

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:37.690 align:middle line:84%
into well-being and
great beauty and some

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:40.380 align:middle line:84%
of those really wonderful
dreams that people have.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.250 align:middle line:84%
But that fourth
dimensional space,

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:43.970 align:middle line:84%
the simplest way
to define it again

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:48.310 align:middle line:84%
as we did at the beginning,
is present time and choice.

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I can choose right here how
I wish to experience myself.

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And the concept
of paradox, which

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:57.050 align:middle line:84%
means what has always
been in my reality

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:59.410 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have to be in my
reality at this moment.

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:01.870 align:middle line:84%
I can choose a
different reality.

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Those concepts are huge in
this stepping stone process.

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:09.110 align:middle line:84%
As you begin to
play in this process

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:13.160 align:middle line:84%
and you start to bring in
different thought patterns,

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:16.010 align:middle line:84%
the heavier, angrier thought
pattern in present time

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:19.260 align:middle line:84%
will pull you down into that
third dimensional space,

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:20.700 align:middle line:90%
or more rigid area.

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.960 align:middle line:84%
But if you can start
to choose words

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.260 align:middle line:84%
like capable and
certain and happy

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:29.500 align:middle line:84%
and pleased and
gracious and gratitude,

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:32.540 align:middle line:84%
what happens as soon as
you have that thought,

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.040 align:middle line:90%
you also have a feeling.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.706 align:middle line:84%
Now if I said to
you-- and people

00:43:36.706 --> 00:43:38.080 align:middle line:84%
can play with this
on their own--

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I say do you know
what certain is?

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And people say,
intellectually, oh, yeah, I

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:45.070 align:middle line:90%
know what certain is.

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:46.089 align:middle line:90%
I say, OK, I understand.

00:43:46.089 --> 00:43:47.130 align:middle line:90%
But here, do this for me.

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Close your eyes, and
I'd like you to not

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.660 align:middle line:84%
know what certain is, but
would you feel certain.

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
their shoulders go up

00:43:55.700 --> 00:44:00.310 align:middle line:84%
and their head goes up, and
it's a very different sensation.

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:02.750 align:middle line:90%
That's a vibrational frequency.

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:06.110 align:middle line:84%
When you start to
feel the vibration

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:11.319 align:middle line:84%
and you make a conscious present
time choice of holding onto it,

00:44:11.319 --> 00:44:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and then you walk out
the door and you say,

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:15.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try this on
all day long, certain.

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to wear it as a coat.

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:20.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to walk
into a room and simply

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.240 align:middle line:90%
say, hello, nice to see you.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.320 align:middle line:90%
Certain.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.790 align:middle line:84%
As you begin to play with
words, and we'll talk more

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:28.030 align:middle line:84%
about those in another
segment, but as you

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:31.190 align:middle line:84%
begin to recognize
words and you begin

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:35.700 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that choice
comes from a present time

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.990 align:middle line:84%
moment and a place
of observation.

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:41.830 align:middle line:84%
See in choice, you're not
scattered going, yeah, well,

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:43.040 align:middle line:90%
I guess we could do that.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.380 align:middle line:90%
You're not all over the place.

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:48.337 align:middle line:84%
In present time right here
choice, it's like, yes,

00:44:48.337 --> 00:44:49.170 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to do that.

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:53.400 align:middle line:84%
But you are seeing,
observing, experiencing,

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.530 align:middle line:84%
from a point of observation
that's not scattered.

00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:59.400 align:middle line:84%
That's an enormous
piece of this.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you can observe from
a point of consciousness

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and choose what you
wish, you simply

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.560 align:middle line:84%
step out of that
third dimension.

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Now you've got habits
and you'll fall back in.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:14.810 align:middle line:84%
But as you begin to build
these platforms of words,

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:16.640 align:middle line:84%
if you start to
consider just a very

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.620 align:middle line:90%
simple concept, a triangle.

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:22.000 align:middle line:84%
In physical world,
you need geometry.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.089 align:middle line:84%
Starting with a triangle
is a very simple one.

00:45:24.089 --> 00:45:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To create basic form.

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Everything
comes from geometry.

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to
simply say, I'm

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.370 align:middle line:84%
going to create
a little platform

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:33.385 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to choose
a word like certain

00:45:33.385 --> 00:45:35.070 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to feel it.

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And then if I said, eyes
closed, now shift your attention

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:43.490 align:middle line:84%
to capable, feel capable
and feel happy, three words.

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And just put them together
as if they were triangle.

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:51.310 align:middle line:84%
You begin to create a
geometric form, thought form,

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:54.450 align:middle line:90%
in your emotional construct.

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Those thought forms as you
begin to consciously build

00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:59.844 align:middle line:84%
them, start to take on
a life of their own.

00:45:59.844 --> 00:46:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And as you build more
and more of those,

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:05.195 align:middle line:84%
you start vibrating at a
higher frequency of well-being.

00:46:05.195 --> 00:46:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And as this glue is gone
from the fifth dimension--

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
going to about that.

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:09.500 align:middle line:90%
What's the new glue?

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: The new
glue is I feel good.

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:12.070 align:middle line:90%
I like me.

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:13.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm pleased with myself.

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:16.009 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So those finer
frequencies are the new glue.

00:46:16.009 --> 00:46:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Absolutely.

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's
very different.

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Very.

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:19.724 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those
finer frequencies

00:46:19.724 --> 00:46:21.980 align:middle line:84%
are much more fleeting because
they're simply lighter.

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yes.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.960 align:middle line:84%
But see, that's the fourth
dimensional stepping stone.

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.540 align:middle line:90%
Now you're right on it.

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:29.377 align:middle line:84%
So I know what heavy,
ugly, miserable,

00:46:29.377 --> 00:46:30.585 align:middle line:90%
I'm not happy with anything--

00:46:30.585 --> 00:46:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you
can live in the grips

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.290 align:middle line:90%
of that your whole life.

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Right.

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's like glue.

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:33.933 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Right.

00:46:33.933 --> 00:46:35.270 align:middle line:90%
But that glue is now gone.

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:37.130 align:middle line:84%
So now it's going to
start to dissipate.

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
you're going to see

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:41.914 align:middle line:84%
a lot of anger and resentment in
people in the world around you.

00:46:41.914 --> 00:46:43.330 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
why they're angry.

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Because the glue is not
holding me hiding any longer.

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:49.640 align:middle line:84%
But when you step up with
this little platform, just as

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.250 align:middle line:84%
an example, and
you start to build

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:54.990 align:middle line:84%
the platform of well-being
and I'm pleased with myself.

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:58.800 align:middle line:84%
How many times do you feel
pleased with yourself?

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a construct that's
a wonderful construct.

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:03.950 align:middle line:84%
But you begin to build
these little triangles

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:06.710 align:middle line:84%
of happy, certain,
gratitude, well-being staying

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:08.840 align:middle line:84%
in present time,
you find yourself

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.540 align:middle line:84%
moving into this fifth
dimensional reality.

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And in that fifth
dimensional reality,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.870 align:middle line:84%
magical things begin to
be very present to you.

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so it's fair
to say for most people,

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:26.330 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take a
little bit of discipline.

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Because there is
that period of time

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:30.780 align:middle line:84%
where if you find yourself
going into habitual thinking,

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:32.810 align:middle line:84%
you have to stop yourself,
you have to make the choice--

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Sure.

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -I don't
choose to do this.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.697 align:middle line:84%
This isn't assisting anybody,
especially myself, right?

00:47:38.697 --> 00:47:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Right.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.821 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You make the choice
to go into these higher thought

00:47:41.821 --> 00:47:44.957 align:middle line:84%
forms and to embody on
a feeling level, right?

00:47:44.957 --> 00:47:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Right.

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
the choice you make.

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Some assembly required.

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some
assembly required.

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Exactly.

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:50.358 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So this is our job.

00:47:50.358 --> 00:47:52.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the job of
every human being

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:55.880 align:middle line:84%
if we want to be able to merge
into this beautiful reality

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.830 align:middle line:84%
that we're getting
ready to talk about now.

00:47:57.830 --> 00:47:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yes.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to put
another word in there

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:04.247 align:middle line:84%
and that's self-appreciation
and responsibility.

00:48:04.247 --> 00:48:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: It's up to you.

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:09.205 align:middle line:84%
You know, teachers can
show you the door, how

00:48:09.205 --> 00:48:11.580 align:middle line:84%
to turn the doorknob,
how to push the door,

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:13.357 align:middle line:90%
but you've got to push it.

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:14.690 align:middle line:90%
You've got to turn the doorknob.

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:16.148 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's your
responsibility.

00:48:16.148 --> 00:48:17.940 align:middle line:84%
You can choose this
new way, or you

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:20.224 align:middle line:84%
can fight it and deal with
the repercussions of it.

00:48:20.224 --> 00:48:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: But the glue's gone.

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The glue's gone.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to
be uncomfortable.

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yes, it is.

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about what

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.030 align:middle line:84%
happens when we've
made that decision,

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:29.720 align:middle line:84%
we're using our little
triangle platform

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.480 align:middle line:84%
and embodying these
feelings, and now

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.660 align:middle line:84%
what kind of experiences
are we beginning to have,

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:37.412 align:middle line:84%
and what does life function
like in the fifth dimension?

00:48:37.412 --> 00:48:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, one of the
things that begins to happen

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:41.690 align:middle line:84%
is you start to
hold these words,

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:44.250 align:middle line:84%
you start to hold higher,
faster vibrations.

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:46.160 align:middle line:84%
In the higher,
faster vibrations,

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:50.060 align:middle line:84%
it's like opening up the
box to, or emptying the cup

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.880 align:middle line:90%
to receive more.

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:54.040 align:middle line:84%
In this fifth
dimensional space, there

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.230 align:middle line:84%
are new wiring
patterns in the body.

00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: And that's
in all the bodies.

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Something that was never meant
to happen, but did happen

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:06.510 align:middle line:84%
is there was never
meant to be four bodies.

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:07.990 align:middle line:90%
It was always meant to be one.

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:11.300 align:middle line:84%
But very particularly,
the emotional-mental body

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.850 align:middle line:90%
was never meant to be one body.

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:15.960 align:middle line:84%
As you begin to step into
this fifth dimension,

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:19.380 align:middle line:84%
now there's enough templates
being laid out for people just

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:22.080 align:middle line:84%
to step into and take--
own-- for themselves.

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.350 align:middle line:84%
There's no-- it's very
doable, because others

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:27.260 align:middle line:84%
have walked the path
right in front of you.

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like
putting on your coat

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:31.150 align:middle line:90%
and you instantly own it.

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:34.230 align:middle line:84%
But building that
mental-emotional body is

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:38.830 align:middle line:84%
very key, very simple
steps to do this,

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:40.920 align:middle line:84%
some assembly
required, and you have

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.710 align:middle line:84%
to do it in this higher,
faster vibration.

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:45.510 align:middle line:84%
But as you put
that together, you

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:47.760 align:middle line:84%
begin to think with
the heart, and you

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.380 align:middle line:90%
act from the wisdom of the soul.

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:52.940 align:middle line:84%
This soul piece begins
to be extraordinary

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:54.080 align:middle line:90%
because you are the soul.

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:55.240 align:middle line:90%
The soul is you.

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:59.110 align:middle line:84%
But the soul said, I
wish to know myself

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:02.310 align:middle line:84%
and I wish to have
these experiences.

00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:06.770 align:middle line:84%
So it would be like your soul
said, I'd like to be a female,

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to
experience broadcasting.

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else is
experiencing tennis.

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.420 align:middle line:90%
Somebody else is a plumber.

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else is having
different experiences.

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:19.230 align:middle line:84%
But your experiences
this, whatever that is.

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:23.320 align:middle line:84%
But that carbon body is
so dense-- now keep it

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:27.690 align:middle line:84%
in mind the carbon is just
a compression of light,

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:28.440 align:middle line:90%
very compressed.

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, diamonds.

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: So compressed that the
soul cannot get into the body.

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And then when you give up
your little space as a kid

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and you start to
look externally,

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and you move away from that
internal guidance system,

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:45.630 align:middle line:84%
there's no room for the
soul to get into the body.

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And the soul says, go out
to play, and you have.

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:51.430 align:middle line:84%
But as you say, I
want to know more,

00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:53.800 align:middle line:84%
the soul begins to
get your attention,

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.080 align:middle line:90%
or you get its attention.

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.860 align:middle line:84%
The higher self, two
different pieces of the game,

00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.730 align:middle line:84%
begins to come
into an awareness.

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's what everybody
watching this show is doing.

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:06.380 align:middle line:84%
They are beginning to be very
aligned with the possibility

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:10.390 align:middle line:84%
of bringing that alignment in,
as you add those frequencies.

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:14.701 align:middle line:84%
Something extraordinary
happened in 2011.

00:51:14.701 --> 00:51:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And some people have a
hard time with this word,

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:18.350 align:middle line:90%
so let's keep it clear.

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:22.320 align:middle line:84%
The Christed Matrix, the
present of the Christed Light

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.410 align:middle line:90%
came back onto the planet.

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:26.780 align:middle line:84%
An extraordinary
story unto itself.

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:28.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not about a religion.

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:31.850 align:middle line:84%
It is very much about the
man who walked in that space.

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:33.070 align:middle line:90%
But let's soften that.

00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:35.710 align:middle line:84%
We're not going towards
the religious side of this.

00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:39.180 align:middle line:84%
That matrix has been
installed, activated

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:42.040 align:middle line:84%
in the hearts of every
human being on the planet.

00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And so, when you start to draw
the essence of the Creator,

00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:49.840 align:middle line:84%
when you start to
recognize the Holy Spirit.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.670 align:middle line:84%
In religion, most people don't
even know what that means,

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:55.100 align:middle line:84%
but it's an aspect
of the Creator

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:57.560 align:middle line:84%
that begins to be
very consciously

00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:01.010 align:middle line:84%
present in every action
you take in this walking

00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:03.830 align:middle line:84%
around in the body
fifth dimensional space.

00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:07.810 align:middle line:84%
But when you begin to draw
the essence of the Creator

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:11.440 align:middle line:84%
through that Christed
Matrix into the new chakra

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:16.740 align:middle line:84%
system, the 12-point chakra
system, very mechanical, it's

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:20.020 align:middle line:90%
not, oh, I want one of those.

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:24.650 align:middle line:84%
All of this is very
sequentially put in place.

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've been watching thousands
of people doing it week

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:30.660 align:middle line:84%
after week after week
for the last five years,

00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:34.530 align:middle line:84%
instructed by the archangels,
the ascended masters, Yeshua,

00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:37.780 align:middle line:90%
week after week.

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, what
are you seeing

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.690 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to look
at it in total, what

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:44.460 align:middle line:84%
are the dominant themes
and changes you're

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:46.485 align:middle line:90%
seeing emerging in these people?

00:52:46.485 --> 00:52:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: They're
beginning to hold

00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:51.690 align:middle line:84%
this fifth dimensional
space where reaction is not

00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:56.140 align:middle line:84%
a choice, where you begin to
make decisions in present time.

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Where the word allowing
becomes a very huge word.

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I can allow you
to be who you are,

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:05.500 align:middle line:84%
while I choose to allow
me to be who I am.

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:09.490 align:middle line:84%
You begin to have an awareness
of a word like compassion

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:15.200 align:middle line:84%
in a very, very expanded sense
than what we think it is.

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:20.060 align:middle line:84%
The word love, we
know such a minor part

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and we believe we
know everything.

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:23.610 align:middle line:10%
And you don't.

00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:28.820 align:middle line:10%
Love is such an extraordinary--
it's the wind that moves

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:29.400 align:middle line:10%
everything.

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:32.140 align:middle line:10%
It's what pushes the
currents in the oceans.

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:35.670 align:middle line:84%
It's what holds the solar
system in its precision.

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:37.330 align:middle line:90%
And on and on and on.

00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:39.460 align:middle line:84%
You begin to have
an awareness of all

00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:42.999 align:middle line:84%
of those different
concepts and aspects.

00:53:42.999 --> 00:53:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, we only have
a couple minutes left.

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And so it sounds like this
wounded aspect of ourselves

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:49.320 align:middle line:84%
that is known as
the ego that has

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:51.090 align:middle line:84%
to hold onto
constructs, that's done.

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:52.249 align:middle line:90%
Finito.

00:53:52.249 --> 00:53:53.790 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to be
acknowledging it,

00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:55.910 align:middle line:84%
but we don't need to
beat ourselves up either.

00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:58.110 align:middle line:84%
As you say in this
book, this journey,

00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:01.040 align:middle line:84%
this transition you're
making has to feel light.

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.410 align:middle line:90%
It has to be enjoyable.

00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:03.710 align:middle line:90%
It has to be fun.

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:07.240 align:middle line:84%
No more self-flagellation
for where we think we've

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:07.840 align:middle line:90%
screwed up.

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.564 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, there's
not a person that

00:54:09.564 --> 00:54:10.730 align:middle line:90%
hasn't lived this thing out.

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:12.545 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, you
can't be not OK.

00:54:12.545 --> 00:54:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:15.211 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: You've never made
a mistake in your life.

00:54:15.211 --> 00:54:16.810 align:middle line:90%
You've never failed once.

00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:19.310 align:middle line:84%
You've been in an
experience in an experiment

00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:21.130 align:middle line:90%
trying to know yourself.

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And so in that context, you just
kept trying different things

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:25.690 align:middle line:84%
until you found
something worked.

00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:28.370 align:middle line:84%
But what we've done is
we've believed I'm not OK

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:30.810 align:middle line:84%
because the mom, dad,
teacher, minister said so.

00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And so the biggest piece
that is the choppy part

00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:37.210 align:middle line:84%
of this transition
is just recognizing

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:39.570 align:middle line:84%
there are no bad mom,
dad, teacher, ministers,

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:42.070 align:middle line:84%
but what they have
all said to you,

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:45.870 align:middle line:84%
if it doesn't feel good to you,
if it isn't an understanding

00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:49.110 align:middle line:84%
of well-being, it simply
was they had a bad lifetime

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:50.330 align:middle line:90%
one day.

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's all it is,
let it go because it

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.692 align:middle line:84%
was in a past place that
doesn't exist any longer.

00:54:54.692 --> 00:54:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So my understanding
from what you're saying

00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.970 align:middle line:84%
is that all of the
external games and rules

00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:02.234 align:middle line:90%
essentially are no longer valid.

00:55:02.234 --> 00:55:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Correct.

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:05.025 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have to create
our own new rules based

00:55:05.025 --> 00:55:07.370 align:middle line:84%
on our soul's voice
within ourselves.

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:08.164 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Correct.

00:55:08.164 --> 00:55:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:55:08.830 --> 00:55:10.371 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: And it's an
exciting journey.

00:55:10.371 --> 00:55:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, this
gets really interesting

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:16.529 align:middle line:84%
because we're living in very
highly-controlled structures.

00:55:16.529 --> 00:55:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, there are
beings, and we're not

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.910 align:middle line:84%
going to get into
it, there are people,

00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:22.370 align:middle line:84%
there're beings that would like
to see these structure stay

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:23.539 align:middle line:90%
just as dense as they are.

00:55:23.539 --> 00:55:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Sure.

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
is playing out.

00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:27.910 align:middle line:84%
We all know this with a
little nod and a wink,

00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:29.090 align:middle line:90%
we know what's going on.

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:31.080 align:middle line:84%
We can see the darkness
being perpetuated;

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:34.140 align:middle line:84%
we see the hypnagogic
states people are falling

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:36.190 align:middle line:84%
in as a result of
these messages.

00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:38.730 align:middle line:84%
But what we're talking about
is moving beyond all that.

00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be having
a second conversation talking

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:45.840 align:middle line:84%
about some functional
dynamics of going

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.950 align:middle line:84%
into this new
dimensional frequency.

00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:52.840 align:middle line:84%
But just one last comment from
you, if we might, just as a

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:53.945 align:middle line:90%
tease even if it were.

00:55:53.945 --> 00:55:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Sure, sure sure.

00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happens
to these structures,

00:55:57.590 --> 00:56:00.730 align:middle line:84%
particularly things like an
economic structure and means

00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:03.890 align:middle line:84%
of doing business and barter
and so forth with each other.

00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, I could
use the word collapse,

00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:08.370 align:middle line:84%
or I could use the
word transform.

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:10.760 align:middle line:90%
So let me choose transform.

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And the ability to
transition through,

00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:16.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
collapse it is,

00:56:16.570 --> 00:56:18.340 align:middle line:84%
it's simply very
available to you

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:20.840 align:middle line:84%
without pain and
fear and effort.

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, on
that note, we're

00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:24.190 align:middle line:84%
going to have a
second conversation

00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.720 align:middle line:84%
to be aired at a
later time, which

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:28.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm very much
looking forward to.

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I have read
his book and it is truly

00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:33.080 align:middle line:84%
a hands-on guide for
shifting our perspectives.

00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:34.330 align:middle line:90%
You can tell by this.

00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:35.960 align:middle line:84%
It breaks the
hypnotic programming,

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.880 align:middle line:84%
also functionally
moves us forward

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.270 align:middle line:84%
into the higher
frequencies day-to-day.

00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So, we will have
another conversation,

00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:45.620 align:middle line:84%
we're going to introduce you to
the applications and practices,

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:47.500 align:middle line:84%
so stay tuned in
the coming weeks.

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Until then, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
