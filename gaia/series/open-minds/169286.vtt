>>REGINA MEREDITH: Scott
Stevens is back with us

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.850 align:middle line:10%
again to share new information
on extreme weather patterns--

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:10%
hurricanes, eclipses,
and chemtrails.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:84%
The summer of 2017 saw some
crazy weather patterns,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.270 align:middle line:84%
like 113 degree
weather in Marin County

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.790 align:middle line:84%
where it's normally 80
degrees in the summer.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.922 align:middle line:84%
Some of these events were
termed as superheated.

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:49.005 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to Scott and
find out what superheated

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:50.970 align:middle line:90%
and all this other stuff means.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.270 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you again, Scott.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT STEVENS:
Good to see you.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.200 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.700 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be back.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow, I mean.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.855 align:middle line:84%
OK, Jose we're in a
period of time where--

00:00:57.855 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:90%
has Jose finished up yet?

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, OK.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:90%
So he's not.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: He's not.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we've been through
Harvey, just finished Irma,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.700 align:middle line:84%
we're still in the
middle of Jose.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
Harvey, because I

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.710 align:middle line:84%
guess that was the greatest
saturation of rainfall

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.720 align:middle line:84%
in recorded history
in the US, right?

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Monumental rainfall.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.230 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: 52 inches.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: 52 inches, and
then from my understanding

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.070 align:middle line:10%
and what have been
shown and read

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:10%
in records exclaimed to
the world about this storm,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:10%
is that that is the greatest
continental US one-storm event

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.600 align:middle line:10%
rainfall.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.867 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: 52 inches.

00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 52 inches.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That's
4 feet 4 inches.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.190 align:middle line:90%
Holy cow!

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.810 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, and we've
all seen the pictures.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.184 align:middle line:10%
We've all heard from family
and relatives and friends who

00:01:36.184 --> 00:01:37.290 align:middle line:10%
have people there.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.950 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I think the beautiful
thing about it was that--

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.050 align:middle line:10%
and there's the
silver-linings part

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.620 align:middle line:10%
of every story was that it was
so extreme that having learned

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.950 align:middle line:10%
a few lessons from Katrina that
the help came in before it hit.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.840 align:middle line:10%
But mostly it was
the human help.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.520 align:middle line:10%
Everybody got rid
of their divisions

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.030 align:middle line:10%
and really pitched in and
started helping each other,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.230 align:middle line:10%
and in a beautiful
almost unprecedented way.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's the silver lining of
it is when the chips were down,

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.930 align:middle line:84%
the people in Houston
really came together.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.805 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And that's
kind of the other side.

00:02:11.805 --> 00:02:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Whatever political,
financial, military agendas

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.690 align:middle line:84%
may be at work with
these kind of things,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:84%
there is always the
other side of the coin.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And there is the human
element, rather than

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:90%
the animalistic response.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Which we can see
when those kind of situations--

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.540 align:middle line:84%
the food's gone,
the power's gone.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.340 align:middle line:90%
We're all desperate.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And then those
animalistic things,

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:90%
those instincts show up.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.962 align:middle line:84%
But when you know
your neighbors,

00:02:36.962 --> 00:02:38.420 align:middle line:84%
you know your
neighborhood, and you

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.710 align:middle line:84%
know who needs what and
have the ability to help;

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:90%
we tend to help.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.860 align:middle line:90%
We tend to help.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
beautiful part of it.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:90%
The rest of it was crazy.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And we'll let the fur fly on
this one here in a good way.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Because-- and you
and I are pretty

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:90%
much on the same page on this.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is everyone's
pointing-- all the newscasts

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.857 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, global
climate change.

00:03:00.857 --> 00:03:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Global climate change is
responsible for these patterns,

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and there are some insane
patterns, like I mentioned.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.860 align:middle line:84%
However, virtually
none of them talk

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.560 align:middle line:84%
about geoengineering and global
climate change having anything

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.470 align:middle line:84%
to do with quote,
"geoengineering," the less

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.020 align:middle line:90%
polite term, chemtrailing.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can't have
that conversation.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.590 align:middle line:10%
No one can talk intelligently
about that phenomena,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.914 align:middle line:10%
unless they address
geoengineering, right?

00:03:30.914 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It's like
having an apple pie

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:84%
and that was a great apple pie,
but there was no apples in it.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: This key
ingredient, this key factor

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.384 align:middle line:90%
is not being discussed.

00:03:42.384 --> 00:03:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
even Al Gore talks

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.530 align:middle line:84%
about geoengineering and its
reality and the need for it.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.390 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to the actual
implications of it happening

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.800 align:middle line:84%
around the globe over thousands
of miles, hundreds of thousands

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.750 align:middle line:84%
of miles of territory,
back and forth, no one

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.865 align:middle line:90%
we'll talk about it.

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:01.330 align:middle line:84%
So now you need
to talk about it.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Well, and there are
a couple of reasons for that.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.150 align:middle line:84%
A, and I the most
important one is

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.270 align:middle line:84%
that there are very few experts
who can go on the evening news

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.522 align:middle line:90%
to talk about this subject.

00:04:10.522 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
it's verboten, for one.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Because
it's all conjecture.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:84%
What happens if we could we
and do we have the technology

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:22.340 align:middle line:84%
to modify, to mitigate, to
enhance, or to bring rain;

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.900 align:middle line:90%
it's still all conjecture.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.160 align:middle line:84%
We allegedly have this ability
to make it rain over the Ho Chi

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.710 align:middle line:90%
Minh trail back in the '60s.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes, we did.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we did.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Oh, yes we did.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's been
used since World War II.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: How many
years ago was that?

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: World War II
was a lot of years ago.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: 70.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
talking 70 years ago.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And then
Vietnam was 50 years ago.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 50 years
ago, we were already

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.300 align:middle line:84%
using weather modification
for military advantage.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:90%
Now it's just common.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Everyone-- you look
up, you're going

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.072 align:middle line:84%
to see chemtrails in the
sky, depending on where

00:04:47.072 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:90%
you are in a given day.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And so do you think,
if they would deploy technology

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.230 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s to rain out an
adversary that in the '70s

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:84%
they didn't try more
or less overt methods?

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: We have a
nice big fat budget

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:84%
that showed up after World
War II, all through the '50s.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's gather the technology, the
expertise that the Germans may

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:84%
have been working on, the
technologies from Tesla

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.340 align:middle line:84%
which resides still only in
the deep state's portfolio.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's play with
those technologies.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And how
do we then deploy

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.590 align:middle line:84%
that in a day-to-day basis, so
that the population down below

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.670 align:middle line:84%
is unbeknownst to
what's happening?

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.136 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into this
from a lot of different levels,

00:05:31.136 --> 00:05:33.840 align:middle line:84%
like how it's done, how it
can cost-effectively be done

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.480 align:middle line:84%
and is being done
in your research.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.377 align:middle line:84%
And again, when it
comes down to cost,

00:05:39.377 --> 00:05:41.460 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed Catherine
Austin Fitts not long ago.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And she said, how do
you have $9 trillion

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.340 align:middle line:84%
missing from your
country's budget?

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.880 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.930 align:middle line:90%
Where does that go?

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.013 align:middle line:90%
Well it goes to black ops.

00:05:51.013 --> 00:05:52.610 align:middle line:84%
It goes to
unacknowledged programs

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.750 align:middle line:84%
such as chemtrailing,
HAARP, and so forth;

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.950 align:middle line:90%
both implicated in this.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And you
wonder why the Fed is

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.720 align:middle line:90%
so resistant about an auditing.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:84%
It's because that
money, even if it

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.800 align:middle line:84%
is magic digits that
just show up and go over

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:84%
to somebody's bank account,
that magic digit showed up out

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:90%
of somebody's source.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.270 align:middle line:90%
And I think it was--

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.630 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Gore that
even said when Katrina hit,

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.480 align:middle line:84%
it could have been designed
to have a different outcome.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.020 align:middle line:90%
OK, what's that mean?

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.800 align:middle line:84%
It means it could have
been geoengineered to have

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.870 align:middle line:90%
had a different outcome.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.719 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have to
hit there that way.

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No, it didn't.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And just like Harvey.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Harvey is sitting offshore.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:84%
You can do whatever
you want with it.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.245 align:middle line:84%
The technology is there
to take the slats out

00:06:34.245 --> 00:06:35.300 align:middle line:90%
of it pretty much.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Well, and five
days before Harvey's arrival,

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I had noticed off
the coast of Oregon,

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.360 align:middle line:84%
because I'm looking at the
West, living in Colorado,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm always looking West.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Rarely do I look
what's happened,

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.157 align:middle line:84%
what's already
passed my location.

00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And being out of the
media, and having

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.250 align:middle line:84%
to deal with those things
day to day, I can do that.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to be
concerned with what's

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.990 align:middle line:90%
passed over the head.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:90%
So I'm looking to the West.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing this little
ripple in the jet stream, but--

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.650 align:middle line:84%
boom, boom, boom, boom,
loaded with trails,

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:03.632 align:middle line:90%
loaded with trails.

00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:04.840 align:middle line:90%
And so I come over the model.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
guys got superheated.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Oregon was having
a horrible heat.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:90%
It's just now ending.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:84%
But then I looked
along the model

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.620 align:middle line:84%
to see what that little impulse
was that they were trailing.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And that would
have been an event

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000 align:middle line:84%
to have made Harvey a 36-hour
storm, and not a 6-day storm.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.910 align:middle line:84%
So if that event
had been accentuated

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:84%
to carve in, sweep down, and
pick up Harvey and take it off

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.940 align:middle line:84%
to the East, we would have
had a 14-inch rainfall and not

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:90%
a 52-inch rainfall.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.750 align:middle line:84%
So there was a concerted
effort to leave

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.367 align:middle line:84%
that storm stranded on the Texas
coast for as long as possible.

00:07:43.367 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And same with
Katrina, apparently.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.656 align:middle line:84%
Well, and there were
probably other things

00:07:47.656 --> 00:07:48.780 align:middle line:90%
that happened with Katrina.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.051 align:middle line:10%
Because the storm itself
wasn't that spectacular,

00:07:51.051 --> 00:07:53.550 align:middle line:10%
but the flooding in the Ninth
Ward in those lower elevations

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:54.075 align:middle line:10%
was.

00:07:54.075 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, yeah.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: So was--

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.110 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And the compromise
of the infrastructure.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.401 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: Of the levees,
the compromise of the levees.

00:08:00.401 --> 00:08:02.710 align:middle line:10%
That is a very politically
correct way of saying it.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:90%
It didn't have to be.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.653 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It didn't have to be.

00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So going back to
Harvey, so this devastated

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Houston, 30% of the homes under
water, more than 100 people

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:90%
died.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.093 align:middle line:84%
And it could have been worse
had they not been prepared.

00:08:15.093 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And they were prepared and it
still went down that poorly.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
storm and the anomalies

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.252 align:middle line:84%
beyond what you noticed when you
were off the coast of Oregon.

00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It was simply
that that event didn't

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.799 align:middle line:90%
have to be as long as it was.

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:90%
The hurricane was coming.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:90%
That was a given.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.679 align:middle line:84%
And the signatures
were in that storm

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.840 align:middle line:84%
to let us know that
the geoengineers had

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.169 align:middle line:90%
their hand in it.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:38.409 align:middle line:84%
And the underlying
storm was going

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.760 align:middle line:90%
to be at a healthy 2 or 3.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.340 align:middle line:90%
But it just didn't have to stay.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:84%
That little impulse
laden with chemtrails.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And in my research, once you
start leaving those trails,

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.464 align:middle line:84%
you're measuring some
impact that you're

00:08:52.464 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:90%
doing with that storm.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like taking
a football field

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and you've got the yard lines
running across the track,

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
across the field
and shifting it.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got one
side five yards ahead

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.354 align:middle line:90%
of the rest of the field.

00:09:05.354 --> 00:09:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens
with the trails,

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.760 align:middle line:84%
is literally they break
and tear off to one side.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And so you're manipulating the
atmosphere in many little spots

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:90%
slightly.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you've begun that
adjustment 2,000 miles away,

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.960 align:middle line:84%
five days ahead of time, it can
have a big impact downstream.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So small
impulse, days ahead of time,

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.035 align:middle line:90%
big results in real time.

00:09:30.035 --> 00:09:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of course, this
brings up many questions.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's too early
to talk about those.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.250 align:middle line:84%
We have other things
to get to, which

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.760 align:middle line:90%
is, why would anybody do that.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Why would they want to pump up
a storm rather than deflate it?

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And then what is the
political agenda behind it?

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Because we can stop there
for maybe just a moment.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:84%
The political
climate surrounding

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.880 align:middle line:84%
the subject of
global climate change

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and the warming of
the weather patterns;

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.040 align:middle line:84%
well, when you have almost like
a constant man-made inversion

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.450 align:middle line:84%
layer of some
kind, you are going

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.910 align:middle line:84%
to change the temperatures
of the land and of the sea

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:01.710 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean is it fair to
say that chemtrails

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.614 align:middle line:84%
are implicated in what they're
calling global climate change?

00:10:07.614 --> 00:10:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I think
ultimately they

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:90%
want a one-world government.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you can find
a cause, a reason

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.480 align:middle line:84%
to have all of the
governments sign

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.390 align:middle line:84%
an accord, this time
the Paris Accord, then

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:24.750 align:middle line:84%
they all come under the
umbrella of this authority.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And once you have this
authority with the ability

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.720 align:middle line:84%
to tax and to dictate
usage, you can then

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.280 align:middle line:84%
create a revenue stream, a
carbon tax to this authority,

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.220 align:middle line:90%
which then has global reach.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And then where does that
money go and to what purpose?

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:84%
They're going to tell
you, as they always do,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.110 align:middle line:90%
it's going to go to the poor.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:84%
So we can help bring
them into the modern age.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.335 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It never
ends up there.

00:10:46.335 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:90%
That we know.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.764 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Well,
the poor are not

00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:51.240 align:middle line:84%
the users and
creators of "carbon,"

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.970 align:middle line:84%
which in this scenario
is the boogie man.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So there's
already some misplaced logic

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and reasoning that the
sane person can figure out.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:06.030 align:middle line:84%
However, if they're
using chemtrails

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:10.880 align:middle line:84%
to enhance weather events, it
may happen a couple dozen times

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.520 align:middle line:90%
a year we have big ones.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And then every time we
have one of those events,

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and say it's every two weeks
just for averaging it out;

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.500 align:middle line:84%
then we have our attention
on the news every two weeks

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.700 align:middle line:90%
about a disaster.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And if it's surrounded
around this theme that

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.710 align:middle line:84%
it's being caused by you
and me driving our cars--

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And we need
to get rid of carbon.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.420 align:middle line:84%
But yet they're going to
offer any Tesla-like solutions

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.235 align:middle line:90%
to gasoline.

00:11:37.235 --> 00:11:39.193 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I was going
to say the irony here

00:11:39.193 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:84%
is our country totally
supports the oil industry.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.995 align:middle line:90%
And this is about what?

00:11:42.995 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Grossly
supporting it.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And so if the
solution is getting off oil,

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, hybrid cars
are not the answer.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a great start.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.400 align:middle line:90%
But it is not the end game.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:58.020 align:middle line:84%
The end game is to roll out
an entirely new economy based

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
on energy from the
vacuum, based from energy

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.320 align:middle line:84%
from the negative resistor,
based on stuff that dozens

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.590 align:middle line:84%
and dozens and dozens of
inventors have brought forth,

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:84%
tried to present to
Congress, and end up dead.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dead, exactly.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So the hypocrisy
within this is huge.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's another little
hidden agenda in that too.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.370 align:middle line:10%
And that is if you do have
a global governance that

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:24.300 align:middle line:10%
has to do with, quote,
"carbon emissions,"

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.300 align:middle line:10%
you can also isolate countries
who you're not seeing favorably

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.630 align:middle line:10%
at any given time.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.430 align:middle line:90%
They can be--

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Sanctions.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sanctions, exactly.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yeah,
exactly sanctions.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.590 align:middle line:90%
And China would be one of those.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:37.770 align:middle line:10%
Because the bulk of their
power has been coal-produced,

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:10%
coal brought from Australia
and their own coal fields,

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.890 align:middle line:10%
and North Korea as well.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.657 align:middle line:84%
So China is this massive
consumer of coal.

00:12:46.657 --> 00:12:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they're also,
I think, at the leading edge

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.840 align:middle line:90%
of solar installations now.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: They're understanding
that they have to be.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And so they're leading
the charge in that.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.350 align:middle line:84%
They're the producers
of some of the most--

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.352 align:middle line:84%
the best and most efficient
panels in the world now.

00:13:01.352 --> 00:13:02.310 align:middle line:90%
And they're using them.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:05.214 align:middle line:84%
So I mean that even has its
own other side of the story,

00:13:05.214 --> 00:13:06.630 align:middle line:84%
because they
understand they can't

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.170 align:middle line:84%
continue with that kind
of air quality themselves.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No, they can't.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.226 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's a
relatively easy fix too.

00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And so if we're
going to play this green game,

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and I don't use that
term disparagingly,

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:22.250 align:middle line:84%
because ultimate green is an
energy source that you produce

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.860 align:middle line:84%
once and it runs forever, at
least as long as you and I are

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.200 align:middle line:84%
going to be alive,
rather than something

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.380 align:middle line:84%
that stops when the
wind stops, or goes

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.140 align:middle line:90%
dark when the sun goes down.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Those are band-aids
over a gaping wound.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:38.910 align:middle line:84%
We have an insatiable
appetite for energy.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And anytime there's
a new energy source

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:84%
that comes online when we
went from whales to oil,

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.640 align:middle line:90%
which was a gift--

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.711 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:46.711 --> 00:13:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, they were
being hunted to an extreme.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.834 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:49.834 --> 00:13:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And so now we're
hunting this last oil source

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:90%
to an extreme.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So something else is
going to come along.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: But until we take the
money out of the hands of those

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.360 align:middle line:84%
that make money from
this that have stopped

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.420 align:middle line:84%
our own invention and
our own inventors,

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.790 align:middle line:90%
nothing's going to change.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.730 align:middle line:84%
This is how I got into
the whole geoengineering

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:84%
schtick in the first place, was
my research into free energy.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That
was the whole thing

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.316 align:middle line:84%
that led me down this
little rabbit hole

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:20.165 align:middle line:84%
that I had no idea
I stumbled into.

00:14:20.165 --> 00:14:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
it's interesting.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Because here you
have on one hand

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:28.710 align:middle line:84%
a rather clear picture
of a political agenda

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:32.456 align:middle line:84%
that serves the few who
put it together, basically.

00:14:32.456 --> 00:14:33.330 align:middle line:90%
That's who it serves.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: The status quo.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Totally
contradicting the support

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.370 align:middle line:84%
of the fossil fuel based
industry in the Western world,

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:45.480 align:middle line:84%
and particularly in the
United States, especially now.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So you have that
contradiction to begin with.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.500 align:middle line:90%
But then you have the human--

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.260 align:middle line:84%
I think what people have a hard
time putting their minds around

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.100 align:middle line:84%
with this is the human
factor, which is why would you

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.040 align:middle line:84%
allow events of that nature
to be created that will create

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.450 align:middle line:90%
so much suffering.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to call
in the entire economy,

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.790 align:middle line:84%
the insurance companies to
clean it up financially.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Where does that come from?

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Emergency funds from
our government's budget.

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:14.116 align:middle line:84%
It's such a mess to
create one agenda.

00:15:14.116 --> 00:15:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: That's the word.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a mess.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like going into
a cattle feed yard

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.070 align:middle line:90%
and saying that pile is bad.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And all you see are
mounds of manure everywhere.

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:28.469 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And that's
really all this is.

00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's just
get into it a little more

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.970 align:middle line:90%
technologically, I think.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:38.640 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at one site
now, a fellow named--

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.260 align:middle line:84%
his page is called
Pacific Redwoods.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.100 align:middle line:90%
You know that guy?

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I don't.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're going to
hear a little bit of it.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.120 align:middle line:10%
He tracks these
storms and he follows

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:10%
the whole geoengineering story.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And he follows the satellite
imagery and points out

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.580 align:middle line:84%
where HAARP is being
introduced, where

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:57.960 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic impulses are
coming into the storm itself,

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.350 align:middle line:90%
the hurricane as it's mounting.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I've seen
websites similar.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Or maybe it
was his, I don't know.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.946 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It could be.

00:16:03.946 --> 00:16:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at it
so you can explain how

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.520 align:middle line:90%
does HAARP interface with this.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.730 align:middle line:90%
You want to talk about that?

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:11.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:14.070 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at this
video from Pacific Redwood.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:18.610 align:middle line:84%
This was from September 8, as
Irma was approaching Florida.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.520 align:middle line:84%
I think it had
already ravaged some

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.530 align:middle line:84%
of the other smaller
countries that are really

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:23.957 align:middle line:90%
devastated in its path.

00:16:23.957 --> 00:16:24.757 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:16:24.757 --> 00:16:27.440 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.860 align:middle line:10%
>>(ON VIDEO): OK, today is
September the 8th, 2017.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.260 align:middle line:10%
It's about 9:30 AM
here on the West coast,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.360 align:middle line:10%
and we're watching Hurricane
Irma, which is producing

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.160 align:middle line:10%
150 mile per hour winds.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.990 align:middle line:90%
It's now a category 4 storm.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And we can see some transmitter
manipulation on this storm.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Here in the visible
light map, right here

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.740 align:middle line:84%
on the northwest
side of the storm,

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.350 align:middle line:84%
we can see several
areas that are

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.970 align:middle line:90%
being targeted with microwave.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's go ahead and scroll
through the loop here.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Frame by frame, we can
see this area right here.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.069 align:middle line:84%
All these little
pock marks are where

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.740 align:middle line:84%
the transmitter is
hitting and superheating

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.089 align:middle line:90%
the bands of that storm.

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:13.220 align:middle line:84%
As we advance to
the next frame, we

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.420 align:middle line:84%
can see that these
will expand out

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and also they've hit the
center of this storm too.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.240 align:middle line:90%
Watch the center.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back one frame.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And that is disrupting the
convective process right there

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:29.574 align:middle line:90%
in the eye wall.

00:17:29.574 --> 00:17:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
basically he went on

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:36.020 align:middle line:84%
to say that if they're
going to modify

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.980 align:middle line:84%
weather, why'd they
do it this way?

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.672 align:middle line:90%
It was too little too late.

00:17:39.672 --> 00:17:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So much more could
have been done, again,

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.780 align:middle line:84%
to really kick the slats
out of Irma coming in.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.580 align:middle line:90%
What is happening?

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.914 align:middle line:90%
First of all, you go ahead.

00:17:47.914 --> 00:17:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yeah,
because I kind of

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.621 align:middle line:90%
want to go somewhere with this.

00:17:50.621 --> 00:17:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure do.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: There's not
an event that there isn't

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:56.740 align:middle line:90%
a couple of reasons as to why.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.590 align:middle line:84%
One may simply be, and this
would be the greed aspect

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:03.860 align:middle line:90%
to allow for reconstruction.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.230 align:middle line:84%
The business and the
business of rebuilding,

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:07.430 align:middle line:90%
it is absolutely a business.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean war is great for that.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's terribly expensive.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very bad
way of doing business.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:16.267 align:middle line:84%
But down here, that's
how our bankers think

00:18:16.267 --> 00:18:18.350 align:middle line:84%
and those families that
run the banks, they think.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:19.880 align:middle line:90%
They finance both sides.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:20.900 align:middle line:90%
They blow each other up.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
reconstruction loans

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.330 align:middle line:90%
that the taxpayers pay ante up.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.470 align:middle line:84%
They go on for decades
between countries.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, it's
just this endless sauce

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.280 align:middle line:84%
that comes out of the bank
that feeds the rebuilding.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.800 align:middle line:90%
And then we're further indebted.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.700 align:middle line:84%
The other side in this is going
to go a little bit the larger

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.319 align:middle line:84%
scope of things is,
we might be having

00:18:39.319 --> 00:18:41.360 align:middle line:84%
a very different discussion
in maybe two or three

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.120 align:middle line:84%
years' time about what's
happening with the oceans

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.280 align:middle line:90%
and ocean levels.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.120 align:middle line:84%
There may be events
in the Canary Islands.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.950 align:middle line:90%
There may be earthquakes.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't just
a shot across the bow

00:18:55.300 --> 00:19:00.290 align:middle line:84%
to those that feel the call to
leave living by the seaside.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.360 align:middle line:84%
They're like, oh, I
can't do this anymore.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And that isn't
going to necessarily

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.460 align:middle line:90%
be a conscious decision.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.820 align:middle line:84%
It could be something coming
from the inside of them,

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.030 align:middle line:84%
the subjective side
of themselves, saying,

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:11.960 align:middle line:90%
Florida is great.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.300 align:middle line:90%
But it's not worth it.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.480 align:middle line:84%
This illusion of living in the
Sunshine State, the traffic

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.710 align:middle line:84%
that is beyond a nightmare,
the heat and the people

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:90%
living on this flat sandbar.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're building expensive
condos next to the coast

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:29.360 align:middle line:90%
on sand.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.193 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know
hurricanes are coming

00:19:31.193 --> 00:19:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and they always have to
one degree or another.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:90%
So that is true.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.100 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to
the manipulation.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:42.890 align:middle line:84%
How does the superheating or
the heating of the ionosphere

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.760 align:middle line:90%
through HAARP play into this?

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Because chemtrails don't
operate independently.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.310 align:middle line:84%
There are other factors
working with them.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And what he
was actually looking at,

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.137 align:middle line:90%
he's got a polarities wrong.

00:19:52.137 --> 00:19:52.970 align:middle line:90%
They're not heating.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:53.630 align:middle line:90%
They're cooling.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cooling, OK.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:55.395 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: They're cooling.

00:19:55.395 --> 00:20:00.146 align:middle line:84%
You cool the top of a storm
to enhance its updraft.

00:20:00.146 --> 00:20:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Because that makes
the atmosphere

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.065 align:middle line:90%
below rise more violently.

00:20:04.065 --> 00:20:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that makes sense.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.240 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: And a
lot of people, even

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.100 align:middle line:10%
Wilhelm Reich when he first
discovered orgone energy,

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.450 align:middle line:10%
got the polarities wrong.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.620 align:middle line:10%
He called it cloud busters,
when in reality they

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:10%
are cloud accumulators.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:15.470 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.150 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: They were drawing to
the instruments, the moisture,

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:22.070 align:middle line:10%
the etheric juice, if you
will, that then drew in very

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:10%
quickly the water molecule.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So either
way, is this something

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.317 align:middle line:90%
that HAARP interfaces with?

00:20:26.317 --> 00:20:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I'm sure it's active.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:28.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure it's active.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I mean
it's active all over.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not just an
array up in Alaska.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:32.190 align:middle line:90%
They're all over.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And he would need to
go through those slower, frame

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:90%
by frame.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And then also understanding
that HAARP is one tool.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: You do
not build a house

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:40.600 align:middle line:90%
with a hammer or a screwdriver.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you've
got chemtrails.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.170 align:middle line:90%
You have HAARP.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.610 align:middle line:90%
You have-- what else do we have?

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: There's the
orgone is the big one.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
orgone as well.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Because
that is the foundation.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.055 align:middle line:84%
You don't grow anything
without a life force present.

00:20:51.055 --> 00:20:55.590 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So no how could an
orgone accumulator have been--

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:58.270 align:middle line:10%
just this is theoretically,
we're not saying it happened--

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:59.457 align:middle line:10%
involve--

00:20:59.457 --> 00:20:59.645 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: Allegedly.

00:20:59.645 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Allegedly
involved in some--

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.910 align:middle line:84%
we're both from a newsroom,
so we say allegedly, right--

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:08.470 align:middle line:84%
allegedly involved in something
like a Harvey, Irma, or Jose?

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Well, we're already--

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:11.840 align:middle line:84%
let's just say the
orgone field is

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.480 align:middle line:84%
the breath, where it's going to
breathe in and out, in and out.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Every single day there's this
process that's happening.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:84%
It's much like the worm
which is always curling,

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.020 align:middle line:84%
is always curling as it
tries to move forward.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.550 align:middle line:10%
And what the scalar
technology does,

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.380 align:middle line:10%
and the acoustic
technology does,

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:34.760 align:middle line:10%
is it inflicts, impresses,
constrains this energy

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:10%
into a shape.

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you mark how
this energy is being

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.584 align:middle line:90%
altered by the technology.

00:21:40.584 --> 00:21:41.916 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It focuses the energy.

00:21:41.916 --> 00:21:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It focuses through
the science of cymatics.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.249 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:45.249 --> 00:21:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So if
you google cymatics,

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find oodles
and oodles of videos.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Different frequencies,
different sized particles

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.650 align:middle line:84%
will bounce and resonate
into different shapes.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they're doing, is

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:84%
so they've got on these
planes these transmitters.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so first
of all, on certain planes

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.297 align:middle line:84%
you have the nozzles that are
spraying out the chemicals.

00:22:05.297 --> 00:22:07.130 align:middle line:84%
You have the array of
HAARP around the world

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:84%
that can pretty much
direct their beam--

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:13.132 align:middle line:84%
not a beam, whatever
you call it--

00:22:13.132 --> 00:22:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I'm
going to back up--

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.078 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --project
their RF frequencies.

00:22:15.078 --> 00:22:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: --and say
HAARP is like a shotgun.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: You've got
something along that--

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.910 align:middle line:90%
[CHOOM]

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, so it can
project the frequencies

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.090 align:middle line:90%
wherever they want.

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Now add this other piece in and
show us what this looks like

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.160 align:middle line:90%
and how it all works together.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And that's
the sound of the--

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.158 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The focused scalar?

00:22:31.158 --> 00:22:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yes, that becomes the
resonance field that holds all

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.345 align:middle line:90%
of these into their own shapes.

00:22:36.345 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And so as you're going to shift
the transmitter from 18 of them

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:45.350 align:middle line:84%
in Colorado over to Kansas, and
to Wyoming, and to Nebraska,

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.080 align:middle line:84%
you're just slowly stepping
these storms over bit by bit

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.070 align:middle line:90%
by bit.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:53.129 align:middle line:84%
And it's so computationally
intense that it's--

00:22:53.129 --> 00:22:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, let me
get my mind around it.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like a
saturated life force

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:02.060 align:middle line:84%
energy field that's
defined that is created

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:84%
in which these other things can
come in and interface and start

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:05.750 align:middle line:90%
playing out.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Thank you.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And it
is that definition,

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:10.450 align:middle line:90%
because there is a defined--

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.075 align:middle line:84%
there are defined
boundaries-- and this

00:23:12.075 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:84%
is what the chemtrails
do, as they come out

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and they mark these
defined boundaries.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And as they leave their
different-sized particles

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.700 align:middle line:84%
in there, they can
watch it from space,

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.550 align:middle line:84%
see how the different
layers are moving,

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:29.990 align:middle line:84%
and they can understand what
to stimulate, what to inhibit,

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.420 align:middle line:90%
what to put ripples up in.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.070 align:middle line:84%
So you see though the undulating
clouds, the standing wave

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.440 align:middle line:84%
clouds, which then
slow down the storm

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.350 align:middle line:84%
off the coast of Oregon that
could have picked up Harvey

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.660 align:middle line:84%
and then swept it
out to sea sooner.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.670 align:middle line:90%
So it is very complex.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And our commercial airlines
are a part of the program.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:47.480 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about this.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.521 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned a bit ago and
I've seen the pictures,

00:23:49.521 --> 00:23:51.800 align:middle line:84%
the close-ups on the nozzles
releasing the chemicals

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.756 align:middle line:90%
of the chemtrails.

00:23:52.756 --> 00:23:54.380 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying
they have the ability

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.420 align:middle line:84%
to transmit these
scalar wave frequencies?

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:01.160 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, and
one very basic website,

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.152 align:middle line:10%
Etheric Rain Engineering.

00:24:03.152 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Etheric
Rain Engineering.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.790 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: All one word,
and these guys in the '90s

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:10.920 align:middle line:10%
went to Singapore, because
the atmosphere is humid,

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.497 align:middle line:10%
and it's rich,
it's in the oceans.

00:24:12.497 --> 00:24:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's ripe.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's ripe.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.160 align:middle line:90%
That is the best way to put it.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.620 align:middle line:90%
It is ripe.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And so they could get
up on literally a small

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Cessna 172, 152, a small plane;
and put these ionizing tubes,

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.020 align:middle line:84%
just like stainless steel tubes
no more than 4-4 and 1/2 feet

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.390 align:middle line:90%
long outside the plane.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And they can turn over the
entire etheric field, just

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:38.090 align:middle line:84%
like a canoe going through
a still pond in the morning.

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:42.160 align:middle line:84%
The sea literally opens up and
the thunderstorms would begin.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:42.960 align:middle line:90%
And it would rain.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.543 align:middle line:84%
And they had to go
to Singapore simply

00:24:44.543 --> 00:24:47.820 align:middle line:84%
because it's not as litigious
as the United States is.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: And this is why--

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.598 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what did
these experiments yield?

00:24:51.598 --> 00:24:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Water, water.

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:57.130 align:middle line:84%
One man by the name of James
DeMeo, University of Kansas.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know James DeMeo.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:58.850 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed
him a couple times.

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, had been
to Africa, made it rain.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He made
it rain in Israel

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.140 align:middle line:84%
initially, which is how
he gained his reputation

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.080 align:middle line:90%
through the Israeli government.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.145 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It works.

00:25:08.145 --> 00:25:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And so another man-- well
once wants the government--

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use
the term blatantly

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.425 align:middle line:90%
because that's what it was.

00:25:14.425 --> 00:25:17.020 align:middle line:10%
They killed Wilhelm Reich in
the '50s, took his paperwork,

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.853 align:middle line:10%
burned everything else
in the public hatter,

00:25:18.853 --> 00:25:21.310 align:middle line:10%
or the largest part of it.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Then they could bring that into
the military industrial complex

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.340 align:middle line:90%
and figure it out.

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.469 align:middle line:84%
And by the '60s they
knew what was going on.

00:25:28.469 --> 00:25:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that
they couldn't have

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.920 align:middle line:84%
their own fleet of bombers and
military planes up there flying

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.720 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.170 align:middle line:84%
That would raise way
too much suspicion.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And because Boeing,
and McDonnell Douglas,

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:43.840 align:middle line:84%
and Northrop, and Grumman
and all these other aircraft

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.370 align:middle line:84%
companies were building
planes for the military,

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:50.920 align:middle line:84%
they're like, how do
we get this deployed.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.020 align:middle line:90%
Help us get this deployed.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So when the new
707s, the new 727s,

00:25:56.090 --> 00:26:00.640 align:middle line:84%
the new 737s; all these
planes were being engineered

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.780 align:middle line:90%
on the drawing board.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:05.670 align:middle line:84%
This stuff had to be on
board from the get go.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And then with GPS satellites,
with satellite communications,

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.900 align:middle line:90%
the pilots have to do nothing.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.730 align:middle line:84%
It can all happen
remote, all of it.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So doesn't have to be a
switch in the cockpit, no.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.347 align:middle line:84%
This stuff just goes on
and then it turns off.

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And the plane is directed
a little over here

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.910 align:middle line:84%
to intercept that funky
looking twist in a cloud.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:28.760 align:middle line:84%
It will go right through
the middle of it.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And he's got passengers
on board, but--

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then pump up the
power of that particular trail?

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, or just
see what it's doing.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or see
what it's doing, OK.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.691 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: See what it's doing.

00:26:36.691 --> 00:26:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Apply a 3-watt solution to
it from the orgone thing

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.100 align:middle line:90%
and the thing will brighten up.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.050 align:middle line:10%
We're dealing with
really low energies,

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:46.290 align:middle line:10%
we really, really are because
the atmosphere is so finely

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:47.526 align:middle line:10%
balanced.

00:26:47.526 --> 00:26:48.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: See,
the thing is and I

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.750 align:middle line:10%
think a lot of people's
perception and mine

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:57.450 align:middle line:10%
was to a large extent that these
are done through contractors,

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:00.570 align:middle line:10%
they're done through
military transport,

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:01.830 align:middle line:10%
through cargo transport.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.470 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying on
normal passenger flights

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:06.630 align:middle line:84%
even this is occurring
all the time,

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.650 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's making it
cost effective for the delivery?

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yeah,
to use every asset

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.620 align:middle line:90%
available to you, everything.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So has
anybody tracked,

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:20.100 align:middle line:84%
been able to track a flight,
follow it and track it,

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.100 align:middle line:90%
a commercial flight?

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Watch where it's taken
off from, knowing it's

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:24.700 align:middle line:90%
a commercial passenger flight.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Watch where they're
spraying, watch it land.

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: We have
an app for that.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You do?

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: There
are apps for that.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that app?

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Flight Radar
24 is a great one.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.600 align:middle line:10%
And then spend a little
extra money, like $4

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.180 align:middle line:10%
and get the
professional version.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.332 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: FlightRadar.com?

00:27:37.332 --> 00:27:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Flight
Radar, that'll probably

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.699 align:middle line:84%
get you at a very minimum that
will get you the google return.

00:27:43.699 --> 00:27:44.990 align:middle line:90%
The Flight Radar 24 is the app.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, 24.

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:47.745 align:middle line:84%
24, that's when
I missed, 24.com.

00:27:47.745 --> 00:27:49.453 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And something
else that you'll

00:27:49.453 --> 00:27:52.630 align:middle line:84%
see on that app, as you begin
to watch the sky if you're not

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:55.750 align:middle line:84%
already, the commercial
planes and the trails

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and then the red
trails, blue trails,

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.275 align:middle line:84%
pink trails are little
planes, little Gulfstreams,

00:28:00.275 --> 00:28:04.090 align:middle line:84%
little Cesnas, little
Embraers; small business jets.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And all of their
coms are blocked.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:09.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't know who they
are, what's on board,

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:10.660 align:middle line:90%
and where they're going.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.620 align:middle line:90%
They're all blocked.

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So there is a fleet, and
untold fleet up there.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:18.199 align:middle line:84%
These are much, much, much
cheaper planes to fly.

00:28:18.199 --> 00:28:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And they're
undoubtedly nobody on board,

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.380 align:middle line:84%
or very few people,
one or two persons.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.640 align:middle line:84%
There need be no
one else, it's best

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.500 align:middle line:84%
if you have payload
rather than persons.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.000 align:middle line:84%
They're up there
doing this as well.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.400 align:middle line:84%
But they're largely
flying the short trails.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.890 align:middle line:84%
But they're always in
90 degree intercepts.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: 90 degree
interceptions.

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.820 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a
tic-tac-toe board.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And earlier you'd
talked about roll clouds.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And if
you want friction

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.690 align:middle line:84%
at a layer of an atmosphere,
you don't run them

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.709 align:middle line:84%
one layer running
faster than the other.

00:28:50.709 --> 00:28:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Yes, granted you're
going to get that roof.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's called vorticity
in meteorology terms.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.520 align:middle line:90%
It's vorticity.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a twist.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And vorticity is
key, key, key, key.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:01.700 align:middle line:84%
If you've got vorticity, you're
going to get rain or snow.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:06.440 align:middle line:84%
That's just it's ingredient
number one is vorticity.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.330 align:middle line:84%
But if you run one
layer of atmosphere

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:11.435 align:middle line:84%
across another that's going
to get your maximum shear,

00:29:11.435 --> 00:29:15.740 align:middle line:84%
your maximum twisting,
your maximum spin.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And everything in this creation
spirals, everything spirals.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you can enhance the
spiral on top of a life force

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:26.830 align:middle line:84%
that like the worm
is already squirming,

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.580 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get
thunderstorms going up

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.860 align:middle line:90%
like this, up like this.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's much easier
to put down a tornado

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.220 align:middle line:84%
out of a thunderstorm
that's spiraling

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.620 align:middle line:90%
than the one that's bubbling.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Now what about the
interesting-looking changes

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.370 align:middle line:84%
in the chemtrail
formations over the years?

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.340 align:middle line:84%
A few years back it was really
common to see zippered--

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:50.240 align:middle line:90%
kind of a zipper formation.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Other times-- one
thing I notice is

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.330 align:middle line:84%
that you see these
gray lines that are not

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.040 align:middle line:84%
white chemtrail lines, but
they come from above down

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.740 align:middle line:84%
into the earth and they're
usually slightly diagonal.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Shadows.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Shadows.

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Shadows.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're shadows.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:05.030 align:middle line:10%
Well tell us what--

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.670 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: They call
them black trails or--

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:08.470 align:middle line:10%
their shadows.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:09.175 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: They're like a shadow.

00:30:09.175 --> 00:30:10.585 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: It's basic geometry.

00:30:10.585 --> 00:30:11.960 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right,
so what is that?

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.532 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: Sun obscuring
the light path.

00:30:14.532 --> 00:30:16.490 align:middle line:10%
And then if you've got
particulates or humidity

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:18.698 align:middle line:10%
in the atmosphere, then
you're going to get a shadow.

00:30:18.698 --> 00:30:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And in time lapse, if
you've got to GoPro,

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:23.300 align:middle line:84%
or get a time-lapse
app for your phone,

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.860 align:middle line:84%
you can see the shadow
following the trail.

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.280 align:middle line:90%
That aspect is elementary.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.155 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what are
the zippers all about?

00:30:31.155 --> 00:30:32.930 align:middle line:84%
How do you get these
different formations

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:34.220 align:middle line:90%
that these things are laying?

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Because I haven't
seen one and I don't know

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:37.928 align:middle line:84%
exactly what you're
talking about--

00:30:37.928 --> 00:30:40.137 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, over
Sedona for years

00:30:40.137 --> 00:30:42.470 align:middle line:84%
there were ones that were
laid that looked like zippers.

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:45.320 align:middle line:10%
You would have a straight
line with these little bar

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:10%
spikes coming out of
it, like a zipper.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.710 align:middle line:10%
It looked like one
side of a zipper.

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:53.180 align:middle line:10%
And it was very symmetrical.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't look like
just wisps flowing out.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.000 align:middle line:90%
It looked like a zipper.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to ask
you to comment on that.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't do
that were you are I guess.

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:01.091 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I've probably
seen it in a photograph.

00:31:01.091 --> 00:31:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: But the on
and off is for a reason.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.359 align:middle line:90%
And I've truly--

00:31:06.359 --> 00:31:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The on and off?

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.400 align:middle line:90%
I see them do the on and off.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.441 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, I've seen
them change tanks too,

00:31:10.441 --> 00:31:13.190 align:middle line:84%
where they go from the
pinkish-orange trail

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:16.060 align:middle line:84%
to a blue one, literally
like-- no, not quite like that.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.840 align:middle line:90%
It'll sputter off, off, gap.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.690 align:middle line:90%
And then the color will come on.

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
my understanding

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:26.164 align:middle line:84%
at this point, after looking
into this for now 17 years

00:31:26.164 --> 00:31:27.080 align:middle line:90%
I've been watching it.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: You're ahead
of me, not by much though.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, but
you've been doing it

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.050 align:middle line:90%
into more depth than I have.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:34.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm a dilettante.

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:38.390 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, some
of the same questions

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:41.630 align:middle line:84%
keep emerging and
some of the same fears

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:45.710 align:middle line:84%
keep emerging, which is
it's not just aluminum

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:48.380 align:middle line:90%
barium and perhaps strontium.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:50.870 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes there's
this cobwebbing stuff

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:53.240 align:middle line:90%
that falls over everything.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there are
viral agents in it,

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.270 align:middle line:84%
as James Gilliland and Max
the Project Paper-clipper

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:01.280 align:middle line:90%
gathered and analyzed.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And said, well, why do we have
E. coli and tuberculosis coming

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.240 align:middle line:90%
down in these clouds?

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Cancer.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cancer, I
mean, what the heck.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And each region seems to have
its own little experiments that

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.310 align:middle line:84%
are going on at
every given time.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And so that brings me
up to this question.

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Because I tried to
talk to it among people

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.852 align:middle line:84%
in the public, which they do
not acknowledge chemtrails.

00:32:22.852 --> 00:32:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Good
luck with that one.

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:25.309 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's this.

00:32:25.309 --> 00:32:26.870 align:middle line:90%
It's about the tomatoes.

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:30.170 align:middle line:84%
So in California I would
grow a garden each year,

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:33.440 align:middle line:84%
and always had just, I mean,
wheelbarrows full of tomatoes.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:37.130 align:middle line:84%
It was such fertile soil from
the horse dung next door.

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And my brother-in-law
always grew tomatoes.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Another friend of ours
who's an organic gardener

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.730 align:middle line:90%
would grow his tomatoes.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:46.430 align:middle line:84%
We were spotted all over
in the Sacramento area

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:50.300 align:middle line:84%
from the foothills down to
the Sacramento River itself.

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.670 align:middle line:90%
And something started happening.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.130 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago, it didn't
matter where we lived.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.840 align:middle line:84%
All of our tomatoes
were failing.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.410 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't get-- they
didn't look the same.

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:04.060 align:middle line:84%
They'd have white spots
or they weren't producing.

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing I could
finally point to was the sky.

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:09.400 align:middle line:84%
What is the one thing
we all had in common?

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: The sky.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The sky.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: The sky, and so did
you come up with a solution?

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we have not
come up with a solution,

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.050 align:middle line:84%
except that you
can't continuously

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:21.290 align:middle line:84%
block ultraviolet and have
anything that grows decently

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:22.150 align:middle line:90%
on one hand.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: And you need UV.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You have to have UV.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.660 align:middle line:90%
You have to have it.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Plants absolutely need the UV.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Just
like we need CO2.

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in addition
what other constituents might

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:36.930 align:middle line:84%
have been in there that just
simply stopped the maturation

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:37.730 align:middle line:90%
process?

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.860 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't
become rip and full.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.690 align:middle line:90%
And they wouldn't finish.

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So did you all have
the same kind of leaf issues,

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:47.167 align:middle line:90%
leaf disease, or degradation?

00:33:47.167 --> 00:33:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One year we all
had similar leaf issues.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:49.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't recall,
because I didn't really

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.348 align:middle line:90%
ask about it the other years.

00:33:52.348 --> 00:33:53.940 align:middle line:90%
It was more just the--

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.462 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: If it had only
been a paper for school,

00:33:56.462 --> 00:33:58.420 align:middle line:84%
you would all would have
done the science part.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
thing is it was too--

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and then so we start talking
to other growers even.

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And they were having
low yields and such.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And so
they go indoors.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:07.670 align:middle line:90%
They go under canopies.

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:09.378 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
the only way to go.

00:34:09.378 --> 00:34:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I did have a really wonderful
garden in Sedona 15 years ago

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.570 align:middle line:84%
when I was studying
chemtrails too.

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was I
mean had river silt

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:18.889 align:middle line:90%
and organic composts.

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And I grew everything in
my backyard in Sedona,

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean beautiful
things from broccoli

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.370 align:middle line:90%
to peas to lettuces year round.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:28.940 align:middle line:84%
But what I did do is
every day they sprayed,

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:32.750 align:middle line:90%
I put light cloth over it.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So the light could come
through, but the chemicals

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:37.190 align:middle line:90%
couldn't land on them.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Hothouses, it seems
to me with what's

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:41.810 align:middle line:84%
going on hothouses are going
to be the only way to grow.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That would be a
great business to get into.

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:48.199 align:middle line:84%
Because I think we will
realize that the atmosphere is

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:52.100 align:middle line:84%
changing, intentional or not
that we need those hothouses.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Plus you can get a
concentration, a much higher

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.885 align:middle line:90%
CO2 in a hothouse.

00:34:55.885 --> 00:34:57.202 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely CO2.

00:34:57.202 --> 00:34:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I know we need it.

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:00.920 align:middle line:84%
We truly-- the ideal
level for this planet

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.280 align:middle line:90%
is in the 1,500 to 2,000 range.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.996 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That's really
where it needs to be.

00:35:04.996 --> 00:35:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You need it go your
flora, fauna, and your lungs

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:09.440 align:middle line:84%
to operate, the
lungs of the planet.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: If we were
to go back sub 300,

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.210 align:middle line:84%
this planet would be on the
verge of becoming a desert.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Another irony in
the whole carbon tax thing.

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Isn't it though?

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The whole thing
is so crazy and upside down.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no I agree with you.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean I've been
considering that.

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I wouldn't even
try to grow crops right.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:27.560 align:middle line:84%
After all those
tomatoes failed, I

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.452 align:middle line:84%
lost heart in the whole
thing and thought,

00:35:29.452 --> 00:35:30.410 align:middle line:90%
what is happening here.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:31.826 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: What
am I trying to do?

00:35:31.826 --> 00:35:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is like the
breadbasket of California.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.875 align:middle line:84%
Everything grows in
the Central Valley.

00:35:36.875 --> 00:35:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Not to get
too conspiratorial,

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:44.274 align:middle line:84%
but I think there is an
agenda to create famine.

00:35:44.274 --> 00:35:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, you now
this is another subject.

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:48.191 align:middle line:84%
In the film-- it was
either "What in the World,"

00:35:48.191 --> 00:35:49.606 align:middle line:84%
it might have been
the second one.

00:35:49.606 --> 00:35:51.380 align:middle line:84%
"Why in the World
are They Spraying?"

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:53.660 align:middle line:84%
The family in Hawaii, the
organic growers in Hawaii.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It was on that farm.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:54.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was on that farm.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Their crops were way diminished
once they started chemtrailing.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Their child had aluminum
in their hair follicles.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:05.600 align:middle line:10%
Five-year-old little girl
living on an organic farm,

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.970 align:middle line:10%
loads of aluminum,
aluminum barium,

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.640 align:middle line:10%
strontium as constituents
in chemtrails.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.352 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And where
they are, the atmosphere

00:36:13.352 --> 00:36:14.810 align:middle line:84%
that they've been
breathing has had

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:17.540 align:middle line:84%
to go all the way
around the planet once.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Because there's not
much trailing once

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.330 align:middle line:90%
you get west of Hawaii.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:21.230 align:middle line:90%
There just isn't.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:24.100 align:middle line:84%
It's in the further part
of the north jet-stream,

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.580 align:middle line:90%
near the tip of the Aleutians.

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:28.670 align:middle line:84%
But rarely is it over
Russia, over China,

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:30.320 align:middle line:90%
and those points east.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, that's
another interesting point.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:37.990 align:middle line:84%
So Vladimir Putin,
ostensibly we know

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:41.502 align:middle line:84%
he's on the warpath
against Monsanto and GMOs.

00:36:41.502 --> 00:36:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: With reason.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With
reason, absolutely.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: With reason, yeah.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, god.

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:45.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm not criticizing this.

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I know.

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:46.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't the man--

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I believe
that he has stated,

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:49.960 align:middle line:84%
he is not going to
allow-- he does not allow

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.600 align:middle line:90%
chemtrailing over his country.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And he also announced that
it is his goal, stated goal,

00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:00.009 align:middle line:84%
to be the largest exporter of
organic produce in the world.

00:37:00.009 --> 00:37:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: This is what you do.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:04.630 align:middle line:84%
You see your enemies weaknesses
and you exploit them.

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:10.370 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, if he's going
to exploit that way, go for it.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:13.442 align:middle line:84%
I mean at least his own people
are not going to be exposed.

00:37:13.442 --> 00:37:14.650 align:middle line:90%
They might have other issues.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:17.830 align:middle line:84%
But they're not going to be
exposed to toxic food supplies,

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:19.450 align:middle line:90%
as we are in this country.

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, isn't that
interesting to stand up

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:24.662 align:middle line:84%
for the three things that
everyone on this planet

00:37:24.662 --> 00:37:26.370 align:middle line:84%
should be demanding
of their governments.

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's true.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He just
took it to heart.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's true.

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:29.230 align:middle line:90%
It's just basic.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is basic.

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is a huge
political agenda.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.690 align:middle line:90%
Chemtrails are acknowledged.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:35.630 align:middle line:90%
And I've said this.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:37.690 align:middle line:84%
I've said this in the
last show with you.

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:39.940 align:middle line:84%
When I was present when
Dennis Kucinich announced

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:40.740 align:middle line:90%
his Presidency.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:45.767 align:middle line:84%
We were in Civic Center back
in 2001-2, something like that.

00:37:45.767 --> 00:37:48.100 align:middle line:84%
One of the questions, angry
questions from the audience,

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:52.300 align:middle line:84%
was why did you dump the ban on
space-based weapons part that

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.580 align:middle line:90%
said to ban chemtrails?

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if I didn't
drop that, everything

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm working for would be over.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.020 align:middle line:90%
I'd have no effect.

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So he had been
threatened, obviously.

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So we know this is
a real phenomena.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.740 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing what's
happening in our weather.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.630 align:middle line:84%
You and I are in agreement
that this whole story

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:14.230 align:middle line:84%
and political movement, and
newscasts and documentaries

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:16.840 align:middle line:84%
on global climate change
is completely bogus

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.710 align:middle line:84%
if you can't acknowledge weather
modification, geoengineering,

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:22.930 align:middle line:84%
chemtrails, HAARP; whatever
you want to call these things.

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Can you imagine
how litigious things would

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:30.760 align:middle line:84%
get if the people knew what was
happening, how large that class

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.920 align:middle line:90%
action suit would be?

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.900 align:middle line:90%
And who would be the defendants?

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It would be
monumental, because everyone

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:40.170 align:middle line:90%
would have a claim.

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone
would have a claim.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:42.435 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Everyone
would have a claim.

00:38:42.435 --> 00:38:44.090 align:middle line:90%
The damages would be that great.

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
we've already talked

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.630 align:middle line:90%
about some of the solutions.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.690 align:middle line:84%
One solution is grow
your own food out

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:51.490 align:middle line:84%
in a hothouse in
the backyard, or buy

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.520 align:middle line:84%
from companies that are
doing the same, BC hothouse.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.630 align:middle line:10%
I mean the hothouses in BC
do a lot of organic produces,

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.380 align:middle line:10%
and that's simply
because they more needed

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.016 align:middle line:10%
to for weather purposes
through the years.

00:39:02.016 --> 00:39:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So we can look at
our own food supplies

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and not let this
phenomena take us

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.950 align:middle line:84%
down in terms of the
nutritional content in our diet.

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:10.240 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing we can do.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Let your
food be your medicine.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.048 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let your
food be your medicine.

00:39:13.048 --> 00:39:14.620 align:middle line:90%
Do the hands-on on thing.

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:17.500 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the
larger patterns, you

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.801 align:middle line:84%
can move away from
coastal areas.

00:39:19.801 --> 00:39:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Because if they're
going to continue this,

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:24.450 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
continue to be slammed.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:26.207 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:26.207 --> 00:39:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I think until we
deal with the financial system--

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, that's going
to continue because someone

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:31.400 align:middle line:90%
benefits from that.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: There's
always a benefit.

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:33.748 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
what do you have

00:39:33.748 --> 00:39:36.250 align:middle line:84%
in situations like Los
Angeles, in Marin County?

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:41.070 align:middle line:84%
My friend Susan called and
said, it is 113 here today.

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:45.040 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't even that in
Arizona in Sedona this year.

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.380 align:middle line:84%
In Marin, well they don't
have air conditioners

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.570 align:middle line:84%
in San Francisco
in Marin, and even

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:52.120 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles in a
lot of the older homes.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And this again was a front
coming from the east that

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.100 align:middle line:90%
was, quote, "superheating."

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.140 align:middle line:84%
How does that work
and what causes that?

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:06.310 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: It was a very,
very weak Santa Ana.

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:08.560 align:middle line:10%
So we had the marine
layer along the coast,

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.440 align:middle line:10%
keeping those coastal areas
cool as best it could.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.390 align:middle line:10%
But because we had such
a hot high pressure

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:16.792 align:middle line:10%
anchored over Utah,
just over Utah,

00:40:16.792 --> 00:40:19.000 align:middle line:10%
and it extended all the way
up into British Columbia.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And that allowed
fires to begin in June

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and even now in mid-September
they're just now getting

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:28.000 align:middle line:84%
mother nature behind their
back to help put them out.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And so it is that anchored
hot high over Utah,

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:36.775 align:middle line:84%
it is inhibiting that marine
air flow to come on in.

00:40:36.775 --> 00:40:37.970 align:middle line:90%
It will end.

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Because that ridge is breaking
down even as we speak.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And inside of 48 hours
much, much cooler weather

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:45.330 align:middle line:90%
will be over the entire West.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what can
account for 113 in Marin?

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.897 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It's
September, and it happens.

00:40:50.897 --> 00:40:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't
happen like that.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No, no.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.670 align:middle line:90%
102 would be extreme.

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very extreme,
and growing up there,

00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:59.260 align:middle line:84%
we were lucky if we got in
the 90s when I was a kid.

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.320 align:middle line:90%
That was rare.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: 113 is
exceptional, it's

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.350 align:middle line:84%
probably 6 standard deviations
beyond what is normal.

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, so we can
say there is global climate

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.160 align:middle line:90%
change, all right.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.368 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: There's weirdness.

00:41:10.368 --> 00:41:11.710 align:middle line:90%
I call it global weirdness.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can call it
that high strangeness amidst--

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Amongst high crimes.

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.128 align:middle line:84%
Now we want to talk
about something else.

00:41:20.128 --> 00:41:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Because goodness, we've
spent so much time on this.

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Now we're going to talk about--

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.043 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: 4 minutes left?

00:41:24.043 --> 00:41:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, we have
time, 15 minutes or so.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to talk about
also solar eclipses,

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:32.196 align:middle line:84%
and what happens, the effects
of the sun on the atmosphere.

00:41:32.196 --> 00:41:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: You've seen one.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was there for
the big one in '91 in Mexico,

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:38.150 align:middle line:84%
right where it was
at its peak, kind

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:39.590 align:middle line:84%
of like those who
were in Wyoming

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:43.170 align:middle line:90%
were in August of this year.

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very surreal
event, I would say there.

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And on that note, I was
talking to Jaime Maussan

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:57.750 align:middle line:84%
and telling him I had been
there during that event,

00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:58.550 align:middle line:90%
standing there.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:59.884 align:middle line:90%
It looked like a Greek painting.

00:41:59.884 --> 00:42:01.883 align:middle line:84%
We were just stunned, all
standing with our arms

00:42:01.883 --> 00:42:02.730 align:middle line:90%
to our side.

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Kind of spaced out,
not very many people

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.870 align:middle line:84%
on this beach in Cabo
as the sky went dark.

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, well you
know there were many, many UFO

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:14.450 align:middle line:90%
sightings in the trail of it.

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very strange
experience after that

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.120 align:middle line:84%
that I won't talk
about now, a dream

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.670 align:middle line:84%
that happened later
that it showed me

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:22.200 align:middle line:90%
exactly what had happened.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile now we have the
August 17 event right,

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:26.930 align:middle line:90%
solar eclipse here.

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:28.182 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, August 21.

00:42:28.182 --> 00:42:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, August 21, not 17.

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: In '17.

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: August
21, '17 exactly.

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that event, as
that event is occurring,

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:39.390 align:middle line:84%
NASA's announcing
that they're going

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:41.220 align:middle line:84%
to put up all these
balloons covered

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.800 align:middle line:84%
in a particular kind
of bacteria or a virus,

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:46.420 align:middle line:84%
just to see if it's a little
darker in the daytime, what

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:50.200 align:middle line:84%
it would do the virus, so we
can emulate conditions on Mars.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Now that sounded like some
really weird backward thinking

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.280 align:middle line:90%
sci-fi to me.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.460 align:middle line:90%
It didn't even make sense.

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:57.043 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And what
viruses would they

00:42:57.043 --> 00:43:01.090 align:middle line:84%
choose to send up to test,
ones that they already

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:02.952 align:middle line:84%
know were there or ones
they'd want to take?

00:43:02.952 --> 00:43:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I don't know.

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Or just
generic stuff that they're

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:06.722 align:middle line:90%
seeing can survive?

00:43:06.722 --> 00:43:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I don't know.

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.990 align:middle line:84%
But what struck me
was why would they

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:12.696 align:middle line:84%
in any way think because
it darkens a bit that it's

00:43:12.696 --> 00:43:14.820 align:middle line:84%
going to give them the kind
of read they're looking

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:18.570 align:middle line:84%
for as to emulate conditions
on Mars, with a completely

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:20.820 align:middle line:84%
different atmosphere
and everything else?

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:21.760 align:middle line:90%
It didn't make sense.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.210 align:middle line:84%
But it warned the
public 48 hours

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:27.900 align:middle line:84%
in advance, weather
balloons, weather balloons.

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And so then you get
into first of all,

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:32.867 align:middle line:90%
let's look at some video.

00:43:32.867 --> 00:43:34.700 align:middle line:84%
This is a little video
of what was trailing.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And there at least 14
different people that

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:39.750 align:middle line:84%
caught different
events on camera

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:43.470 align:middle line:84%
during the total eclipse
of 1991 in Mexico.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:46.396 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a little look
at that video first, OK?

00:43:46.396 --> 00:43:48.790 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:51.558 align:middle line:10%
>>(ON VIDEO): An executive
with Televisa, Mexico's largest

00:43:51.558 --> 00:43:54.366 align:middle line:10%
television network,
Guillermo Arragin

00:43:54.366 --> 00:43:56.830 align:middle line:10%
was the first to step forward.

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:59.574 align:middle line:10%
He explained that his
location on the roof

00:43:59.574 --> 00:44:02.538 align:middle line:10%
afforded an excellent view
of the dramatic incident.

00:44:02.538 --> 00:44:06.990 align:middle line:90%


00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:10.516 align:middle line:84%
Optical enhancement
of the object he taped

00:44:10.516 --> 00:44:14.398 align:middle line:84%
depicts a metal
disk-shaped craft.

00:44:14.398 --> 00:44:17.180 align:middle line:90%
It is suspended in the air.

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be floating,
perhaps rotating on its axis.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so there's
a little bit from 1991.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And so now we
already have quote--

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:32.230 align:middle line:84%
what seems to me this is from
a completely conspiratorial

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:33.775 align:middle line:90%
viewpoint, mine, right on this--

00:44:33.775 --> 00:44:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I love it.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:35.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I mean I admit that.

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:39.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm admitting it, because
of what happened back then

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:41.830 align:middle line:90%
and the alarm of some people.

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:43.690 align:middle line:84%
In Mexico, they're
not alarmed by UFOs

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:44.920 align:middle line:90%
like we are in this country.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:46.030 align:middle line:90%
We're somehow alarmed.

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.155 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether we
think it's demonic or what.

00:44:48.155 --> 00:44:49.997 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Does it seem
like they get more?

00:44:49.997 --> 00:44:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think they do
have a lot of sightings there.

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:54.538 align:middle line:84%
But the people aren't
particularly alarmed around it.

00:44:54.538 --> 00:44:55.810 align:middle line:90%
It's just part of life.

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:59.650 align:middle line:84%
So now in preparation for
this, NASA is sending up,

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:02.440 align:middle line:84%
quote, "all of these balloons,"
which would obscure that issue

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.256 align:middle line:90%
pretty well, right?

00:45:03.256 --> 00:45:05.130 align:middle line:84%
If you're sending them
up during the eclipse?

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: In that area, yeah.

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And they sent them up
at different locations.

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And so what ended up happening
was a very similar thing

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:14.740 align:middle line:90%
to 1991.

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.510 align:middle line:84%
People are starting
to get videos

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:19.587 align:middle line:84%
as they're watching
this of UFO activity

00:45:19.587 --> 00:45:21.170 align:middle line:84%
in the wake of and
during the eclipse.

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look
at that piece of video.

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.330 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:27.414 align:middle line:10%
>>(ON VIDEO): There's
some lights over there.

00:45:27.414 --> 00:45:28.270 align:middle line:10%
There they are.

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:29.070 align:middle line:10%
I see.

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:30.280 align:middle line:10%
I got them on camera.

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.370 align:middle line:10%
What?

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:32.170 align:middle line:10%
All right.

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:35.080 align:middle line:84%
We have incredible amounts
of videos coming into us

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.820 align:middle line:84%
right here at Third
Phase Moon in regards

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:39.790 align:middle line:84%
to the UFO phenomenon
like we predicted.

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:42.880 align:middle line:84%
The eclipse happened and
the videos are coming in.

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's get to Sigma 7, raw
video coming in, check it out.

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:50.670 align:middle line:90%


00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:52.525 align:middle line:84%
I wish my camera
would zoom in farther.

00:45:52.525 --> 00:45:55.636 align:middle line:90%


00:45:55.636 --> 00:45:58.980 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Holy [MUTED],, never
seen anything like this.

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:07.030 align:middle line:90%


00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:08.016 align:middle line:90%
Oh, god.

00:46:08.016 --> 00:46:10.974 align:middle line:90%


00:46:10.974 --> 00:46:17.980 align:middle line:90%
[GASP] What is that?

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:19.080 align:middle line:90%
There's another one.

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:24.768 align:middle line:90%


00:46:24.768 --> 00:46:25.660 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:26.962 align:middle line:90%
This is really scary.

00:46:26.962 --> 00:46:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK Scott, were those
weather balloons, you think?

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Do you think those
were weather balloons?

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No, no, no.

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, thank you.

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to set
that whole thing up.

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: No, but
see, because if you're

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.640 align:middle line:84%
going to send up
balloons, then you've

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.975 align:middle line:90%
got plausible deniability.

00:46:36.975 --> 00:46:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:40.150 align:middle line:84%
That to me is exactly
what happened.

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: At least
over that little area.

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:46.095 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens for the other
1,800 miles of eclipse track,

00:46:46.095 --> 00:46:47.630 align:middle line:90%
well, good luck with that.

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
go back to the notion

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:55.400 align:middle line:84%
to the power of an
eclipse over this planet,

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:59.450 align:middle line:84%
over things such as weather
patterns, the ionosphere,

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:01.640 align:middle line:90%
and right down to the esoteric.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:05.320 align:middle line:10%
Why would extraterrestrial
civilizations

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:08.260 align:middle line:10%
be interested and really
come in saturated numbers

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:11.540 align:middle line:10%
around solar eclipses
of this nature?

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:12.940 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: So they can be seen.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Because we have a
large contingent

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:18.790 align:middle line:84%
of people with photographic
gear looking at the event.

00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:23.440 align:middle line:84%
That would be I mean
the most obvious reason.

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there was
an energetic shift,

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:31.940 align:middle line:84%
a change that happened on
that day in this country.

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Because I was there.

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:35.440 align:middle line:84%
I was in Wyoming
under the center line.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of
a special event.

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
change in the energy,

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:47.200 align:middle line:84%
almost like you did mushrooms
or something very, very mild,

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.990 align:middle line:84%
a little mild psychedelic
that absolutely was present.

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:52.030 align:middle line:90%
And we all felt it.

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And then it was windy and
got darker and darker,

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.880 align:middle line:90%
and the color of things changed.

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.296 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is
surreal, isn't it?

00:47:58.296 --> 00:47:59.784 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It is
totally surreal.

00:47:59.784 --> 00:48:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And then the traffic
stops, because they

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:03.550 align:middle line:90%
realize they got to stop.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:04.417 align:middle line:90%
And it gets quieter.

00:48:04.417 --> 00:48:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very quiet.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.450 align:middle line:90%
Everything just comes to a halt.

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And then the
cheers go up as it happens.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:10.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.220 align:middle line:90%
It was a special event.

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And the consciousness of the
people that would drive to go

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:19.330 align:middle line:90%
see that, it was good to be in.

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:22.840 align:middle line:84%
It truly was worth the
drive, going and coming back.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I went to Mexico for it back
then and it was truly worth it.

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:29.992 align:middle line:84%
And on a consciousness level,
interestingly, I had a dream.

00:48:29.992 --> 00:48:31.450 align:middle line:84%
I wrote about this
in a little blog

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:33.250 align:middle line:90%
recently about the eclipse.

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:34.360 align:middle line:90%
I had a dream.

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Some years later, I was standing
under the eclipse again.

00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:42.135 align:middle line:84%
And this time as it was
almost to completion,

00:48:42.135 --> 00:48:46.040 align:middle line:84%
or as it was transiting, I saw a
UFO come in in the trail of it,

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.050 align:middle line:90%
in clear view in the dream.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I had a
telepathic communication,

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:54.720 align:middle line:84%
and I knew it was going to come
and park itself over my head.

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.020 align:middle line:90%
And I was very embarrassed.

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.880 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to slowly
turn and go away,

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.590 align:middle line:84%
so no one could
see that happening.

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:03.190 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so I got downloaded
with a massive amount of energy

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:06.670 align:middle line:84%
as this UFO from this eclipse
scenario was over my head.

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And right after that
the message came

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:09.590 align:middle line:90%
to start doing healing again.

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And I started using my
hands for healing again,

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.750 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of events
came up in two weeks that

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:16.737 align:middle line:84%
needed immediate
attention and resolution.

00:49:16.737 --> 00:49:18.820 align:middle line:84%
So boom, the little blue
flames out of my fingers.

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:21.676 align:middle line:84%
I was telling you before
the show that this,

00:49:21.676 --> 00:49:23.110 align:middle line:90%
it was all very real.

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:25.570 align:middle line:84%
There was some kind
of impact during that

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:29.050 align:middle line:84%
and associated with that
that had apparently set

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:33.520 align:middle line:84%
that up in my own field to
be able when the time came

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.790 align:middle line:90%
to just employ the energy.

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I mean
everything is part of truth.

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And each level down has
that principle at play.

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And so those energies we
use, these alignments, just

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:49.450 align:middle line:84%
like our lives are
written in our astrology,

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:53.710 align:middle line:84%
in our palmistry, in the
forehead; it's all there.

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:57.301 align:middle line:84%
It's all a part of your
mission and purpose here.

00:49:57.301 --> 00:49:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
where we start folding

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:04.360 align:middle line:84%
over these events, the lower
thinking, the geopolitics

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.240 align:middle line:84%
that we've already spoken
of, the incredible pain

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and suffering it causes people,
the beauty of the human spirit

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:12.520 align:middle line:84%
to rise up and help
each other; whether it's

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:16.070 align:middle line:84%
to donate through a charity
or get out in a rowboat

00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and help your neighbor out
the second floor or whatever.

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:27.030 align:middle line:84%
These tragic events bring
about a window for some kind

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:29.310 align:middle line:90%
of larger revelation.

00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And you-- we were all
talking off camera

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:35.820 align:middle line:84%
about this too-- and you
have your own viewpoint

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.760 align:middle line:84%
on what it's all about if
you take it to the largest

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:42.120 align:middle line:90%
spiritual viewpoint.

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.820 align:middle line:84%
So share a little bit
about that with us.

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I started with it--

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:49.820 align:middle line:90%
all of these events are grit.

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:50.620 align:middle line:90%
It's grit.

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's grinding
against all of us.

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:53.465 align:middle line:90%
And we can only take--

00:50:53.465 --> 00:50:55.360 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing when
you're walking and you

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:58.090 align:middle line:84%
have a little tiny
pebble in your shoe

00:50:58.090 --> 00:51:02.920 align:middle line:84%
how painful that little pebble
is, that little irritant.

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And yet every event
we go through in life

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:07.330 align:middle line:90%
is a little bit of grit.

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And we're all
going to experience

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:11.450 align:middle line:90%
that pebble in a different way.

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And some of us, it will
blow out of the water.

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.670 align:middle line:90%
We will flip out.

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And we will take those
around us down with us.

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:19.100 align:middle line:90%
And others--

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like those
who loot during event,

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.940 align:middle line:84%
versus those who
assist their neighbor.

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:25.356 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yep,
and then there are

00:51:25.356 --> 00:51:28.210 align:middle line:84%
those who will sit down on the
ground and take off the shoe

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:29.644 align:middle line:90%
and get rid of it.

00:51:29.644 --> 00:51:31.310 align:middle line:84%
They will go, what
is this bothering me?

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:34.960 align:middle line:84%
They go to the point
right away and remedy it.

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll say, hey, I
see you limping over there.

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:38.140 align:middle line:90%
Come here.

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:39.910 align:middle line:90%
I know what's going on.

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
people that help others

00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:43.480 align:middle line:84%
through these
situations, because they

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:44.920 align:middle line:90%
can identify the problem.

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.870 align:middle line:90%
They know what it is.

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And they can express
the solution.

00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So this is the beauty of why
this planet, this creation,

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.290 align:middle line:90%
is set up the way it is.

00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:57.890 align:middle line:84%
As we were talking
about earlier,

00:51:57.890 --> 00:52:01.230 align:middle line:84%
it's pain that we
learned through.

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:03.280 align:middle line:90%
Ease and bliss, yes.

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.730 align:middle line:90%
That's a wonderful thing.

00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:06.280 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the three gunas.

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.100 align:middle line:84%
There's inaction,
there's sattva,

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.360 align:middle line:90%
and then there's movement.

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And usually we're just
swinging back and forth,

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.800 align:middle line:84%
and thinking we're
going through all

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.466 align:middle line:84%
of this great progress,
where we're just

00:52:16.466 --> 00:52:18.580 align:middle line:84%
like the like the
grandfather clock who's

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:20.410 align:middle line:84%
gotten old swinging
back and forth

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:21.660 align:middle line:90%
in the corner of the room.

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:24.084 align:middle line:84%
And even though,
well, we were supposed

00:52:24.084 --> 00:52:25.840 align:middle line:84%
to have a conversation
about the weather.

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: We're going to
trek off into this regardless.

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:29.653 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like I
said, for everywhere,

00:52:29.653 --> 00:52:32.200 align:middle line:90%
we'll just go for it.

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.240 align:middle line:84%
That's my observation
and I happen

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:37.090 align:middle line:84%
to agree with that
in that we all

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:40.000 align:middle line:84%
know the startling
events in our life

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.540 align:middle line:84%
that force change, forced
us through and into change.

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And I see it almost
on a material level

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:51.760 align:middle line:84%
in that the kind of gross
or more painful dense events

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:57.340 align:middle line:84%
that happen have a kind of dense
energy, material energy to them

00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:00.310 align:middle line:84%
that really can suck you down,
hold you in those patterns,

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:01.931 align:middle line:90%
and create inertia.

00:53:01.931 --> 00:53:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It does not
want to let you go.

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't
want to let you go.

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:05.563 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No, it doesn't.

00:53:05.563 --> 00:53:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And at the same time
these blissful ephemeral events

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:11.580 align:middle line:84%
are of such a light nature,
such a light frequency

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:14.800 align:middle line:84%
as to have virtually no
material content to them at all,

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:18.680 align:middle line:84%
other than this feeling that's
experienced during them.

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:19.600 align:middle line:90%
And then it goes.

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:20.474 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's gone.

00:53:20.474 --> 00:53:21.860 align:middle line:90%
And then you're back in this.

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And so it's how do you
magnetize people to something so

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:28.930 align:middle line:90%
ephemeral, to draw it forward?

00:53:28.930 --> 00:53:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Like that was so
beautiful, I want more,

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:34.240 align:middle line:84%
and you just follow that
path of bliss, versus

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:37.600 align:middle line:84%
have a person kind of get
kicked in the butt with one

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:40.452 align:middle line:84%
thing or another in life,
to spur that growth.

00:53:40.452 --> 00:53:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So now let's take it
back to the weather.

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's take it back.

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that this
is the death knell

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:48.670 align:middle line:90%
of the age of fossil fuels.

00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Hallelujah.

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're coming toward an
end of an age, thanks to people

00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:54.040 align:middle line:90%
also like Elon Musk.

00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:57.640 align:middle line:90%


00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.380 align:middle line:84%
There are great
entities on this planet

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:01.870 align:middle line:84%
that are forcing that
change that are enticing us

00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:03.340 align:middle line:90%
into that change.

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:06.860 align:middle line:84%
How do you view that on a
large psycho-spiritual level?

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I had this
discussion not that long ago.

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was a
radio show I was on.

00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And I came to the
realization that there

00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:16.780 align:middle line:84%
is a reason that Tesla's
technology didn't get out

00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:18.310 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:21.471 align:middle line:84%
And the primary reason was
we weren't ready for it.

00:54:21.471 --> 00:54:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We weren't
in enough pain.

00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: We were not mature
enough, restrained enough,

00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:31.510 align:middle line:84%
giving enough, caring
enough, compassionate enough

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:33.190 align:middle line:90%
that we had to be held back.

00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:36.610 align:middle line:84%
If we had a limitless
fuel tank, oh my goodness,

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:38.530 align:middle line:84%
where were we going
to go with this?

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:39.802 align:middle line:90%
We got to run out of gas.

00:54:39.802 --> 00:54:41.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like us at
the end of the day.

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:42.970 align:middle line:90%
We have to go to sleep.

00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:45.490 align:middle line:90%
And that stops that momentum.

00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:47.020 align:middle line:90%
That stops that day.

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:50.310 align:middle line:84%
The drunk goes home
angry, and thank goodness

00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:53.794 align:middle line:84%
at some point or
another he passes out.

00:54:53.794 --> 00:54:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Sweet relief!

00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:58.960 align:middle line:84%
But now as consciousness
moves forward,

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and we have very, very special
children being born now,

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:07.160 align:middle line:84%
old, old souls
ready to contribute.

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And we have nearly a whole
generation that is lost.

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:12.460 align:middle line:84%
They're happier playing
games rather than

00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:14.720 align:middle line:90%
going doing meaningless work.

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:17.189 align:middle line:84%
And so their purpose is
about to show up as well.

00:55:17.189 --> 00:55:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
they're just entering

00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:21.010 align:middle line:84%
the age where they can take
action and have some power

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:21.540 align:middle line:90%
and say.

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: They're
living in their mom's

00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:24.100 align:middle line:90%
and grandma's basements.

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Playing video games.

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yes, they don't want
to be a part of this world.

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:29.490 align:middle line:90%
It's hell out there.

00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
true all over the world.

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yes.

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I think there's some kind
of big change is going to come

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:40.070 align:middle line:84%
and the economic reset is
going to precipitate that.

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And that will free
the inventors to come out

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:45.170 align:middle line:90%
of the garages.

00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And the Elon Musks
to say, yes, AI is a problem.

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:51.700 align:middle line:84%
We've had a car
that you buy once

00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and you never have
to pay for again.

00:55:53.590 --> 00:55:55.820 align:middle line:84%
We charge it once,
and it's done.

00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:58.120 align:middle line:10%
We've already got a company,
Brilliant Light Power

00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:04.240 align:middle line:10%
in California who in water runs
a 12,000 amp arc of electricity

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.330 align:middle line:10%
across a little
strand of silver.

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And it creates this
brilliant light,

00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:13.270 align:middle line:84%
a million volts of power, a
very, very narrow frequency

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:14.330 align:middle line:90%
of light.

00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So now the process is to
perfect the photovoltaics

00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:20.530 align:middle line:90%
to turn this light into power.

00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:22.840 align:middle line:84%
So they're leasing these
units that are small,

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:26.082 align:middle line:84%
half the size of this table,
to irrigation farmers.

00:56:26.082 --> 00:56:27.040 align:middle line:90%
They're licensing them.

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.000 align:middle line:90%
They can't sell them.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.260 align:middle line:84%
They're not comfortable
selling them.

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:30.218 align:middle line:90%
They're licensing them.

00:56:30.218 --> 00:56:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So the farmers can pay
$0.2 a kilowatt hour.

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:36.760 align:middle line:84%
So the power of
one gallon of water

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:40.190 align:middle line:84%
equal to 100 plus
gallons of gasoline.

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden
that same gas tank

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:50.660 align:middle line:84%
water, tank in your 20 gallon
car, has a 20,000 mile range.

00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So these
technologies are nearly here.

00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
they're nearly here.

00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And in many
ways they are here.

00:56:57.430 --> 00:57:02.690 align:middle line:84%
It's just we have this tamas,
this inertia, that's in place.

00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and it's
always been that way.

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:08.810 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of quotes and
sayings about the way progress

00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:11.390 align:middle line:84%
happens is when the
previous generation that's

00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:12.800 align:middle line:90%
locking it in place dies.

00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: One death at a time.

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One death at a time.

00:57:14.850 --> 00:57:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And so in a sense, we're
looking at that on one level.

00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Not to
celebrate death.

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But on another--

00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:19.610 align:middle line:90%
not to celebrate death.

00:57:19.610 --> 00:57:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Because
there's always a birth.

00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:23.706 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is the other has
already been given birth to.

00:57:23.706 --> 00:57:26.067 align:middle line:84%
It's just waiting to have the
veil pulled back so it can

00:57:26.067 --> 00:57:27.275 align:middle line:90%
be acknowledged and utilized.

00:57:27.275 --> 00:57:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, and maybe
the umbilical cord truly cut.

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:35.840 align:middle line:84%
So it can be on its
own and participating.

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:37.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just still tethered
to their inventors,

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:41.120 align:middle line:84%
because they're not comfortable
giving it to the world for fear

00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:42.500 align:middle line:90%
of their own repercussions.

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:44.647 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, they die.

00:57:44.647 --> 00:57:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's not right.

00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:46.805 align:middle line:90%
It's not right.

00:57:46.805 --> 00:57:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that
said, the point

00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:50.750 align:middle line:84%
is all these beautiful
things are already

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:53.060 align:middle line:84%
either fully developed
or certainly many, many

00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:56.150 align:middle line:84%
in the process of development
that will come to fruition

00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and change the economic
structure of the planet.

00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:59.270 align:middle line:90%
And I'm with you.

00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm not waiting for
some Iraqi dinar reset.

00:58:03.110 --> 00:58:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Bitcoin, baby.

00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When
we're talking reset,

00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:09.110 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
on many, many levels.

00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:12.320 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
internally and externally.

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: My partner has
always had the gift of sight.

00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:20.960 align:middle line:10%
And one of his
recent experiences

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:26.360 align:middle line:10%
was literally columns, columns
representing the old system

00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:28.370 align:middle line:10%
crumbling from the top,
not from the bottom,

00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:30.110 align:middle line:10%
but from the top down, top down.

00:58:30.110 --> 00:58:33.770 align:middle line:10%
And in this rubble
was our local bank,

00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:36.440 align:middle line:10%
out local bank buried,
and the President

00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:38.690 align:middle line:10%
of that bank needing help.

00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:39.980 align:middle line:90%
She needed help.

00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:42.500 align:middle line:90%
So she had to go be rescued.

00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:44.360 align:middle line:10%
But as the rubble
was being cleared

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:48.560 align:middle line:10%
from this crash, this collapse,
literally a being standing,

00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:51.600 align:middle line:10%
arms open.

00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:53.279 align:middle line:90%
So there is a second coming.

00:58:53.279 --> 00:58:54.195 align:middle line:90%
There is an awakening.

00:58:54.195 --> 00:58:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think many people
that are watching this already

00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:57.220 align:middle line:90%
feel that.

00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:59.630 align:middle line:90%
They're being motivated by it.

00:58:59.630 --> 00:59:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And we just have to have
some compassion for the death

00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:04.190 align:middle line:90%
knells of this whole way.

00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:05.340 align:middle line:90%
And it is dying.

00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:07.520 align:middle line:90%
So OK.

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.570 align:middle line:90%
Again, thanks Scott.

00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:10.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm hopeful, in the
end I'm hopeful.

00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Me too.

00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:15.710 align:middle line:84%
I know that beautiful things
are just around the corner.

00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:19.274 align:middle line:84%
So next time we'll get back
to cryptocurrencies again.

00:59:19.274 --> 00:59:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Absolutely.

00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:22.273 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As before, you
can go to Scott's website

00:59:22.273 --> 00:59:23.631 align:middle line:90%
at weatherwars.info.

00:59:23.631 --> 00:59:25.880 align:middle line:10%
You might also enjoy my
previous interviews with Scott

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.254 align:middle line:10%
here in the Gaia archives,
where we did talk a little bit

00:59:28.254 --> 00:59:29.610 align:middle line:10%
about cryptocurrencies.

00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us on "Open Minds."
