00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:17.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Every
one of us is aware by now

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.770 align:middle line:10%
that there is an
invisible structure,

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.750 align:middle line:10%
a blueprint to all that
we see and interact with.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.350 align:middle line:10%
This field of intelligence
creates a type of balance

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.670 align:middle line:10%
that keeps our material
world in order.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.400 align:middle line:84%
This was well known
by the ancients,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.460 align:middle line:84%
but this story has been obscured
by modern academia and religion.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ibrahim Karim
is going to bring

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.860 align:middle line:84%
the magic of this
realm and the threats

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.320 align:middle line:84%
to it that are undermining it
into full view with us today,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and we're going on a wild ride,
I'm telling you right now.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.450 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM:
Thank you, Regina.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's
lovely having you.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: I'm very happy
to be with you here.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've been
talking off camera,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and my head is about
to explode, OK?

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:84%
So I have to lay
that out right now.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm trying
to do is you live

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:84%
in a dimensional world that is
full of resonance and geometry.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And you are seeing
the blueprint to life.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.340 align:middle line:90%
You lived there.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
take your brain

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and force you to
reduce it into a realm

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.130 align:middle line:84%
that we can understand
ourselves, our home

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.680 align:middle line:84%
life, our families, why we go
to sacred sites on vacation.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'm asking you,
bear with me while I

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.110 align:middle line:84%
keep trying to bring you into
what I think some of the viewers

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.920 align:middle line:84%
might be intensely
curious about.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: My wife is doing that
all the time with me, you know?

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm sure she is.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Tried to
bring me down here.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try to
keep you grounded.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:84%
So just give us an explanation
in your mind what you're seeing.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.810 align:middle line:84%
What you see when you look
at life in terms of geometry.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to take it
down to autism and linearness,

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.020 align:middle line:84%
corners, domes, round
spaces, sacred architecture,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.060 align:middle line:84%
But how do you see the
world walking around?

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:10%
>>KARIM: Well, I see
the unity of creation

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.750 align:middle line:10%
as a resonating,
multidimensional system.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.910 align:middle line:10%
Now this unity of
creation, in the beginning,

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.430 align:middle line:10%
I thought if it's resonating,
then it cannot be bound to what

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.000 align:middle line:10%
we know about resonance
frequency because all that is

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.210 align:middle line:10%
mathematically broken down and
all that into octaves and then

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.680 align:middle line:10%
minor things and all that.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.730 align:middle line:10%
I thought there must be
a seamless information

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:10%
exchange in the whole universe.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So I found something else, and
that's the resonance of shape.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.190 align:middle line:84%
It seamlessly connects
everything from zero

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:90%
to infinity.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden
now, to me, the moment

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.320 align:middle line:84%
you concentrate on shape,
you're into right brained,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.332 align:middle line:90%
multidimensional perception.

00:02:34.332 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's our gateway
is geometry and shape.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.708 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: If you just look at the
shape of something, of this cup,

00:02:39.708 --> 00:02:42.430 align:middle line:84%
the moment you see the beauty
of the shape of this cup,

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:84%
you're already in this
multidimensional--

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Reality, really.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yeah.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.990 align:middle line:84%
But information exchanging,
it's a multidimensional unity

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
why when people

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.400 align:middle line:84%
look at their mandalas
or their Sri Yantras

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.530 align:middle line:84%
with this beautiful
geometry, they'll

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.150 align:middle line:84%
find they're maybe very, very
drawn to one but not another.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they like the
pyramidal or diamond shapes,

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.330 align:middle line:84%
and another person really just
likes the circular shapes.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Do we just follow our
instincts with what shapes

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.220 align:middle line:90%
we want to engage with then?

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Well, usually,
shapes are qualities.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.995 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
prism, a glass prism

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.370 align:middle line:84%
like that, light
goes through it.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:90%
You get colors.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Now colors are a
result of angles.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:84%
That means angles are qualities
because colors are qualities.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:90%
And shapes are angles actually.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Angles are the
component of shape.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.280 align:middle line:84%
So all shapes are
frozen qualities.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.050 align:middle line:84%
So you have all the qualities of
the universe translated to you

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:90%
as shapes.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when we're
looking at these sacred pieces

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:84%
of artwork or
paintings, we're really

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:84%
doing it because we want to
move into an understanding

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.410 align:middle line:84%
or an experience in a
multidimensional reality.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yes.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:84%
It all pulls you,
any shape, which

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.790 align:middle line:84%
pulls you into
multidimensionality

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.520 align:middle line:84%
because in the background,
it is in resonance

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:84%
with all similar shapes, in
all dimensions of creation.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Shapes do not
exist individually.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Imagine shapes from the
smallest to the largest.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.060 align:middle line:84%
It exists in an
intercommunicative system

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.500 align:middle line:90%
but a unified one.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But maybe even
embedded within each other or

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.550 align:middle line:90%
morphing from one to another?

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Well, they all
somehow, all shapes somehow

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.690 align:middle line:84%
come out of a vortex because
the archetypal dimension,

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and that's the first
dimension before duality.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Because when duality is
created, it cannot be created

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.180 align:middle line:90%
haphazardly.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:84%
It has to be created with
laws and archetypal dimension.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And this archetypal
dimension, this

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.410 align:middle line:84%
is what we call the primordial
ocean between divinity

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.610 align:middle line:90%
and duality.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.850 align:middle line:84%
In this ocean, you
have all the archetypes

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.110 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, time,
and shape, and all that.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Now from there, the archetypes
come down in a sort of a vortex.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.620 align:middle line:84%
A vortex means you get a center,
a multidimensional center.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
is the center of everything,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:84%
of all shape is actually coming
from the heart dimension, that

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.340 align:middle line:84%
means where zero is
equal to infinity.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.220 align:middle line:90%
That's before time and space.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.150 align:middle line:84%
But then the center expands,
and creation happens within it

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.040 align:middle line:90%
because everything is pulsating.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.960 align:middle line:90%
So the pulse expands.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:84%
In it, you have duality
and then comes down.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:84%
But then that means the
center and the container

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.340 align:middle line:90%
are nothing and everything.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:90%
So from there--

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:84%
All right, now that's a
little abstract and wonderful.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.218 align:middle line:84%
But now what we'll do is we'll
start taking these shapes

00:06:03.218 --> 00:06:05.260 align:middle line:84%
very specifically because
you were talking about,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.885 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit
ago before we started

00:06:06.885 --> 00:06:13.140 align:middle line:84%
rolling camera, about autism,
for example, and angles.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: We have done a
lot of research on autism.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm a professor of
architecture, and I

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.420 align:middle line:84%
supervise doctor's degrees
and PhDs for the past 25 years

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:90%
or more than that.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.930 align:middle line:84%
BioGeometry is 50 years
old now, PhDs and all that.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Lots of those PhDs have to
be in the relationship of how

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.672 align:middle line:84%
to use shapes, to harmonize
let's say depression, autism,

00:06:40.672 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and things like
that through shape.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.144 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:42.144 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:90%
And we want to hear shapes.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Now how--

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:84%
In the research for autism,
I'm doing a big project

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.860 align:middle line:90%
for special abilities in Egypt.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I started researching
when I put a child in a square

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:84%
room, when you have an
angle, a 90-degree angle,

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.520 align:middle line:84%
whether you're on that
side or on the other side,

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.860 align:middle line:90%
it creates tension in the brain.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Now this is not just
for the autistic brain.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.970 align:middle line:90%
It does that on any human being.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Explain why a corner creates
tension because this,

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm really into
this, by the way.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
go somewhere from there.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: A corner
creates tension.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.750 align:middle line:84%
If you stand in the
corner, there is tension.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Or on the other side
in front of a corner,

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:84%
it creates tension in
a certain distance.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.280 align:middle line:84%
But let's say you're
standing away.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And you look at
that spot, you still

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.290 align:middle line:84%
get the tension
because of resonance.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why does a right
angle create tension?

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Somehow, this had to
do with the quality of energy,

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:90%
quality of angles.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So the quality of
angle in a corner,

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.880 align:middle line:84%
it has a very
strong carrier wave.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.780 align:middle line:84%
You can use it to send
information in places

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:03.670 align:middle line:84%
to right angles or like that,
like a shooting arrow aspect.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:84%
You know that in
Chinese, we are thinking

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.660 align:middle line:84%
they call it shooting arrow
because the energy comes out

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.827 align:middle line:90%
like coming out of an arrow.

00:08:11.827 --> 00:08:12.868 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Out of the tip.

00:08:12.868 --> 00:08:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: It's a carrier wave.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.512 align:middle line:84%
You can put information
on it and send it.

00:08:16.512 --> 00:08:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So why would
being the presence

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.270 align:middle line:84%
of this angle with
the carrier wave

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:90%
create tension in our psyche.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Because it's strong.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.540 align:middle line:90%
It hits you.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.710 align:middle line:84%
If it's well-balanced, you
see, then it won't create it.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I always
thought maybe it's

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.909 align:middle line:84%
almost like information
or energy gets

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:36.659 align:middle line:90%
trapped in right angles.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:40.190 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have anywhere
to flow or move from.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: In a way.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.962 align:middle line:84%
You see, it's not trapped,
but it's concentrated.

00:08:44.962 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Concentrated.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Concentrated
and then shot out.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So this causes
tension in the brain.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.640 align:middle line:90%
But there are ways of designing.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes, those angles.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.750 align:middle line:84%
For example, you
can put a quarter

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.688 align:middle line:84%
of a circle in the angle, and
then there's no problem at all.

00:09:04.688 --> 00:09:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's go
to that because then you

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.022 align:middle line:84%
know this because you were
trained in the German school

00:09:09.022 --> 00:09:09.822 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:09:09.822 --> 00:09:11.114 align:middle line:90%
You're aware of Rudolf Steiner.

00:09:11.114 --> 00:09:11.914 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yes.

00:09:11.914 --> 00:09:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one of the things
in that system of education

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.940 align:middle line:84%
is you don't expose young
children until the age of 8

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.100 align:middle line:84%
or 9, as I recall,
by having them work

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.670 align:middle line:90%
on a square piece of paper.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.040 align:middle line:90%
No right angles.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:24.920 align:middle line:90%
They're all round.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:90%
The pages are all rounded.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.930 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what happens since when

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.700 align:middle line:84%
you round the angles in a
room or on a piece of paper,

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.500 align:middle line:90%
painting.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.708 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: I'll tell you
something which is surprising.

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Now we tested all
rectangular shapes,

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.110 align:middle line:84%
and they produce
stress on the brain.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So we tested round shapes
and put the autistic children

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.840 align:middle line:90%
in round shapes.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.050 align:middle line:84%
They created tension
in the brain too.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:53.145 align:middle line:84%
So here we have,
this doesn't work.

00:09:53.145 --> 00:09:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Round shapes
created tension.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Round
shapes created that.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So round shapes have to be
also, they have to be corrected.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So I tried to find
which is the ideal angle

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.228 align:middle line:90%
for the autistic brain.

00:10:07.228 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And what is it?

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: I wanted to get the
autistic child all of a sudden

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle line:84%
to open up his tension
and see the world the way

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.470 align:middle line:84%
we see it, at least
with an angle.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.970 align:middle line:84%
People didn't believe that
you could just put an angle

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.430 align:middle line:90%
and change his perceptions.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And we found that
in by geometry,

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:32.120 align:middle line:84%
we had patented a shape many
years ago that has to do,

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.060 align:middle line:90%
it's 135 degrees.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:41.510 align:middle line:84%
So when you make a
shape of 135 degrees,

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.190 align:middle line:84%
let's say the angle
of an octagon.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
going to ask you,

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.290 align:middle line:90%
you were talking octagonal.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yeah.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.960 align:middle line:90%
The angle of an octagon.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.700 align:middle line:84%
This is the one that puts
most relaxation in the mind

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.260 align:middle line:84%
of an autistic child
and in a human being.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, because
a lot of the sacred,

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.680 align:middle line:84%
like in little temples
and such historically

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.650 align:middle line:84%
have at that center part,
it's octagonal often times.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yeah.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Even the domes.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.060 align:middle line:84%
In the domes, when
they come down,

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.938 align:middle line:84%
you will find that they end
up octagonal, square, and all

00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:14.730 align:middle line:84%
that before they end
up in the last shapes.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was like
the last house I lived in.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.600 align:middle line:90%
Everyone loved being in there.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yeah.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:24.710 align:middle line:84%
You find that they are corrected
through this transitional shape

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:25.830 align:middle line:90%
of octagon.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So the octagon is the
transitional shape

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.030 align:middle line:84%
between the square
and the circle.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And it is the most,
let's say, relaxing

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:90%
shape for the autistic brain.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.700 align:middle line:84%
But we are all
somehow not normal.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.500 align:middle line:90%
Who says--

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're just a more
exaggerated version of tension

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.857 align:middle line:90%
to what we are.

00:11:45.857 --> 00:11:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: I don't see
any of us being normal,

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.790 align:middle line:84%
so we all enjoy being
in an octagonal shape.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:54.380 align:middle line:84%
What I did was I designed
the project in Egypt

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.760 align:middle line:90%
based on those shapes.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.460 align:middle line:84%
But you know, to have
the government understand

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.280 align:middle line:84%
what I'm doing because my
geometry seems to many people

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.050 align:middle line:84%
to be a bit strange, I
built an octagonal shape,

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and the roof was sort
of going around up

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.790 align:middle line:84%
like this in a sort of
dome-like structure like this

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:14.990 align:middle line:90%
with octagons.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And I told the
centers for autism

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.920 align:middle line:84%
to bring the children with the
doctors and the supervisors,

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and put them in there,
and let them play in there

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:26.550 align:middle line:90%
and see what happens.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I said the proof in
the cake is in eating it.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.650 align:middle line:90%
And they brought them there.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.983 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you
stories that are endless.

00:12:34.983 --> 00:12:35.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us one.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Just give us an anecdote of
what happened to even one.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Well, I'll give
you two opposite ones.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.410 align:middle line:84%
A child who was hyperactive,
and the instructor

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.880 align:middle line:84%
was holding this little
boy from the hand.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.810 align:middle line:90%
I said, why hold him?

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:49.610 align:middle line:90%
Let him play.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:52.350 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, if I leave
him, he's going to run.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:53.840 align:middle line:90%
We won't be able to catch him.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And before we go to the ship,
the child pulls his hand away,

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:84%
keeps running around and
around, and they run after.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.860 align:middle line:90%
And then they catch him.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.320 align:middle line:84%
They bring him into
the octagonal shape

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.620 align:middle line:90%
to sit to the others.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.540 align:middle line:90%
And then there are cubes there.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So he looks at the cubes, and he
starts playing with the cubes.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And then after 10 minutes,
he smiles and is happy

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.280 align:middle line:84%
and then goes to one
of the instructors,

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.020 align:middle line:90%
and he sleeps on her lap.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:23.918 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Amazing.

00:13:23.918 --> 00:13:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: And he's asleep.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Another child who
is autistic and has

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.130 align:middle line:84%
all those tensions and
those cramps and all you

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:31.630 align:middle line:90%
see with autistic children.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:90%
He goes in there.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And after 10 minutes,
he starts being normal.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:38.870 align:middle line:90%
And he looks at people.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:84%
He sees the world
without tension.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.600 align:middle line:90%
He's very happy there.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.430 align:middle line:90%
And then he manages.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.290 align:middle line:84%
There's no spastic
movements and things.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.030 align:middle line:90%
They all sort of move away.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Now the mothers told
us that after being

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.040 align:middle line:84%
1.5 hours in the
shape, he went home,

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:90%
and he was normal for 24 hours.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
asked me if it's

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.980 align:middle line:84%
possible to design a mini
shape that they could hang up

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:84%
in the room of an
autistic child.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.638 align:middle line:90%
And you.

00:14:10.638 --> 00:14:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: I designed this shape.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:12.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.670 align:middle line:84%
We didn't put it
into production yet,

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:20.380 align:middle line:84%
but we did a lot of testing
with it because if people

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.060 align:middle line:84%
put a lamp inside it or
something like that and use it.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.880 align:middle line:84%
So we have to do
a lot of testing.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.990 align:middle line:90%
But we have those shapes.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:90%
We design now carpets, textiles.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:36.020 align:middle line:84%
All our products in BioGeometry
now, they have one standard,

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.345 align:middle line:84%
and they have to balance the
mind of an autistic child.

00:14:39.345 --> 00:14:40.145 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:40.145 --> 00:14:41.580 align:middle line:90%
So let me ask you this.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's say a person takes
their autistic child home who

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:48.920 align:middle line:84%
lives in a square room, say
a 12 by 12-foot square room,

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:56.270 align:middle line:84%
can't you place, for example,
stones into an octagonal

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.350 align:middle line:90%
pattern?

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And can that be set
up where they just

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.380 align:middle line:90%
communicate and create?

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:01.297 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: It will help.

00:15:01.297 --> 00:15:03.290 align:middle line:90%
It will help if you put--

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:07.340 align:middle line:84%
you see, you can put things
in the corner one way.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Just putting anything
in the corner,

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.040 align:middle line:90%
so it will break the corner.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.760 align:middle line:84%
The child will feel a
bit better in there.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.980 align:middle line:84%
But when we do
BioGeometry designs,

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.380 align:middle line:90%
we go, of course, much deeper.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.580 align:middle line:84%
We have courses teaching people
the principles of BioGeometry

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.550 align:middle line:90%
design and all that.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just an
octagon because an octagon

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.560 align:middle line:84%
is a fairly stable
shape like that.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.360 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.360 align:middle line:84%
We put some dynamic
action into it.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, like you have
the teepees of the Indians.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.120 align:middle line:90%
Many of them are octagonal.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:84%
But the way those
poles come up together,

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.510 align:middle line:84%
they create a sort
of rotation a bit.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.820 align:middle line:84%
They're slightly,
like they're twisting.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: So you can't say
that the teepee is an octagon.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:15:59.210 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.705 align:middle line:90%
It is actually creating--

00:16:00.705 --> 00:16:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A movement,
an octagon in movement.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yeah.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:07.185 align:middle line:84%
And this movement sort of clears
your brain, and your energy,

00:16:07.185 --> 00:16:08.060 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.890 align:middle line:84%
So while we're on
this roll then,

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:12.050 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people
watching this right now

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.760 align:middle line:84%
are very connected to
having personal pyramids,

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.160 align:middle line:90%
going to the pyramids.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And your background,
of course, is Egyptian.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.810 align:middle line:84%
You understand the nature
of these pyramids well.

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
happens when you go into

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.410 align:middle line:84%
or when you sit-in front
of a pyramidal structure

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and what that
should be used for.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Well, let's start,
what's a pyramidal structure?

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:84%
A pyramidal structure
is the last stage

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:41.852 align:middle line:84%
of how humanity interacted
with sacred power spots.

00:16:41.852 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sacred power spots.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:43.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Sacred power spots.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.220 align:middle line:84%
At the dawn of
humanity, they used

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.800 align:middle line:84%
to watch animals go
to sacred power spots

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.290 align:middle line:84%
because they had sacred
springs or water.

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.850 align:middle line:90%
So humans used to go there.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And then they start
in the beginning

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.840 align:middle line:84%
of feeling this energy because
they were more right-brained,

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.050 align:middle line:90%
like animals and all that.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So they saw the
light in those areas.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:07.593 align:middle line:84%
And then what they did,
they brought huge granite--

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, stones.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Stones.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Because granite has
quartz crystals.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And they would radiate the
energy of the sacred power spots

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.520 align:middle line:90%
to larger areas.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.460 align:middle line:84%
So the whole community
living around it

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.500 align:middle line:90%
would benefit from this energy.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.109 align:middle line:84%
And then they found
also that if they

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:27.960 align:middle line:84%
pointed at it from a distance,
somehow they got the light.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.790 align:middle line:84%
So rituals were developed in
relation to sacred power spots.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Now the second thing they did,
which shows a lot of knowledge,

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:44.730 align:middle line:84%
they erected two megalithic
stones and one across.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:90%
Imagine each one is 40 tons.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.120 align:middle line:90%
So they did that.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is they
always pointed the opening

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.420 align:middle line:90%
to the equinoxes, east-west.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Now I want
to measure why that?

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.150 align:middle line:84%
I found when you take two
shapes and you point them

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.830 align:middle line:84%
in this direction,
all of a sudden,

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:middle line:84%
the sacred energy
of the power spots

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:13.070 align:middle line:84%
shoots all the way to both
equinoxes, to the east and west.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:17.050 align:middle line:84%
That means it then connects
to the cycle of life.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:20.450 align:middle line:84%
So you're connecting the sacred
power spot to the cycle of life

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:25.190 align:middle line:84%
through a gateway that
we call now the dolmen.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Then they came later and
put on it, they put earth.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:34.120 align:middle line:84%
So it became a
chamber in a mound.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.730 align:middle line:90%
So that is the sacred mound.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.647 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
what most people watching

00:18:37.647 --> 00:18:41.370 align:middle line:84%
this know of dolmens, are these
sacred domes around the world.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.618 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Well, first, now
it's just an earth mound.

00:18:43.618 --> 00:18:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, an earth mound.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: And then later on,
the mound becomes a pyramid.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And so the pyramid is
actually, the chamber in there

00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:00.620 align:middle line:84%
is a dolmen connecting
the cycle of life

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.610 align:middle line:84%
and basically connecting
with the life force

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:84%
because the sacred
power spot is results

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:84%
from an intersection of two,
let's say, underwater currents,

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.560 align:middle line:90%
but not any water.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Water moving in the rocks.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a very special kind of
water that moves in the rocks.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And when they cross,
they create a vortex.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Now when they
create this vortex,

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.710 align:middle line:90%
what happens with this water?

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:37.140 align:middle line:84%
It connects physical
water through resonance

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.950 align:middle line:84%
to the primordial ocean or
the primordial dimension.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.950 align:middle line:84%
So you get a sacred
power spot that

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:51.040 align:middle line:84%
takes you multidimensionally
up even beyond duality.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
happens then now

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:84%
when the Egyptians and other
cultures around the world,

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Central, South America, and on,
and on started creating then,

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:03.780 align:middle line:84%
you have the initial
structure, and then they

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.020 align:middle line:90%
start creating the stones.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So they intersect
into this geometrical.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Well, first
of all, now you

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.080 align:middle line:90%
have the dolmen, the chamber.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether it's a
hemispherical earth

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.510 align:middle line:84%
mound or a pyramid
shape, these shapes

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.890 align:middle line:84%
are known, if you build
a pyramid or hemisphere,

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.820 align:middle line:84%
they create what we call
a very strong carrier

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.840 align:middle line:84%
wave that they created towards
the base, from the apex

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.800 align:middle line:90%
to the base.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Now this very
strong carrier wave

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:38.680 align:middle line:84%
amplifies the energy of
the sacred power spot,

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.970 align:middle line:90%
amplifies it to a huge extent.

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.990 align:middle line:90%
That's why the word pyramid.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Pyrrha means fire.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:84%
So the pyramid is
actually a central fire

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.330 align:middle line:90%
of the sacred energy.

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
shooting it out.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: From the top
and from the bottom.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is what
are you amplifying?

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.970 align:middle line:84%
You're amplifying the sacred
energy of the sacred path.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Now you use it in
architecture on a spot that

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.930 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have sacred energy.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a problem
because you're amplifying

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.680 align:middle line:90%
whatever energy in the space.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids, ancient
statues, obelisks

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:84%
are made as part of
a sacred power spot.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Now in
BioGeometry, we teach

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:25.640 align:middle line:84%
you, when you create
a pyramid, or a dome,

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:30.920 align:middle line:84%
or something like that, we have
to geometrically make the shape,

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.770 align:middle line:84%
create its own power spots
under it, so that you can use it

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.900 align:middle line:84%
in architecture in
different areas that

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.427 align:middle line:90%
don't have a sacred power spot.

00:21:37.427 --> 00:21:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's say we
go to a new age show,

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and we bring back our
nice little metal pyramid,

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.170 align:middle line:84%
and we put it in our
apartment in New York City.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.277 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: OK, now we have--

00:21:46.277 --> 00:21:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now we have a problem?

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yeah.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.750 align:middle line:84%
What you do, the easiest
thing, is do the solution

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.230 align:middle line:90%
they have in the great pyramid.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.260 align:middle line:90%
You have your pyramids.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:02.120 align:middle line:84%
On the middle of each side, you
make a small scratch pointing

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.810 align:middle line:90%
to the apex to the top.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: So you've created
an eight-sided star.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:12.750 align:middle line:84%
The eight-sided star cancels the
harmful effects of the pyramids.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:15.170 align:middle line:90%
That's a good roll back.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:10%
>>KARIM: Another
one is if you're

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:10%
designing the pyramid
from the beginning,

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.700 align:middle line:10%
then don't look at the angle of
the sides like everybody does.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.200 align:middle line:10%
They measure the
angles of the side.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.720 align:middle line:90%
No geometrical shapes.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.140 align:middle line:84%
You're measuring the angles
of the linear corners.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.610 align:middle line:84%
So you take two corners
of the pyramid like that.

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:36.380 align:middle line:84%
When they meet, they
should meet at 90 degrees.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:84%
When the two corners
meet at 90 degrees,

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.750 align:middle line:84%
in Belgium, we call that
the perfect pyramid.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have 90 degrees
here and two lines coming down

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:50.850 align:middle line:84%
like that, the diagonal
becomes the square root of 2.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:54.090 align:middle line:84%
A square root of 2
is an endless number

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:57.975 align:middle line:84%
that creates its own
vertex and the pyramid.

00:22:57.975 --> 00:23:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's safe- safely
contained within itself.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yes.

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, because
the square root of 2

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.120 align:middle line:84%
has two diagonals, square root
of 2 connected to the apex,

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.320 align:middle line:90%
they create a spiritual vortex.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: So if you are
designing your own pyramid--

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Make sure
it's 90 degrees corners.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:15.205 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Two
corners, 90 degrees.

00:23:15.205 --> 00:23:16.600 align:middle line:84%
It creates a power
spot under it.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.670 align:middle line:90%
Now what about the ziggurat?

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:22.700 align:middle line:84%
What about the pyramids in Egypt
and elsewhere that are stepped?

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.010 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: No.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:29.340 align:middle line:84%
There are many ways of
interacting with the pyramid,

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:33.910 align:middle line:84%
but the main thing it
starts is the chamber.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle line:90%
The chamber inside.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: The soul
of every pyramid

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.700 align:middle line:84%
is the chamber that
connects to the equinoxes

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.360 align:middle line:84%
and that connects the
pyramid to the cycle of life.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Because to understand
ancient shapes,

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:53.530 align:middle line:84%
it will take us to another
topic, and that is today,

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:58.150 align:middle line:84%
we use energy, fossil fuels,
electric energy, and all that.

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:90%
These are very limited energies.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:06.430 align:middle line:84%
99.9% of the energy that fuels
everything in the universe

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:07.490 align:middle line:90%
is life force.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: It makes
the planets rotate.

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Imagine how much energy you
need to make the planets rotate.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:18.200 align:middle line:84%
So life force is
your main energy.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:90%
It is alive.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Imagine an energy
you can speak to.

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:22.370 align:middle line:90%
It is alive.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.750 align:middle line:84%
When you pray, you're actually
speaking to life force.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.570 align:middle line:84%
You're asking it, and it will
do it because the universe,

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:33.160 align:middle line:84%
life force means universal
mind, life, consciousness,

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.690 align:middle line:84%
everything in one, and the
huge power that animates

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:40.100 align:middle line:90%
everything in the universe.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine a civilization
that is so advanced

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:51.250 align:middle line:84%
that it must recognize life
force as its main fuel.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you are thinking
about ancient Egypt,

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:55.590 align:middle line:84%
don't think about
they're trying to create

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.850 align:middle line:84%
magnetism, electricity,
or something like that.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:00.677 align:middle line:90%
To them, they'd laugh at you.

00:25:00.677 --> 00:25:01.510 align:middle line:90%
The ancient priests?

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:02.310 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:05.160 align:middle line:84%
They are actually
using life force

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.710 align:middle line:84%
as their main propeller
of everything.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.910 align:middle line:84%
The animator, the
universal animator.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you use life
force as your fuel,

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.435 align:middle line:90%
everything becomes alive.

00:25:15.435 --> 00:25:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you say using
life force, if you're using it,

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:22.170 align:middle line:84%
that means there's a place that
it's kind of been aggregated

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:23.110 align:middle line:90%
or captured.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Is this within the
architecture of places,

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:28.290 align:middle line:84%
or are you doing it
mostly with your own mind?

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:29.915 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: When you're
moving your hands,

00:25:29.915 --> 00:25:31.180 align:middle line:90%
what energy are you using?

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Life force, I guess.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:33.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's always
movement, circular.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: When you speak.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.930 align:middle line:84%
But when you understand
me and I understand you,

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:43.110 align:middle line:84%
that's still life force because
that's the consciousness.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:46.960 align:middle line:84%
When you think, that's
the universal mind

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.240 align:middle line:84%
within the life force giving
you one of its attributes.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's why you think.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So now when you're
talking, going back

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.820 align:middle line:84%
into your Egyptian sacred
spots, sacred architecture,

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.010 align:middle line:84%
those were taking life
force into consideration,

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:04.000 align:middle line:84%
and they were
generators of life force

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.240 align:middle line:84%
or simply places you could
easily access life force?

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.330 align:middle line:90%
How did that work?

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Life force went
into everything in life.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Everything you
said, every letter

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.770 align:middle line:90%
had to activate life force.

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:22.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why when they
did their miracles,

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:24.770 align:middle line:90%
they used the power of the word.

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:26.170 align:middle line:90%
That's what's called hekau.

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Hekau means the word
that changes things.

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So they knew, for example,
the word rrr, rrr.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.530 align:middle line:84%
They knew that rrr
interacts with life force

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:41.380 align:middle line:90%
and creates a carrier wave.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: So every
letter they used

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:51.430 align:middle line:84%
was a way of accessing a
function of the life force.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So language became putting
the life force in work.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, every movement you
did, when I hold this cup,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.530 align:middle line:84%
whether I hold it that way,
or that way, or that way,

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:05.710 align:middle line:90%
it makes a difference.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.410 align:middle line:84%
When I move my
fingers, my hands,

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.170 align:middle line:90%
everything makes a difference.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.730 align:middle line:84%
You should do it in resonance
with the proper life force.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:19.000 align:middle line:84%
So life force becomes the
dimension in which you live,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.010 align:middle line:90%
because you live in it.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:24.640 align:middle line:84%
We are not aware
that life force is

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.880 align:middle line:84%
the background of all the
multidimensionality we have.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.940 align:middle line:84%
It's the background that
animates everything.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And we, just because we
don't see this background,

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.820 align:middle line:90%
science called it a void.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.900 align:middle line:90%
A nothing.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.210 align:middle line:90%
How can it be a nothing?

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like black
holes are nothing?

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.050 align:middle line:90%
They just suck--

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yeah.

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.540 align:middle line:84%
You call them nothing, but
who says they're nothing?

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yeah.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Because we are living in an
electromagnetic universe,

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.550 align:middle line:90%
at the speed of light.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So everything, the beginning
is always the Big Bang.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:27:59.730 align:middle line:90%
It's the beginning.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Or the zero point
field is the beginning.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.020 align:middle line:90%
All those are not beginning.

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.970 align:middle line:90%
All these are end stages.

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Because when you start
from the level of divinity

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:13.300 align:middle line:84%
where zero is equal to infinity,
the speed is very high.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.670 align:middle line:90%
And then you go down, down.

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:17.850 align:middle line:84%
You're going down, slowly
down, all the way down,

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:21.200 align:middle line:84%
down until you reach
the speed of light.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.540 align:middle line:84%
At the speed of light,
what do you get?

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.240 align:middle line:90%
Sparks.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.870 align:middle line:90%
Every spark is a universe.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.600 align:middle line:90%
Every spark is a Big Bang.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's a late
stage of creation.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Your emotions are not in the
electromagnetic dimension.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Your mental energy is not in
the electromagnetic dimension

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:43.570 align:middle line:84%
because electromagnetic
dimension means linear time.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Now your emotions don't
work by linear time.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts don't
work by linear time.

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:52.720 align:middle line:84%
That means they are higher than
the electromagnetic dimension.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:56.800 align:middle line:10%
And they can take you into
multidimensional time,

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.970 align:middle line:10%
which is beyond linear time.

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now we're
getting to another area.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Let me start there.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.080 align:middle line:90%
So for example, movement.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.690 align:middle line:84%
You showed me with a cup
when we were off camera,

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:12.132 align:middle line:84%
that if you turn it this way,
is it clockwise eight times?

00:29:12.132 --> 00:29:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Eight notches.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Eight notches clockwise and
three notches anticlockwise.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:21.280 align:middle line:90%
Just even numbers, clockwise.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.557 align:middle line:90%
Odd numbers, anticlockwise.

00:29:22.557 --> 00:29:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then what happens?

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: You get a bidirectional
vortex that connects you

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.500 align:middle line:90%
to higher dimension.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Bidirectional vortex means
mental and emotional,

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:37.570 align:middle line:90%
like the shape of DNA.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:40.700 align:middle line:84%
You get this vortex connecting
you to a higher dimension.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:46.780 align:middle line:84%
That means the cup now connects
you to a sort of hybrid time.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Linear and
multidimensional time.

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:54.880 align:middle line:84%
It connects the linear time
of your sensory perception

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:59.180 align:middle line:84%
to the multidimensional
time of your subconscious,

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.780 align:middle line:90%
of the heart intellect.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Heart intellect is on
multidimensional time.

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Now you also showed me
something else that was similar.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:10.570 align:middle line:90%
A movement of your head.

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yes.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's show
us the movement you did

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and explain it in
which direction

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.625 align:middle line:84%
you're moving your head
and what this is doing.

00:30:18.625 --> 00:30:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Well, when you
move your head this way

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:27.510 align:middle line:84%
or any circular
motion, or let's say

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:28.822 align:middle line:90%
you move your hands that way.

00:30:28.822 --> 00:30:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
about your eyeballs?

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yeah.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.730 align:middle line:84%
You can move your
eyeballs that way.

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:34.230 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel it.

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Move your eyeballs like
this, and you feel--

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you move
it in a circular motion.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: You're going
into this other dimension.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:44.770 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you say,
OK, well, so what?

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:48.460 align:middle line:90%
I just do this.

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.260 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.860 align:middle line:84%
The life force in its
full dimensionality,

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.740 align:middle line:84%
the way it runs all the
functions of your body

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:59.520 align:middle line:84%
is activated in full
when you connect

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.920 align:middle line:90%
into its multidimensional time.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise,
it's just an aspect

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:08.860 align:middle line:84%
of life force in linear
time that we have.

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:10.780 align:middle line:84%
But when you connect
to the source,

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.700 align:middle line:84%
this is where
healing energy really

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.050 align:middle line:90%
exists in your subconscious.

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:17.500 align:middle line:84%
So you don't know, you're just
rolling your eyes like this

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.120 align:middle line:90%
or moving your head like this.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Or when you walk like this,
you do your hands a bit,

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.080 align:middle line:90%
any type of rotation.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.500 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians,
they had linear time.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Of course, they knew it.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.840 align:middle line:84%
But they had another
aspect of circular time,

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and they used to
call that, nehneh.

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And today in Arabic,
when we say nehneh,

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:41.810 align:middle line:84%
it means-- when you do
this, when you do this,

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:42.800 align:middle line:90%
you say nehneh.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Because Egyptian Arabic
has so many words

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.930 align:middle line:84%
from the ancient
Egyptian language in it.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:55.760 align:middle line:84%
So when you do this,
usually, before you

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.480 align:middle line:84%
start doing any work sometimes,
you put yourself at ease

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.600 align:middle line:90%
like this, and you--

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I think for meditation,
it would be ideal.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Because you
know, in meditation,

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.500 align:middle line:84%
instead of taking
the time of going in,

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.388 align:middle line:90%
here you're already there.

00:32:12.388 --> 00:32:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I like anything
that's efficient.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Well, you know, at my
age, you become a lazy Egyptian.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:20.330 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to do
things that take time.

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:22.760 align:middle line:90%
I want everything like this.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And so just do this,
and you're in it.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so then you're
able to access reality

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.430 align:middle line:84%
beyond our understood
linear time and space.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: It's when you do this,
the subconscious is activated,

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.910 align:middle line:84%
and you get this sort of
intuitive aspect of doing

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:44.030 align:middle line:90%
the right thing.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So now, believe it or not, we
have about 10 minutes left.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:50.720 align:middle line:90%
We're having so much fun.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.010 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into the
notion you've done this.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:55.010 align:middle line:90%
You're going into it.

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:57.190 align:middle line:84%
You want to see maybe
a little glimpse

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:58.790 align:middle line:90%
of why something's going on.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And even an infinity loop,
that's kind of crazy.

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And you're opening up your
connection to the subconscious

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:09.670 align:middle line:84%
and non-linear time and
maybe going into what

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:11.490 align:middle line:90%
we consider a past incarnation.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: OK.

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
momentarily talk

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:18.840 align:middle line:84%
from your perspective about what
reincarnation and karma actually

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.640 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Well, we have
to explain everything

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.690 align:middle line:84%
in the linearity
of time and space.

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So when you explain anything you
have to say before and after,

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:33.220 align:middle line:84%
cause and effect,
life and death.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.910 align:middle line:84%
The problem with this,
it creates tension.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Because when you see polarities
like that, tension is created.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Now from a
multidimensional aspect,

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:48.040 align:middle line:84%
the linearity is
not from A to B.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:52.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a center that
creates AB and back.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.970 align:middle line:84%
That's how one linear axis
in multidimensional space is.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:59.430 align:middle line:84%
You see it here from one
direction to the other.

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:03.080 align:middle line:84%
In reality there, the
end and the beginning

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.490 align:middle line:90%
are two faces of one coin.

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:08.179 align:middle line:84%
So your moment of birth
and your moment of death

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.159 align:middle line:84%
are interconnected
through your whole life,

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:11.989 align:middle line:90%
and they affect each other.

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:15.290 align:middle line:84%
We do lots of
exercises like this,

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:18.090 align:middle line:84%
how to show that the end
affects the beginning.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:20.540 align:middle line:84%
We have lots of
exercises in BioGeometry,

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:23.623 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have time
now to go into that.

00:34:23.623 --> 00:34:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's say you're
seeing in yourself almost

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:26.429 align:middle line:90%
a pattern.

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:28.387 align:middle line:84%
You're wondering where
a pattern has come from.

00:34:28.387 --> 00:34:30.409 align:middle line:84%
Say a woman who has
an emotional pattern

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:33.300 align:middle line:84%
of being a doormat to
the people around her.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And she's depressed, and she's
always laying herself down

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.440 align:middle line:90%
before everyone.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.889 align:middle line:84%
And now let's look at that
from what could be considered

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:41.189 align:middle line:90%
a reincarnation point of view.

00:34:41.189 --> 00:34:41.989 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: OK.

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:43.320 align:middle line:90%
Well, look at it that way.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.120 align:middle line:84%
The impulse, because resonance
has to start with an impulse.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.230 align:middle line:84%
The impulse has to
start from here.

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:54.090 align:middle line:84%
So she, at a certain moment,
behaved in such a way

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:59.110 align:middle line:84%
or created an impulse here in
this life of being a doormat.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.680 align:middle line:84%
They created this
impulse in one action.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Now the next time
she faces an action,

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.440 align:middle line:84%
there's an automatism
in the brain,

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.780 align:middle line:84%
so she'll automatically
repeat it again.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Now the problem is not
just repeating it again.

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:19.470 align:middle line:84%
This action here will be in
resonance on her subconscious

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:24.670 align:middle line:84%
level with similar actions
that exists multidimensionally

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:26.040 align:middle line:90%
on the subconscious level.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.520 align:middle line:84%
There is no before,
after, or present.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:33.297 align:middle line:84%
You could be here in
the future, in the past.

00:35:33.297 --> 00:35:35.130 align:middle line:84%
At the same time you
could be an individual,

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:36.838 align:middle line:84%
you could be collective
at the same time.

00:35:36.838 --> 00:35:38.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a multidimensional state.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
energy of doormat

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:42.610 align:middle line:84%
has been somewhere
spun into motion.

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yeah.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: It goes
there, and then it

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:51.452 align:middle line:84%
goes into similar doormat
presences throughout time

00:35:51.452 --> 00:35:52.660 align:middle line:90%
and space throughout history.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And so there might be
somewhere, the typical doormat

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.960 align:middle line:90%
in history or something.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So you take that aspect
from that personality.

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:04.920 align:middle line:84%
You don't take the
whole personality.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:08.297 align:middle line:84%
That personality might
be a genius musician.

00:36:08.297 --> 00:36:09.130 align:middle line:90%
You don't take that.

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're just
looking at the one area.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: You just take
the doormat aspect,

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:15.610 align:middle line:84%
and then you think,
that was my incarnation.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Now it can't be your incarnation
because beyond time and space,

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.730 align:middle line:84%
everything exists
at the same time.

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:26.460 align:middle line:84%
But here, it gets translated
into a phase in your life.

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Now this phase in your life
is part of your evolution.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.790 align:middle line:84%
So all what you think
are past incarnations

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.940 align:middle line:84%
are actually steps of
evolution in this life.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.650 align:middle line:84%
They're steps of
evolution in this life.

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:47.330 align:middle line:84%
But those criteria that
you are in resonance with,

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:51.560 align:middle line:84%
they connect you to other
lives of other people.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.690 align:middle line:84%
But on the other side,
they're all simultaneous.

00:36:55.690 --> 00:37:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So you're affecting them as
much as they are affecting you.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:06.170 align:middle line:84%
So you exist in their
evolution, and they

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:07.800 align:middle line:90%
exist in your evolution.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So now, you've decided
this is not functional

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:13.020 align:middle line:90%
and working for you anymore.

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.380 align:middle line:84%
You want to make a
change in that pattern.

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you've
even attracted people

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.870 align:middle line:84%
all through history or whatever,
nonlinear time and space,

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:24.580 align:middle line:84%
into your reality that
take advantage of doormats.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Well, that's
very easy to do, you know.

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:30.245 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: I tell you,
usually, you get--

00:37:30.245 --> 00:37:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I only bring
that up to the notion of karma

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:33.770 align:middle line:90%
if it goes too far.

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: You get
this automatism.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.800 align:middle line:90%
It keeps happening.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:41.060 align:middle line:84%
So you want to actually
not let the linear cause

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.140 align:middle line:84%
and effect keep
repeating itself here.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:49.010 align:middle line:84%
You want to let the
multidimensional space, the life

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:52.040 align:middle line:84%
force, come in and
harmonize this action.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:52.880 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do?

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:56.330 align:middle line:84%
The next time you
get a situation,

00:37:56.330 --> 00:38:00.060 align:middle line:84%
completely stop for a
moment before reacting.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's say in general,
let's say I have--

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:04.243 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That allows the
light force to come in, right?

00:38:04.243 --> 00:38:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Let's say I have a weak
nature and aggressive nature.

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Every time something
happens, I'm going to use,

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:12.350 align:middle line:84%
whether I'm weak
or aggressive, I'm

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:15.000 align:middle line:84%
going to use that
aspect every time.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.990 align:middle line:84%
But the person in front of me,
sometimes this nature will help.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:23.010 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, it will not help.

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.650 align:middle line:84%
But I'm using the same one
with every type of person.

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is, if I decide now
when something happens, I just

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.130 align:middle line:90%
stagnate, stop for instance.

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:38.310 align:middle line:84%
When you stop, for instance,
something happens that's in you.

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:39.900 align:middle line:90%
You're used to.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to react, but
you're stopping yourself

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:43.580 align:middle line:90%
from the action.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:49.530 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, this lifeforce,
this harmonizing aspect

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.630 align:middle line:84%
comes in, but it
is environmental.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:53.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not just you.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.910 align:middle line:90%
So it will assess the situation.

00:38:56.910 --> 00:39:02.490 align:middle line:84%
It will assess what's the
right way of acting here.

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:08.100 align:middle line:84%
So you might decide, the
proper way in this situation

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.230 align:middle line:90%
is I act as a doormat.

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:middle line:90%
Or no.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.250 align:middle line:84%
The proper way is
to do the opposite.

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:17.590 align:middle line:84%
To be aggressive
in this situation.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Even if you decide to act as
a doormat in this situation,

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:25.510 align:middle line:84%
it is because in that moment,
that's the best way to react.

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:28.740 align:middle line:84%
You led the life
force to inform--

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: To tell you
there is a higher

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:34.740 align:middle line:90%
order that will make you react.

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:40.290 align:middle line:84%
If you do that once or
twice, all of a sudden,

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:44.190 align:middle line:84%
you get this aspect
of wisdom that

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:48.600 align:middle line:84%
will make you decide
which is the right path

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:51.750 align:middle line:84%
to go because now, it's
like taking a step backwards

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:53.490 align:middle line:90%
and looking forwards.

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So you become
master of your own--

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very
direct and simple.

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:58.690 align:middle line:90%
And I love that.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:39:59.620 align:middle line:90%
It's very beautiful.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.520 align:middle line:84%
So what happens with
the notion of karma?

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Well, if you think
that karma is something that

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:14.480 align:middle line:84%
is governing your life or
the Akashic records are

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.170 align:middle line:90%
something that have to be, no.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:21.430 align:middle line:84%
If you go on the other side, all
the information in the universe

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:22.870 align:middle line:90%
exists at the same time.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:24.818 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing
affecting anything.

00:40:24.818 --> 00:40:26.110 align:middle line:90%
It's just the law of resonance.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:27.770 align:middle line:90%
Things are resonating together.

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So whatever you put
your interest in,

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:32.930 align:middle line:90%
you resonate with automatically.

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you have karma, karma
means cause and effect.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:44.740 align:middle line:84%
If you are thinking of linear
time, karma exists for you.

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of
understanding things.

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:51.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you just go into
multidimensional time,

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.700 align:middle line:90%
stop for a moment.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:56.820 align:middle line:84%
If you stop for a
moment, then karma

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.623 align:middle line:84%
will have difficulty
dealing with you.

00:40:59.623 --> 00:41:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yes.

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Because how will it deal
with somebody who is just,

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:06.190 align:middle line:90%
there's a circle.

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:07.830 align:middle line:84%
You're walking
around the circle.

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:10.660 align:middle line:90%
So I know where to catch you.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.600 align:middle line:90%
That's with karma.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.850 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden, if I'm
looking for you and you're

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:16.940 align:middle line:90%
standing in the center.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So I don't see on
the circle anymore.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:20.180 align:middle line:90%
You're not here.

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.870 align:middle line:90%
So I can't affect you anymore.

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And then when you decide
to come out again,

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:27.450 align:middle line:84%
you come out in the
direction you want,

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:28.658 align:middle line:90%
and nothing has affected you.

00:41:28.658 --> 00:41:31.117 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're saying,
even with the notion of karma--

00:41:31.117 --> 00:41:32.050 align:middle line:90%
So say the opposite.

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Say you've been very
aggressive, and your aggression

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.820 align:middle line:90%
has harmed people in the past.

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And maybe this is again
been reflected out

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.850 align:middle line:90%
through times, experiences.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Now you become aware
of it, and you're

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.920 align:middle line:84%
questioning whether that's
not maybe the best way for you

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.910 align:middle line:90%
to go anymore.

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:50.080 align:middle line:90%
So you pause.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:54.260 align:middle line:84%
You just stop when your next
aggressive tendency happens.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: And then think.

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Allow the
life force to come in.

00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:59.900 align:middle line:90%
Go into the other space maybe.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yes.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.610 align:middle line:90%
Think with that person.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's say a person is very
strong and very aggressive.

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Now if I stop and
not do anything,

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.690 align:middle line:84%
that person didn't
learn a lesson.

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Because he knows he's
an aggressive person.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.210 align:middle line:90%
He expects me not to react.

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:24.080 align:middle line:84%
But if I stop for a
moment and think, then

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.210 align:middle line:84%
maybe with that person,
I should be aggressive

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:28.940 align:middle line:84%
because he doesn't
expect it, and this

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.460 align:middle line:90%
is what will change him.

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:32.810 align:middle line:90%
Now we come to a weak person.

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is hitting them on
the head, this weak person.

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:37.140 align:middle line:90%
So you don't want to do that.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:40.852 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden,
you decide, no.

00:42:40.852 --> 00:42:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let me be
gentle and let them--

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yeah.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So he will all of a sudden
look at you and say,

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:46.910 align:middle line:90%
you won't understand.

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:51.140 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't know how can a
person treat him that way.

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.800 align:middle line:84%
So that you bring in the wisdom
from the multidimensionality

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.600 align:middle line:90%
in that.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.950 align:middle line:90%
But remember--

00:42:56.950 --> 00:43:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that is making
that a resonant adjustment

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:01.490 align:middle line:90%
that we call karma.

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: It's you choose
what to interact with.

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And by choosing what
to interact with,

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.510 align:middle line:84%
you've chosen the
direction from where you

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:15.160 align:middle line:90%
want the information to come.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.710 align:middle line:84%
You see, you are master
of your universe.

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Don't think
always a past reincarnation

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:24.140 align:middle line:90%
will dictate what I do here.

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Karma will dictate
what I do here.

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:26.770 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:30.170 align:middle line:84%
All that is left
brain perception

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:35.620 align:middle line:84%
trying to explain things from
completely different aspects

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.900 align:middle line:84%
that don't have all that
into our time and space.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Remember, if there is
one reality, something,

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.860 align:middle line:84%
one reality in the
multidimensional subconscious

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:46.730 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:52.860 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to perceive it
here through whatever means,

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:56.830 align:middle line:84%
through any type of psychic
effect, whatever it means.

00:43:56.830 --> 00:44:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, for this reality to
come out, first of all,

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:07.080 align:middle line:84%
it has to be time and space
stamped in our linearity

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.270 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
have time and space.

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So you have to give
it time and space.

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And then it has
to be personified

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.120 align:middle line:90%
because this is the duality.

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.490 align:middle line:90%
I have to personify it.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.220 align:middle line:90%
How do I personify it?

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:23.640 align:middle line:84%
I go to the database
in my brain, which

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.290 align:middle line:90%
is culturally-based.

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:28.560 align:middle line:84%
So I use my cultural
background to personify it.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Because if my left brain
doesn't personify it,

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:35.820 align:middle line:84%
it cannot separate it
from the background.

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
other subconscious,

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.630 align:middle line:90%
you are part of the whole.

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:43.050 align:middle line:84%
That's an aspect that we
don't have to go into today,

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
female perception.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But just
gives you a chance

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:46.993 align:middle line:90%
to identify what the thing is.

00:44:46.993 --> 00:44:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: The thing is.

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Now you culturally
defined it, and you put it

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:55.210 align:middle line:84%
in your time and
space, and that's

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:56.500 align:middle line:90%
your way of understanding.

00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:00.040 align:middle line:84%
But you should understand that
they are all translations.

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Now you and I could
look at the same reality

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:07.320 align:middle line:90%
in the multidimensional level.

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:10.160 align:middle line:84%
You'll explain it in
your cultural background.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.060 align:middle line:84%
I'll explain it in my
cultural background.

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, I say I'm right,

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and you say you're right,
and we start fighting.

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.570 align:middle line:90%
In reality, we're both right.

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:20.540 align:middle line:84%
We're both expressing
the abstract reality

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:21.530 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So we should always know that
whenever people are speaking

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:27.800 align:middle line:84%
about Akashic,
about reincarnation,

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.260 align:middle line:84%
about things like that,
they're translating it

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:35.722 align:middle line:84%
into time and space, plus
cultural personification.

00:45:35.722 --> 00:45:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But by
taking that pause,

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:41.310 align:middle line:84%
and maybe going to another
little dimensional state,

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:43.800 align:middle line:84%
and allowing wisdom to
come forward and dictate

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:47.870 align:middle line:84%
how you respond, that is
really the balancing of karma.

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: That's the balancing.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yes.

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.038 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Creating
a new resonance.

00:45:52.038 --> 00:45:54.718 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: Actually, we don't have
time to go into that today--

00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
actually out of time.

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yeah.

00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this is one
of the strong points

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:07.560 align:middle line:84%
of female energy as a form of
perception of qualities that we,

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:08.758 align:middle line:90%
maybe some other time.

00:46:08.758 --> 00:46:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Another conversation.

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:11.470 align:middle line:90%
Now you got everybody curious.

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yeah.

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Another conversation
for another time.

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Regina.

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This has
been wonderful.

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:19.282 align:middle line:84%
You really helped bring it
down to a level where people

00:46:19.282 --> 00:46:21.090 align:middle line:84%
can interact with
it and understand

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:23.880 align:middle line:84%
some of the things they can
do practically in their world.

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.510 align:middle line:10%
>>KARIM: You really
helped bring me down.

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:28.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's my job.

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:29.370 align:middle line:10%
>>KARIM: Yeah.

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:31.443 align:middle line:10%
You brought me
down into reality.

00:46:31.443 --> 00:46:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
beautiful though.

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Very practical and
very helpful for us.

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:35.580 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: You know, BioGeometry,
although it's up there,

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:43.630 align:middle line:84%
it's a science that actually
has practical application

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:44.495 align:middle line:90%
in everything.

00:46:44.495 --> 00:46:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Just like we talked
about in the beginning

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:50.530 align:middle line:84%
when we were talking about the
shape of the space for a person

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:52.050 align:middle line:90%
who's autistic or not autistic.

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Yes.

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:54.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's very materialistic,
practical, and everything.

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you so much.

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:56.060 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>KARIM: Thank you, Regina.

00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We will talk again.

00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.020 align:middle line:90%
We only scratched the surface.

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:00.645 align:middle line:84%
>>KARIM: I'm very
happy to be with you,

00:47:00.645 --> 00:47:06.698 align:middle line:84%
and hoping to see you many more
times whenever I come this way.

00:47:06.698 --> 00:47:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's a
fascinating conversation

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and wonderful way
to view the world.

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.170 align:middle line:84%
I think we can all feel this
when the geometry is out

00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:13.970 align:middle line:90%
of balance.

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:16.270 align:middle line:84%
What we can do is now
start keeping it healthy

00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:17.750 align:middle line:90%
and bringing it back to a whole.

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:20.180 align:middle line:84%
We just talked about some
of those little techniques.

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.060 align:middle line:10%
To learn more about
Dr. Karim's work,
