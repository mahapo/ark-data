>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Chris Hardy has

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:10%
spent a lifetime of
research attempting

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.690 align:middle line:10%
to understand the relationship
between what is considered

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:10%
the divine and humanity.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.010 align:middle line:10%
In her new book, "Wars
of the Anunnaki,"

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.580 align:middle line:10%
Chris uses repetitive patterns
in semantics to decipher

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:10%
what may be a revolutionary
view of the story

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.000 align:middle line:10%
made popular by Zecharia
Sitchin so many years ago.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.260 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Chris.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.210 align:middle line:84%
I have to say it was really
quite a nice journey going

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:90%
through your book.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a subject that I've
read through different lenses

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.000 align:middle line:90%
many times.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:84%
But I think what
I enjoyed about it

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.879 align:middle line:84%
is the language was
so alive and personal.

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Even though there
are a lot of quotes

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot
of research, it

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:84%
doesn't come off with
the academic feeling

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.760 align:middle line:90%
that alienates people.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.999 align:middle line:90%
It makes a living story.

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRIS HARDY: Thank you.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it begins
with a dedication.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.240 align:middle line:84%
It says, "To Martin Luther
King for the promise

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.190 align:middle line:90%
he asked from me."

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.120 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Aha.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.740 align:middle line:10%
You really put your
finger on something

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.150 align:middle line:10%
that I wanted to
be a little hidden.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's not hidden.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.838 align:middle line:90%
It's right up front.

00:01:36.838 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDY: People might wonder,
you know, what age I could be.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.895 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You put it there.

00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:43.180 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.080 align:middle line:10%
>>HARDY: It was a very
interesting, but at one point

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.740 align:middle line:10%
one day I had already published
as a first volume, "DNA

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.340 align:middle line:10%
of the Gods," the second
volume is so much harder.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.300 align:middle line:90%
It took so much more out of me.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:84%
It was really coming
up with it was really

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.430 align:middle line:84%
fighting with some
kind of shadows

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.976 align:middle line:90%
in our collective unconscious.

00:02:14.976 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And also I knew that
I was going to be--

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.690 align:middle line:90%
I could not be going halfway.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.670 align:middle line:90%
You know, I had to--

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You had to go
for it and you really did.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDY: --let my
whole being say

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and this is why the two
books have been written very,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.310 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And so suddenly I had
some kind of hesitation.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.720 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering
if I was not going

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.350 align:middle line:90%
to shock religious people.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.810 align:middle line:84%
What would happen
then in my life

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.190 align:middle line:84%
with my other
scientific research.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was in my car
coming back in the night.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:90%
And I could not move.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.310 align:middle line:90%
I was to my house.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.210 align:middle line:84%
I could just not
get out of my car.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly I
experienced a contact

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.030 align:middle line:90%
with Martin Luther King.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And in this contact,
he talked to me

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and because he is also
a symbol of somebody who

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:84%
has fought for an ideal and
for the truth and for justice.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.800 align:middle line:90%
And it was so strong in me.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said you have to
publish the second book.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.740 align:middle line:90%
You have to.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was like
asking you to do it.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, then
I do it, I do it.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And then, that was it
with my hesitation.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.560 align:middle line:90%
I went with it.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you found
all the resistance starting

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.820 align:middle line:90%
to drop away to going in?

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Because this was almost--

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.050 align:middle line:84%
it almost seemed as though
there was an element of soul

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.570 align:middle line:90%
searching in it for you.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.910 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDY: I have
done a lot of soul

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.300 align:middle line:84%
searching because I started
meditation when I was 18.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Almost collective
soul searching, I should say.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDY: I would say that was
more on the collective level.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.365 align:middle line:84%
Me, I was living like, first,
when I was young as an atheist.

00:04:20.365 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Atheist, OK.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDY: And then,
when at 13 years old,

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I started to do some
meditation and to open up

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:84%
to a quest, an inner
quest, for knowledge,

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.750 align:middle line:84%
through meditation,
through inner states.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:84%
So I had my way very clearly
on my scientific research

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.330 align:middle line:84%
on consciousness, a
theory of consciousness,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.720 align:middle line:84%
based on the systems,
the science of systems.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.950 align:middle line:90%
So I was OK.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:84%
But when I discovered
Sitchin and I saw

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.220 align:middle line:84%
that all the information
that was there

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:84%
buried in the Sumerian
tablets and what

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:84%
it meant for us as human beings,
as a woman, as a psychologist

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.730 align:middle line:84%
specifically for me,
you know, I said, no, I

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.250 align:middle line:90%
have to go over this data.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.090 align:middle line:84%
I have to get into
it, study it in depth,

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and I have say
something about it.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:90%
And you did.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.320 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:84%
So in this particular story, I
think what was really bringing

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.110 align:middle line:84%
it alive is you were giving
a different kind of voice

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.250 align:middle line:84%
for the motivations of why the
characters that we've all heard

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.320 align:middle line:84%
about-- the Anunnaki, Enlil,
his brother Enki, and so forth--

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.080 align:middle line:84%
the motivations
throughout the book.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
through a lot of it,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.800 align:middle line:84%
certainly the
ramifications of it

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.840 align:middle line:90%
all the way into modern history.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.110 align:middle line:84%
But the motivations for
trying to just squash

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.980 align:middle line:84%
humanity, control
and squash humanity

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.220 align:middle line:84%
was really quite
unconscionably cruel

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.390 align:middle line:84%
what was perpetrated
against humanity.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:90%
And this is our place, you know.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Granted, let's start
from the beginning.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Other species have been
here, arguably as long as--

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.890 align:middle line:84%
well almost as long
as the human species--

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.752 align:middle line:90%
what became the human species.

00:06:26.752 --> 00:06:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Talk a little bit about
the beginnings of that.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.510 align:middle line:90%
So we set the stage.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDY: So beginning
from the Anunnaki coming

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.100 align:middle line:84%
from another planet, or
the beginning of humanity,

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.062 align:middle line:90%
the creation of humanity?

00:06:38.062 --> 00:06:39.020 align:middle line:90%
Their coming, you want?

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.193 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with their
coming, because we're

00:06:41.193 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:84%
isolating it to that 400,000
year period of history.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Yes.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to try to be quick.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.995 align:middle line:84%
What happened is that in the
epic of creation, Enuma Elish,

00:06:54.995 --> 00:07:00.670 align:middle line:84%
they speak about their planet
being a nomad planet who

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.540 align:middle line:84%
was attracted by
our solar system

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:84%
and started being
attracted toward our sun

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and started crossing the
orbits of the planets

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:21.760 align:middle line:84%
from the outer ones all the way
to the inner planets like Earth

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.560 align:middle line:90%
and Mars.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.893 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Into our solar system.

00:07:23.893 --> 00:07:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Yes.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And all the descriptions
we find in the Enuma Elish

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.940 align:middle line:90%
are perfectly correct.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.180 align:middle line:84%
The more our science
is discovering

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.690 align:middle line:84%
in different facets, you
know, the more our science

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:44.970 align:middle line:84%
is getting more sophisticated
and the more whatever

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.720 align:middle line:84%
is there as information
in the Sumerian tablets--

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.140 align:middle line:84%
which I remind people
are 5,005 years old.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 5,500
years old, right.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Yes.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.190 align:middle line:90%
The oldest one was found.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.050 align:middle line:84%
But we still are
discovering new ones.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So we may discover
even older ones.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And those were the
oldest one start

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:15.060 align:middle line:84%
with describe saying this is
a copy of a very ancient book.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.960 align:middle line:84%
So already, it was not the
start of their civilization.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.580 align:middle line:84%
They had everything already
in terms of civilization.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.990 align:middle line:84%
So they describe
coming toward the sun.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And they describe
also stopping on Mars

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.520 align:middle line:84%
to replenish their
water reserves.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And they were using
hydrogen fuel.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.120 align:middle line:90%
And so water.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And they described Mars
as having a lot of water,

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:52.660 align:middle line:84%
a nice place to stay,
and lush, visibly.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lush.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:54.990 align:middle line:90%
You say, and lush.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.430 align:middle line:90%
Green and lush, visibly.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Green and lush, yes.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And so this is something
that has come up only

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.500 align:middle line:84%
in the last two years
with a physicist

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:90%
called John Brandenburg.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And he has written a book
called "Death on Mars."

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And first he came
up with the concept

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:23.580 align:middle line:84%
of a paleo-ocean on Mars while
they were, in the establishment

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:29.700 align:middle line:84%
science, still arguing was there
water or is there water or not.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.784 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is
that this paleo-ocean--

00:09:33.784 --> 00:09:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How do you say it?

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:35.750 align:middle line:90%
Paleo?

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Paleo-ocean.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:43.670 align:middle line:84%
A very antique, paleolithic
ocean, you know?

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And so we see clearly,
when we see the maps of--

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.810 align:middle line:84%
the photos of Mars, we see
clearly the delineation

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:90%
of the coastline.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And so it was extremely
easy for a scientist

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.960 align:middle line:84%
to analyze the sediments
to come up with the fact

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.250 align:middle line:90%
that it had been--

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean you had a
very, very flat fifth

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:84%
of the planet towards
the North Pole

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.850 align:middle line:84%
was totally flat like it
was the bottom of an ocean.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you had, of course, a
very crispy coastline and then

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.290 align:middle line:90%
mountains and valleys.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.500 align:middle line:90%
And very, very obvious.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And so was that was
about four years ago

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.260 align:middle line:90%
in his first book in 2011.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.030 align:middle line:90%
And now in his new book--

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean before he
wrote the book--

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:44.440 align:middle line:84%
he came up with the interesting
analysis of isotopes

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.120 align:middle line:90%
of that are nuclear isotopes.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Notably one which is called,
one is thorium and the other one

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:58.050 align:middle line:90%
is xenon 129.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 129, which is
known for what on our planet?

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDY: It's known only
as a trace remaining

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.731 align:middle line:90%
after a nuclear explosion.

00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Weapons grade.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Yes.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.560 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So you have it a lot
in the Nevada desert.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Nevada
desert from all

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.950 align:middle line:90%
of the test that had happened.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.980 align:middle line:84%
They're finding
this on Mars, right?

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Yes.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Not only on the rocks,
but also on meteorites.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So the very important point
is that xenon 129 cannot be

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.900 align:middle line:90%
a natural element.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.040 align:middle line:90%
You cannot find it naturally.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.770 align:middle line:84%
It has to be the result
of nuclear explosion.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDY: So John Brandenburg
went further and also

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:57.760 align:middle line:84%
was discussing and interacting
with nuclear physicists who

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:04.060 align:middle line:84%
were kind of taken aback
but not refusing the element

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.525 align:middle line:90%
of information that was clear.

00:12:07.525 --> 00:12:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So science
basically rejected--

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.360 align:middle line:84%
rejected the presence
of the xenon 129 or just

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.100 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to
address it or what?

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.830 align:middle line:90%
They were stunned.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDY: What happened
with the ocean,

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.530 align:middle line:84%
the paleo-ocean is an indication
of what's going to happen,

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.090 align:middle line:90%
because this is very new.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:29.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean they had to agree
with the paleo-ocean concept

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.970 align:middle line:90%
on the data.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And they will at one point,
have to agree with the data.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean the isotopes, you know,
you cannot falsify the data.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.150 align:middle line:84%
You can't falsify
the type of isotope.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Yes.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:48.320 align:middle line:84%
So basically he came
up with the idea

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:56.964 align:middle line:84%
that nukes were exploded from
high in the atmosphere over two

00:12:56.964 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
major centers of the Martian
civilization in Cydonia Mensae

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.830 align:middle line:90%
and Cydonia chaos.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.307 align:middle line:84%
Near the coastlines,
those cities

00:13:10.307 --> 00:13:14.620 align:middle line:90%
of which we see the ruins.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Clearly for some people
who are sensitive.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:22.120 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mean like
psychically sensitive,

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:90%
you mean?

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Yes.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, right.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDY: And so they were
exploded from the atmosphere

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.560 align:middle line:90%
to make a maximum of damage.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.860 align:middle line:90%
So now--

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it essentially
fried the surface.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: No.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.030 align:middle line:84%
It blew up the
atmosphere of Mars.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:84%
This is happening 200 million
years ago, about 180-230,

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.150 align:middle line:90%
so I took the middle part.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it created
an arid landscape.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDY: It just made
Mars a dead planet.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.790 align:middle line:90%
It just exploded the atmosphere.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:07.240 align:middle line:84%
There is still a slight
atmosphere on Mars.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:13.570 align:middle line:84%
But at that time,
Mars was like Earth.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:18.340 align:middle line:84%
It was lush, full
of animal life.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:23.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean you had great
vegetation, of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.250 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to
ponder on is the fact

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:39.440 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
war between species,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.470 align:middle line:90%
alien of course, alien species.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some alien
species and whoever was on Mars.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDY: 200 million
years ago, it

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.300 align:middle line:84%
was so bad that
they destroyed not

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:57.330 align:middle line:84%
only a planet, but obviously
a civilization on that planet.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:01.810 align:middle line:84%
So this is a matter
for us to reflect.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
question becomes who?

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And you start looking for
repeated patterns and why.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Yes.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:16.570 align:middle line:84%
But this is very interesting
among all the incredible mind

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:23.550 align:middle line:84%
blowing information that we can
find in the Sumerian tablets,

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:28.150 align:middle line:84%
thanks to Zecharia Sitchin
who was able to make

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.940 align:middle line:90%
interesting translation.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, after
the new king of Palestine,

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:40.980 align:middle line:84%
one of the goddess, according
to the normal translation

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:90%
flew like a bird to Africa.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.490 align:middle line:84%
But according to
the understanding

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:53.310 align:middle line:84%
that a bird means a plane
just like American pilots

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.230 align:middle line:84%
they use I am taking
my bird to whatever.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.030 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:00.530 align:middle line:90%
It's the same in the tablets.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And so she flew in
her bird to Africa.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, in my
own esoteric training

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.950 align:middle line:84%
over the last 30
years, the beings that

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:13.900 align:middle line:84%
have been wonderful
teachers for me,

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.550 align:middle line:84%
when I asked them about some
odd placement of artifacts

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:84%
in the world which shouldn't
go with that era of history,

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.770 align:middle line:84%
they simply said, well, you
know there's always been flight

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:24.090 align:middle line:90%
until very recently.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And even then, there's
always been flight

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.820 align:middle line:84%
historically because we've
had advanced civilization-- we

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.140 align:middle line:90%
were in fact, at one time.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.270 align:middle line:84%
But we've had
advanced civilizations

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.790 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, really
almost from the beginning.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.736 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDY: Yes, well we have
mention of that in the old

00:16:38.736 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:90%
ancient--

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.640 align:middle line:84%
not only mythology, but
very important books.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Vedas,
as well, the Vimanas.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDY: [INAUDIBLE] in Egypt
with the flying machines.

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So in the Sumers, they had three
of types of flying machines.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.990 align:middle line:90%
They had the bird, normal bird.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Then they had the swirling
bird which is a helicopter.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And then they had
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:08.130 align:middle line:84%
that were the spacecraft,
interplanetary spacecraft.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interplanetary
spacecraft.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is all in
the Sumerian text.

00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Yes.

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.014 align:middle line:84%
At this point let me
ask you a quick question

00:17:15.014 --> 00:17:19.140 align:middle line:84%
as we're starting to bring
the story now to Earth.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.819 align:middle line:84%
Zecharia Sitchin
has been credited

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:84%
with the primary translations
of the Sumerian texts

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:84%
through the cylinders
and cuneiform.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.940 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing
and have done is

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:35.310 align:middle line:84%
you are using repeated
patterns in semantics.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:40.740 align:middle line:84%
How did you begin on that
path in analyzing more deeply

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.250 align:middle line:90%
into the translations?

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDY: Not the
translation but the analysis

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:50.120 align:middle line:90%
of the text, translated text.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:56.040 align:middle line:84%
I am going to make a very,
very quick parenthesis

00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.120 align:middle line:84%
to say that first of
all, I'm a meditator.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:05.250 align:middle line:84%
I have an inner path of
knowledge on the research.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:09.590 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also a researcher
in consciousness studies

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:14.120 align:middle line:84%
and I have been, since
ever, with doctoral thesis.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.070 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:84%
My first field of study
with parapsychology.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:24.330 align:middle line:84%
I was working in
preparing my thesis that I

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.930 align:middle line:90%
passed in France in ethnology.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.410 align:middle line:90%
So I am in between field.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And my original contribution
is the semantic field theory.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Because when you are
doing a lot of meditation

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and when you have some
sight, like I believe

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.390 align:middle line:90%
you do, and I have.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:90%
For me, it was impossible.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.340 align:middle line:84%
I was coming back from
about three years in India

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:84%
learning and learning on
myself, having been with masters

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:09.200 align:middle line:84%
in Sufi master, a
Hindu master, Tibetans,

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.790 align:middle line:90%
and remaining totally free.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:84%
But I had so a lot
of experiences.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And I knew perfectly
well since 18 years old

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:23.880 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is
an energy because I

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.810 align:middle line:84%
could see all kinds
of things some thing

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:32.520 align:middle line:84%
that were not only
mind on matter like--

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.260 align:middle line:90%


00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.390 align:middle line:84%
it's not only moving
object or healing

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:43.790 align:middle line:84%
for example, which is
bioPK, biopsychokinesis,

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.390 align:middle line:90%
but whatever you know.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Even with telepathy,
which is just

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.140 align:middle line:84%
communication at a distance
or clairvoyance, which to see

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.450 align:middle line:90%
things at the far distance.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were
capable across the board.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Yes.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were
clairvoyant, clairaudient.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Were you able to perform
like telekinesis?

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.972 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Also, healing also.

00:20:04.972 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Healing also.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:06.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Astral travel.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:84%
So you were experienced and
trained in all these realms.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Then, I get--

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Further education.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Yes.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.420 align:middle line:84%
First I do my masters
and I want to go further.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And I realize of course I
want to study consciousness.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And I realize that in the
field of cognitive psychology,

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:34.430 align:middle line:84%
all those sight capacities
are not even possible.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Cognitive psychology
doesn't acknowledge.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Why?

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Because consciousness
is supposedly

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:84%
only inside the brain,
inside the locale,

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:90%
the space and time of the brain.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So nothing can
happen at a distance.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And then, at that
moment, I decided

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to do a theory that
would explain site phenomenon

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:84%
on the wall of the
mind, body, psyche

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.895 align:middle line:90%
system, our consciousness.

00:21:09.895 --> 00:21:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A theory that
would explain consciousness

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.240 align:middle line:90%
at a distance so to speak?

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDY: Also.

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And also the capacity to get
into a meditative state, etc.,

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.520 align:middle line:84%
astral travel, everything
that I had experienced,

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.030 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to have a
theory that was coherent

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:31.070 align:middle line:90%
with those experiences.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a
semantic field theory.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And to make it very
short, apart from the fact

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:43.560 align:middle line:84%
that it can explain
what I said, it's

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:84%
a theory that
views consciousness

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:84%
as having a part embodied
in the body, related

00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:00.102 align:middle line:84%
to the neural level
to the body level.

00:22:00.102 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
The neurological level

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:90%
to the physical?

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But also part of
our consciousness,

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:13.700 align:middle line:84%
which Carl Jung is a great
psychologist, called the Self.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And all of the religions
called the Soul,

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:84%
this part of our
consciousness, from me,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.110 align:middle line:84%
already in semantic
field theory is

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.450 align:middle line:84%
a different dimension
of consciousness,

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.335 align:middle line:90%
which is beyond space and time.

00:22:31.335 --> 00:22:32.135 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:32.135 --> 00:22:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: And it has an energy
which is not matter energy,

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.460 align:middle line:84%
which is an energy
of consciousness,

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.630 align:middle line:84%
which is able to
interact with matter.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:50.110 align:middle line:84%
So when I applied this semantic
field theory to the Sumerian

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:58.640 align:middle line:84%
tablets, it enabled me to
see in a specific vocabulary

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.780 align:middle line:90%
or a part of a sentence.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:10.330 align:middle line:84%
I could see what were the
values and the behaviors on even

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:17.449 align:middle line:84%
the vocabulary, the kind
of way, I mean, ideal--

00:23:17.449 --> 00:23:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Almost a
temperament, even.

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: It's a
world temperament.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: So I was able
to decipher what I call

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:29.320 align:middle line:84%
the semantic field, the
whole consciousness of one

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.160 align:middle line:84%
of the protagonists and another
one to distinguish it with

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.700 align:middle line:90%
another one.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So it highlighted the
fact that some part where,

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.150 align:middle line:84%
much sounding much more
like the Sumerian tablets,

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:50.510 align:middle line:84%
like two or three million years
ago, because the Sumerians,

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:53.430 align:middle line:90%
it's very easy.

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.510 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
the same morality

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:58.282 align:middle line:84%
that we have at the
time of the patriarchy.

00:23:58.282 --> 00:23:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: They don't have
any problem with sexuality.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:07.210 align:middle line:90%
You have all types of sexuality.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:12.940 align:middle line:84%
The only crime in the
Sumerian civilization,

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:20.410 align:middle line:84%
the only crime is the
nom-willingness of somebody

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:22.960 align:middle line:90%
is rape.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Rape and murder,
whatever happens

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:33.590 align:middle line:84%
in between two adult that are
consented, mutually consented,

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:35.460 align:middle line:90%
is their problem.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.420 align:middle line:90%
And they change it.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:40.060 align:middle line:90%
They have no inhibitions.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:84%
You have all kind of
poems, almost sexual poems,

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.160 align:middle line:84%
the brother with the
sister, oh my dear.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this was depicted
at what point in our history,

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:50.060 align:middle line:90%
in the history of Mesopotamia?

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: We are talking about
basically the events in Sodom

00:24:54.620 --> 00:25:00.370 align:middle line:84%
and Gomorrah, which are also
described in the tablets.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Because practically
all the stories

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:10.120 align:middle line:84%
that are in the book of Genesis
are also in the tablets.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In Genesis,
and Sodom and Gomorrah

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:12.580 align:middle line:90%
is the story, right.

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in
the tablets, which

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.240 align:middle line:84%
are like 2 and 1/2
million year earlier,

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.580 align:middle line:90%
we have a family of God.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Those who came from
their nomad planet

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.622 align:middle line:90%
with King Anu on the planet.

00:25:26.622 --> 00:25:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: King Anu, OK.

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the first brother,
Enki, the sister, Ninmah,

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:40.360 align:middle line:84%
was a geneticist and the head
scientist in life sciences.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And only afterwards
came Enlil, who

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:48.250 align:middle line:84%
was the second brother,
the second prince.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And he was given the
rulership of Earth.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.575 align:middle line:84%
He had a very, very unstable
kind of personality.

00:25:56.575 --> 00:25:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Unstable, yes.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes, very unstable.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.160 align:middle line:90%


00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And he started making great
problems with young women

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:09.940 align:middle line:90%
when he was young.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.065 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He raped someone.

00:26:11.065 --> 00:26:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One of the Anunnaki.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This was
frowned upon, obviously.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.405 align:middle line:84%
Didn't he go before a
council to be judged?

00:26:18.405 --> 00:26:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes, exactly.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And he was nearly
exiled and lost

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.940 align:middle line:90%
his title of ruler of Earth.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And then, that was when
he was already on Earth.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Because it was one of the
Anunnaki students of Ninmah,

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:84%
the head scientist
in life sciences.

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So at
this time everything

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.644 align:middle line:84%
was permissible except
forced sexuality.

00:26:43.644 --> 00:26:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Except rape.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --rape.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: Which he
did, by the way.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:49.604 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:49.604 --> 00:26:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: So to get
back to the tablets,

00:26:54.040 --> 00:27:03.710 align:middle line:84%
it was very clear when you have
this highly moralistic style,

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:11.475 align:middle line:84%
and pushing the point
on the disobediencies--

00:27:11.475 --> 00:27:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The what?

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.504 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Disobedient.

00:27:13.504 --> 00:27:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Disobedient?

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: Disobedient, and
they have to punish them.

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you read
about the weapons

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:30.460 align:middle line:84%
they have, like the holy stone
that disintegrates whole, all.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.865 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Disintegrates?

00:27:31.865 --> 00:27:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:38.899 align:middle line:84%
The other one whose awesome
flash reaches to heave.

00:27:38.899 --> 00:27:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like laser
weapons, uh-huh.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Beams, the eyes that
penetrates all, the beams that

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:48.670 align:middle line:90%
can see everywhere.

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So these
texts are laced

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.260 align:middle line:84%
throughout with
descriptions of all these

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.820 align:middle line:84%
what we would call
high-tech weapons.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.005 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Oh yes, definitely.

00:27:56.005 --> 00:27:56.921 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, uh-huh.

00:27:56.921 --> 00:28:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: And of course, we
have the description of not only

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:05.360 align:middle line:84%
a very, very complex detailed
description of the assembly

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:10.570 align:middle line:84%
asking, specifically voting to
create a new species so that

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:15.670 align:middle line:84%
they would have workers
in the gold mines.

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And then asking Ninmah, the
head scientist in life sciences,

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.030 align:middle line:90%
to do the genetic engineering.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And Enki's saying at
that point yes, we

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:34.810 align:middle line:84%
are going to make a hybrid
with biped that I saw roaming

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:37.540 align:middle line:90%
in the jungles of Africa.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.156 align:middle line:84%
So it's very, very
clearly described.

00:28:40.156 --> 00:28:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
said they were

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.670 align:middle line:90%
beings that already exist here.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.670 align:middle line:84%
So they were going
hybridized some of their DNA.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And ideally,
some of their intelligence,

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.084 align:middle line:84%
by way of DNA, with the
human that was already here?

00:28:52.084 --> 00:28:53.125 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes, the biped.

00:28:53.125 --> 00:28:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, right.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: With the
humanoid biped.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And so we find in the
tablet, the same sentence,

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.650 align:middle line:84%
like, we will bind
a sense of life--

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:07.525 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Our genome.

00:29:07.525 --> 00:29:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Our genome--

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:84%
on the genome of the biped, on
this we will bind our image.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Our image?

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
comes in Genesis,

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.302 align:middle line:84%
we were made in the
likeness of God.

00:29:22.302 --> 00:29:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes yes, yes.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.218 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, let's talk
for a moment in this.

00:29:25.218 --> 00:29:27.940 align:middle line:84%
There was a council
initially, right?

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.950 align:middle line:90%
There was a council.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And then Anu, the god, Anu,
sent his sons, Enki and Enlil

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:35.050 align:middle line:90%
to Earth.

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:38.110 align:middle line:84%
He gave rulership of the Earth
to Enlil, the more unstable

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:39.250 align:middle line:90%
of the two.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:42.010 align:middle line:84%
One can only imagine
the politics that

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.180 align:middle line:90%
may have taken place there.

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:48.130 align:middle line:84%
But in this process,
Enlil chose to put himself

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.005 align:middle line:90%
as the one and only God.

00:29:50.005 --> 00:29:51.352 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes, at one point.

00:29:51.352 --> 00:29:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At one point?

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.713 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
critical to the story,

00:29:54.713 --> 00:29:57.680 align:middle line:90%
as it unfolds into our history.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: This is
going in phases.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Because first he's
the ruler of Earth

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and he's abusing his
power all the time.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Abusing power?

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: Yeah, he's
starting to become upset with

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.720 align:middle line:90%
the new-created earthlings.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He said they're
becoming too much like "them."

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:15.540 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: That he's afraid that
we are going to, first of all,

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.080 align:middle line:84%
he's afraid that we are going
to get too knowledgeable.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:31.660 align:middle line:84%
He's afraid that we
will overwhelm them.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.880 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
point was when

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:40.790 align:middle line:84%
he tried for a long, long
period to destroy humanity.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:42.140 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:46.540 align:middle line:90%
Because he was a despot.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:50.535 align:middle line:84%
And Anunnaki, who were
not royal family, who

00:30:50.535 --> 00:30:55.055 align:middle line:84%
were working in the mines in
Africa, in the South Africa.

00:30:55.055 --> 00:30:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:31:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: Those revolted because
they were not able to have

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:01.900 align:middle line:90%
wives.

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.857 align:middle line:90%
They were working too hard.

00:31:03.857 --> 00:31:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were
being treated abusively.

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:09.000 align:middle line:10%
>> HARDY: Yes. so at that
point is when the Assembly

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.330 align:middle line:10%
of the Gods decided to
vote to make a new species.

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:15.747 align:middle line:84%
But then there was
a second revolt

00:31:15.747 --> 00:31:21.560 align:middle line:84%
with Marduk, the
first born of Enki,

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:30.420 align:middle line:84%
was the one to head space port
and all the space activity.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.060 align:middle line:90%
They had the space base on Mars.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Because when they came and they
stop on Mars to take the water,

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.260 align:middle line:90%
they started building a base.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And Marduk, the firstborn
of Enki, for humanity,

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:52.760 align:middle line:84%
finally married an
earthling, the daughter

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:57.750 align:middle line:84%
of a high priestess
that he loved a lot.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So Marduk was the head
of all the Igigi, was

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:03.310 align:middle line:90%
the special note.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Those who turn and observe
on the orbiting station,

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:14.990 align:middle line:84%
on a space station on Mars,
and so this is Marduk.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Marduk was the God of Babylon.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:22.335 align:middle line:84%
But at one point, the
Igigi, the space--

00:32:22.335 --> 00:32:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Space people.

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: --space people, they
revolt because they are always

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.440 align:middle line:84%
on the base on Mars,
on a base on the moon,

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.270 align:middle line:84%
on the orbiting station,
on the space port.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And they have no right, they
no place to come on Earth.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To be at home.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.530 align:middle line:84%
On vacation, they have
no wives because there

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:47.120 align:middle line:90%
are so few Anunnaki women.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And so they revolt. And they
decide that the next time King

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Anu and Queen Antu will
come to Earth for a visit.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And everybody will be invited,
it will be a feast everywhere,

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:05.620 align:middle line:90%
including for the earthling.

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.140 align:middle line:90%
And they will be invited.

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.210 align:middle line:90%
They will come to Earth.

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Then they will choose
whatever wife they want.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.850 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what is
in the book of Genesis.

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And yes, the Gods married
the daughters of men.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:27.110 align:middle line:84%
So we have Enki, who
was more moral and just

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:30.220 align:middle line:90%
in his treatment of humanity.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And we have Enlil, who's the
boss, who is a psychopath,

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:34.880 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And now they start procreating
with women of the Earth.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:42.713 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: No, this the Igigi.

00:33:42.713 --> 00:33:44.160 align:middle line:90%
This is the Igigi.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I was
telling the story.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: Is that at that moment
this part of the Anunnakis,

00:33:55.790 --> 00:34:00.790 align:middle line:84%
the space people,
they chose a wife.

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:01.900 align:middle line:90%
They married them.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.340 align:middle line:90%
They had children.

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is what starts the fact
that Enlil, the ruler of Earth,

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.635 align:middle line:84%
is now absolutely
upset with humanity.

00:34:11.635 --> 00:34:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they're
coming along too quickly?

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: No.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Because he believes
that we, the Earthlings,

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:24.320 align:middle line:84%
are spoiling the bloodline,
the Anunnaki bloodline.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, because we're
bringing down their blood.

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes, OK, gotcha.

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: And you have
this, very strangely.

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:33.949 align:middle line:84%
And I come back to
semantic filter theory

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:40.330 align:middle line:84%
to show you you have, very
quickly, in the Bible,

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:47.179 align:middle line:84%
in between the deluge and
the fact that humanity now

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:52.899 align:middle line:84%
was considered, by the deity of
the Bible, to have "no soul."

00:34:52.899 --> 00:34:53.699 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No soul.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:55.594 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: No soul, to be only--

00:34:55.594 --> 00:34:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Animal, basically.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Animal.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And then, at one
point, in the text

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:11.030 align:middle line:84%
you have that they are going
to become as we are, you know?

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Or you have the little
sentence and the Son of God

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:24.710 align:middle line:84%
took, in the earthling,
whichever wives they wanted.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So we have small
parts of sentences

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:35.260 align:middle line:84%
that are from the
Sumerian tablets, what

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:38.890 align:middle line:84%
we can find in the Sumerian
tablets, the real history

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:40.900 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And in the Bible or in
the book of Genesis,

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:50.590 align:middle line:84%
it is in the middle of
sentences that are moralistic,

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:53.500 align:middle line:84%
which I call
moralistic, and which

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:57.570 align:middle line:84%
are putting the blame
constantly on Earthling.

00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:00.370 align:middle line:84%
While in the tablets,
the same thing

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:02.980 align:middle line:84%
are recounted, the
revolt of Igigi,

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:05.830 align:middle line:90%
the revolt of the mine workers.

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:09.010 align:middle line:84%
But there is no blame
on the earthling.

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Because how could we, the
poor little ones, not even--

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:16.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the Igigi were giants.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.240 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.900 align:middle line:84%
If they want to get a wife,
it's not the poor earthling

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:22.095 align:middle line:90%
who is going to say--

00:36:22.095 --> 00:36:24.553 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I've tried to
imagine that just physically.

00:36:24.553 --> 00:36:26.160 align:middle line:84%
But in any event,
on one hand, they're

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:29.350 align:middle line:84%
blaming us for diluting the
quality of their bloodline.

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And on the other, they're
angry because they say we're

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.750 align:middle line:90%
becoming too much like them.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: Yes,
too knowledgeable.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Too knowledgeable.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:36.445 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Too strong.

00:36:36.445 --> 00:36:36.995 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:36.995 --> 00:36:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
have both going on.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:41.674 align:middle line:84%
So you have this extreme
resentment of humanity

00:36:41.674 --> 00:36:42.474 align:middle line:90%
by Enlil.

00:36:42.474 --> 00:36:43.499 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Only by Enlil.

00:36:43.499 --> 00:36:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: By Enlil, yeah.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: All the
time, from the time,

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.170 align:middle line:84%
you have to remember
that Ninmah,

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:50.916 align:middle line:84%
the head scientist
in life science--

00:36:50.916 --> 00:36:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The sister.

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: --she was living
with her half brother, Enki.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Both of them always
wanted to teach humanity.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:04.780 align:middle line:84%
They were the one to start
the esoteric knowledge.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:10.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were
giving us sciences.

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Enki started the first
university, the Sage of Eridu,

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:22.019 align:middle line:90%
and Noah was learning with Enki.

00:37:22.019 --> 00:37:23.185 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was a high priest.

00:37:23.185 --> 00:37:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And Enki and Ninmah, other
one, to always help humanity,

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:33.100 align:middle line:84%
want humanity to
be knowledgeable,

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:36.501 align:middle line:84%
to be able to keep
going, to pursue--

00:37:36.501 --> 00:37:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To continue
evolving, yes.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: Yes, the civilization,
once they are gone.

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And they are the one to give us
all the tablets, the knowledge

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.940 align:middle line:90%
in a very clear form.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
interestingly, your

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:56.140 align:middle line:84%
write in the book with
Enlil, for example,

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.700 align:middle line:84%
they weren't particularly
intuitive beings.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:37:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: No.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't
have that connection

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:02.470 align:middle line:90%
that human beings have.

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: No.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.157 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
spirituality as we know it.

00:38:06.157 --> 00:38:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No spirituality.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:14.920 align:middle line:84%
They would draw lots and go to
oracles to ascertain direction

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:15.720 align:middle line:90%
for their future.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That species
didn't have that.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: There were also, of
course looking at astronomy

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:23.140 align:middle line:90%
a lot.

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:27.720 align:middle line:84%
But whenever their
own judgment failed--

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:31.515 align:middle line:84%
and we have to remember that
they were a human species,

00:38:31.515 --> 00:38:33.475 align:middle line:90%
a royal family.

00:38:33.475 --> 00:38:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A what family?

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Royal, with a king.

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A royal human species?

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And they decided, at one point,
to become the God's force

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:51.880 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted to
give kingship to humanity.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So they started the
kings and the queen,

00:38:54.180 --> 00:39:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and notably, the 10
kings until Noah,

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:05.340 align:middle line:84%
that was done by Ninmah,
even before the deluge.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so even
before the deluge.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.270 align:middle line:84%
So let's focus on
Enlil, because he really

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.459 align:middle line:84%
seems to be the one that has
impressed our societies most

00:39:13.459 --> 00:39:16.000 align:middle line:84%
today, even with the election
of someone like Trump, I mean--

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:21.595 align:middle line:84%
So Enlil, instead of
going from a council where

00:39:21.595 --> 00:39:24.820 align:middle line:84%
there are men and women,
now we have a solo male god.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And he proclaims himself
as God over everyone.

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And he demands loyalty
from the people

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.830 align:middle line:84%
that follow him, his
"chosen" ones, which

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:36.340 align:middle line:84%
are the people he hand-selected
to take into the priesthood,

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and to carry out
his own agendas.

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Noah was one of
these people that

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:43.210 align:middle line:84%
was a chosen person of
the Anunnaki, right?

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Mhm.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But who was
that, by Enki, by Marduk?

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: Oh, let me say
something very, very important.

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: It's that when one
of the god becomes a chief

00:39:55.450 --> 00:40:00.580 align:middle line:84%
of the gods, but also when
Enlil decide, at one point,

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:04.770 align:middle line:84%
to become the sole god,
and they wanted, now,

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:08.830 align:middle line:84%
the religion to forget
about the world family.

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:15.036 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody's crutch,
the mother, the father,

00:40:15.036 --> 00:40:17.950 align:middle line:84%
the royal family,
the other Anunnaki.

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:21.780 align:middle line:84%
So they become now either
the enemies, so the devils,

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.370 align:middle line:84%
or they become the
angels if they were

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:25.640 align:middle line:90%
in the first clan of Enlil--

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.848 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they're not
part of the original ruling

00:40:27.848 --> 00:40:29.436 align:middle line:90%
family or tribe, or circle?

00:40:29.436 --> 00:40:30.815 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: They do, They do, yes.

00:40:30.815 --> 00:40:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I
mean, in history.

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:34.609 align:middle line:84%
He changes history
at this point.

00:40:34.609 --> 00:40:35.900 align:middle line:90%
He paints a different portrait.

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: But you have to
understand that when two angels

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:46.160 align:middle line:84%
were sent to destroy Sodom,
they were just the son

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.500 align:middle line:90%
or the nephew, you know?

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:49.885 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: These were feuds.

00:40:49.885 --> 00:40:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's the point I'm
trying to get to here.

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:56.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to
the Pre-Diluvian times

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:57.590 align:middle line:90%
and what happened.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: Let me
talk about Noah.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.710 align:middle line:90%
Noah is very interesting.

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a line of king
that has been started by Ninmah

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:12.410 align:middle line:84%
in her own town,
[INAUDIBLE],, and the 10th--

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:15.860 align:middle line:84%
like we have the 10th
Patriarch in the Bible,

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:19.487 align:middle line:84%
we have the 10 Kings and
Queens-- that's a difference--

00:41:19.487 --> 00:41:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Different.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: --in [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.150 align:middle line:90%
And then Noah is the 10th.

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:28.370 align:middle line:90%
So he is already immensely old.

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Because at the
beginning, humanity,

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.485 align:middle line:84%
we have an extremely
lengthy life.

00:41:38.485 --> 00:41:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: Like the Anunnaki,
not exactly like them,

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:44.797 align:middle line:90%
but nearly so.

00:41:44.797 --> 00:41:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were called semi.

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:48.980 align:middle line:84%
The Anunnaki were semi,
considered semi-immortal,

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.125 align:middle line:90%
they lived so long.

00:41:50.125 --> 00:41:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: And so Noah
is a disciple of Enki.

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And Enlil is trying to erase
humanity, first with pandemia,

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.480 align:middle line:90%
then with famine.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's talk
about that for a moment.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.170 align:middle line:84%
First, essentially,
there was drought

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:10.200 align:middle line:90%
and people were starved.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he
attempted to alter--

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and you say this in the book
and we know this exists today.

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.440 align:middle line:84%
They had the technology
to alter weather patterns.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So the first track
is alter the weather

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.620 align:middle line:84%
into a drought scenario
for a long period of time,

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.650 align:middle line:84%
to starve out humanity and get
rid of them that way, right?

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Then the deluge?

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Then there was--

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that was the last one.

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:37.160 align:middle line:90%
There was pandemia first.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.060 align:middle line:90%
Some terrible illnesses.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Diseases.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: And at the point where
people were going to really

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:51.680 align:middle line:84%
die, Enlil is realizing that
there are still earthling.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.350 align:middle line:90%
How is it still possible?

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So he convened an
Assembly of the Gods,

00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:02.290 align:middle line:84%
on the eve of-- of course they
want to be the most powerful

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:04.152 align:middle line:90%
and to bend arms.

00:43:04.152 --> 00:43:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And they say to Enki,
what's happening?

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:09.680 align:middle line:84%
How is it that your
people are not dying?

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.780 align:middle line:84%
How is it that we still have
earthling all around while they

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:16.900 align:middle line:90%
are sullying our bloodline?

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sullying
our bloodline, yes.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
he says, well, I

00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:29.360 align:middle line:84%
had to ask this God
to stop the rain.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:34.490 align:middle line:84%
I had to ask this God to
stop the crops from growing.

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:37.515 align:middle line:84%
I had asked you to
stop the people,

00:43:37.515 --> 00:43:40.670 align:middle line:84%
to block the access
to the ocean.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:43.187 align:middle line:84%
So that the people cannot
even go on the fish.

00:43:43.187 --> 00:43:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cannot eat fish.

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Can't eat the fish.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
in the assembly,

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:51.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is so all details,
this is very interesting.

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Enlil starts laughing.

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And he says, do you really
mean that you are asking

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:03.710 align:middle line:90%
me to kill my own people?

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And he was the one,
Enki and Ninmah

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:08.460 align:middle line:84%
were the ones to
create humanity.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Enlil just ask the first
couple, Adam [INAUDIBLE],,

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:16.954 align:middle line:84%
to come to Sumer where he
made the garden, to have them.

00:44:16.954 --> 00:44:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The first couple,
that's the Adam and Eve story.

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
we were forbidden

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.365 align:middle line:84%
to do this and that,
and certainly naked.

00:44:23.365 --> 00:44:27.740 align:middle line:84%
While we were not naked
with Enki and Ninmah.

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And now, so at this
assembly, Enki is loving.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
Gods, again, as usual,

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:43.245 align:middle line:84%
give precedence to
Enlil and go with him.

00:44:43.245 --> 00:44:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And now Enlil say, OK,
I have another plan.

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Because some scientists have
predicted that a huge wave--

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tsunami.

00:44:55.970 --> 00:45:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: --the tsunami was
going to go over Earth and kill

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:02.675 align:middle line:90%
everybody.

00:45:02.675 --> 00:45:06.122 align:middle line:84%
And we are going
to save ourselves.

00:45:06.122 --> 00:45:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Eyes are going back to Nibiru
or going in spacecraft.

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they
had the space port.

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:11.315 align:middle line:84%
So they could go
wherever they wanted.

00:45:11.315 --> 00:45:12.115 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:45:12.115 --> 00:45:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So they were, in fact, orbiting
the earth for the long length

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:17.820 align:middle line:90%
of time of the deluge.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And he is the one
to ask everybody

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:25.250 align:middle line:84%
not to tell the earthling that
the deluge is going to happen.

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:27.045 align:middle line:90%
So that they would be all dead.

00:45:27.045 --> 00:45:28.295 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All wiped out, yeah.

00:45:28.295 --> 00:45:28.685 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:45:28.685 --> 00:45:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As far as they knew,
from that area of the world,

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:32.167 align:middle line:90%
they would all be dead.

00:45:32.167 --> 00:45:33.000 align:middle line:90%
That was his desire.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes, yes.

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And then he's upset
when he sees Noah.

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Because of course, it was
Enki giving to Noah the plans.

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So you see the
problem when you go

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:49.600 align:middle line:84%
from a family of
human aliens that

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.880 align:middle line:84%
have created a new
humanity, and then

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:59.120 align:middle line:84%
you want to force this
story into a one-god story,

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.470 align:middle line:84%
then of course you have
some problems accompanied.

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And an
angry god that was

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:05.720 align:middle line:84%
angry with humans, that
tried to destroy them that

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:09.020 align:middle line:84%
caused pestilence, flood,
and everything else,

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:11.880 align:middle line:84%
to make the human
feel subservient.

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, for example,
in the Sumerian tablets,

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Satan is Enki.

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:middle line:84%
We have the serpent, because
it was his honorific title.

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Like his own blame was the
snakes, the double snake.

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:34.280 align:middle line:84%
His emblem, the caduceus,
will go to his son.

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the caduceus,
the serpent was wisdom.

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:38.780 align:middle line:90%
It always represented wisdom.

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes, yes.

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was for
high-ranking knowledge.

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you look, I
could not be astonished.

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:50.120 align:middle line:84%
I've never read
the Bible before I

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:56.260 align:middle line:84%
started to really analyze it,
the book of Genesis, at least.

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:59.360 align:middle line:90%
And I could not believe it.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:03.270 align:middle line:84%
When I started,
reading is not enough.

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:07.085 align:middle line:84%
You have to go in depth
and analyze and see

00:47:07.085 --> 00:47:09.950 align:middle line:84%
this group of word and
then this group of word.

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:14.490 align:middle line:84%
In a sentence, for example,
you have definitely the god,

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:15.290 align:middle line:90%
Elohim.

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:16.950 align:middle line:90%
And then you have Yahweh.

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And the new king of
Sodom and Gomorrah,

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:28.850 align:middle line:84%
you have the gods, plural,
send the brimstone and other,

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:35.180 align:middle line:84%
destroys the cities that
upset the Lord with--

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:37.380 align:middle line:84%
excuse me, it's
not word by word--

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:41.796 align:middle line:84%
with brimstone that
came from Yahweh.

00:47:41.796 --> 00:47:44.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's not the same subject.

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:45.920 align:middle line:90%
And you have two subjects.

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So you have a distinction
between the Gods.

00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:51.470 align:middle line:90%
And Yahweh is another person.

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
again, all of these wars,

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.690 align:middle line:84%
all of these stories
in the Bible,

00:47:56.690 --> 00:48:00.530 align:middle line:84%
had to do with factions who
simply were not loyal to Enlil.

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And so they're cast in
the role of the bad guys.

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:07.050 align:middle line:84%
So these acts are of a wrathful,
petulant, psychopathic god

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:10.820 align:middle line:84%
that's simply hell bent
on destroying humanity.

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:13.400 align:middle line:90%
So you have the story of Noah.

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And Noah, it sounds
like Noah was

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:20.330 align:middle line:84%
helped by Marduk, that
helped Noah to gather

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:23.990 align:middle line:84%
not only whatever you might
consider as food sources

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:26.780 align:middle line:84%
or seeds for the future, but
also knowledge, that books

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:28.670 align:middle line:90%
and such were taken as well.

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And they were also taken up, it
sounds like, taken into space.

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:33.470 align:middle line:84%
So there was knowledge
that was saved.

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:35.150 align:middle line:84%
There were foodstuffs
that were saved,

00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:38.210 align:middle line:84%
species that were
saved during this, not

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:40.020 align:middle line:90%
at the hands of Enlil, however.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.620 align:middle line:90%
So that didn't work.

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Here's humanity.

00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:45.180 align:middle line:90%
Voila.

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:45.980 align:middle line:90%
We're back, right?

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:46.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.330 align:middle line:84%
So now let's enter
nuclear weapons.

00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we only have
about 10 minutes left.

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Nuclear weapons,
what happened there?

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Because that's really
an atrocious story.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:49:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: This is the
most horrible story.

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to
get into psychology

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:09.030 align:middle line:84%
and realize that when
we were young, all of us

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Christian people, we were told
that Sodom was a great sin,

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.520 align:middle line:90%
sexual sin of homosexuality.

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And now, you know,
I'm a psychologist

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.260 align:middle line:84%
and I look at the
translation of the tablets.

00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And I see that in
the tablets, this

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:31.410 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely nothing like it.

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:33.685 align:middle line:90%
So Just his enemies.

00:49:33.685 --> 00:49:34.485 align:middle line:90%
They were enemies.

00:49:34.485 --> 00:49:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: As usual, you have to
dig very deeply into the text,

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:42.320 align:middle line:90%
having the tablets in mind.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you will
recover one part

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:50.580 align:middle line:84%
of a sentence that is truly
saying what the tablets have

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:53.180 align:middle line:90%
been saying all along.

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:57.490 align:middle line:84%
Namely, in the Bible, you
have the War of the Kings.

00:49:57.490 --> 00:50:02.260 align:middle line:84%
The War of the Kings, as
Abraham says it very clearly--

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Abraham.

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: Abraham
says it at one point.

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And he says he's not
going to get into it.

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:14.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a house of
Nannar son of Enlil.

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Against house of
Marduk, son of Enki.

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.610 align:middle line:90%
And he's talking strangely.

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:25.380 align:middle line:90%
Nannar was against his father.

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:28.950 align:middle line:84%
He was with Inanna, the
granddaughter Enlil,

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:35.060 align:middle line:84%
the great goddess of
the matriarchal era.

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And the warmonger, I mean,
she was the one terribly doing

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.670 align:middle line:90%
all kind of wars.

00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the King of the east,
Nanna and Inanna, the Gods,

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:55.410 align:middle line:84%
of course, they play
with the earthling kings

00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:57.450 align:middle line:90%
to send them this on Earth.

00:50:57.450 --> 00:51:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And Abraham stopped them
from getting into the Sinai

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:12.370 align:middle line:84%
spaceport, where son of Marduk,
Nabu, on Marduk himself,

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:13.170 align:middle line:90%
they were.

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:15.381 align:middle line:90%
But it was also a sacred space.

00:51:15.381 --> 00:51:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why did
Abraham try to stop them

00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:18.379 align:middle line:90%
from getting to the spaceport?

00:51:18.379 --> 00:51:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: He was told by his god
to stop the advance of the King

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:25.890 align:middle line:90%
of the East.

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:29.370 align:middle line:90%
But not in a war-like way.

00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Even it was Pharaoh in Egypt
he went, with his wife.

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.670 align:middle line:90%
And Abraham was a Sumerian.

00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:43.030 align:middle line:84%
His wife-- it's in the
Bible-- was his sister.

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And he is given by the
Pharaoh, a cavalry of camels,

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and he's going to stop
the Kings of the East

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:55.860 align:middle line:90%
very near the Sinai.

00:51:55.860 --> 00:52:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Then, only 16 years later,
you know, there is a new--

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:07.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Marduk is constantly
rebuilding his temple

00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:09.240 align:middle line:90%
in Babylon, so Babel tower.

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.930 align:middle line:90%


00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:17.200 align:middle line:84%
They are both, all the clan of
Enki, Enki's sons, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Marduk's are all
incredible scientists.

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:21.060 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:29.770 align:middle line:84%
So he had the highest
technology, all this.

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And he's always
rebuilding his temple.

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And again, the Assembly
of the Gods send Nergal.

00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:39.990 align:middle line:90%
He's the youngest son of Enki.

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:42.280 align:middle line:90%
And he's totally neurotic.

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:46.015 align:middle line:84%
And he's the one with son
of Enlil, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:52:46.015 --> 00:52:51.390 align:middle line:84%
who are going to pour
the nukes on Sumer.

00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:55.920 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the whole
story of the new King

00:52:55.920 --> 00:53:00.110 align:middle line:84%
of Sodom and Gomorrah,
in the Sumerian tablets,

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:04.860 align:middle line:84%
it's only they are
trying to kill Marduk.

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:07.770 align:middle line:84%
It's the first time they
tried to kill an Anunnaki.

00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:10.106 align:middle line:84%
And it has been decided
by the Assembly.

00:53:10.106 --> 00:53:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They have to
ready because Marduk

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:14.175 align:middle line:90%
is in league with humanity.

00:53:14.175 --> 00:53:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So they want him gone.

00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes, always, yes.

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:21.690 align:middle line:84%
So they new King Sodom because
they think Marduk is there.

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:26.060 align:middle line:84%
They don't care about the
human population, our humanity.

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:28.440 align:middle line:84%
However, it says
in the tablet, it

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:32.910 align:middle line:84%
took me a while to
understand, that Anu,

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:36.880 align:middle line:84%
when they decide
that they are voting

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.770 align:middle line:84%
for the use of the nukes
against Marduk and Nabu

00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:46.120 align:middle line:84%
in Palestine and on the
Sinai, Anu says, oh,

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.860 align:middle line:84%
but I want the
population to be spared.

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And they said, but this is
so ridiculous, so stupid.

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it means they
did not know anything

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:56.170 align:middle line:90%
about nuclear weapons.

00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they use them in
several areas, not just there,

00:53:58.780 --> 00:53:59.060 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:53:59.060 --> 00:53:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:04.840 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is that the
population he was talking about

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:10.120 align:middle line:84%
were only the space people
that were inside the space

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:12.340 align:middle line:90%
facility in the Sinai.

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:16.540 align:middle line:84%
So because after in the
tablet it says, and the Gods,

00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:18.430 align:middle line:90%
they had to flee.

00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:21.730 align:middle line:84%
They nuked the place, and
they destroy the place.

00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:23.980 align:middle line:84%
One time they
destroy the mountain.

00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:25.660 align:middle line:84%
One time they
destroys the plain.

00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Then they destroy the
cities of the la, la, la.

00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:30.140 align:middle line:90%
This is in the tablets.

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And they say, and they made
the gods flee from the Sinai.

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now, so
the gods have fled.

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:41.080 align:middle line:84%
They've nuked a number of
cities in regions and the people

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.480 align:middle line:90%
with it, everything with it.

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Abraham is still central
to this story, right?

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:48.190 align:middle line:90%
Because Abraham was spared.

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:49.770 align:middle line:90%
And they said, OK--

00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: But not
his nephew, Lot.

00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:53.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not his nephew, Lot.

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:57.440 align:middle line:84%
But you can if you
can find 10 good men,

00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.970 align:middle line:84%
he could have 10
good men with him.

00:54:58.970 --> 00:54:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: Yes.

00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that means Abraham
was in league with this plan.

00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:04.900 align:middle line:84%
He knew what was going
to happen, right?

00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: This is a great
problem and it's very complex.

00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: And I would say
that you have to read through

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:15.650 align:middle line:90%
slowly, you know?

00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:18.461 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was he aware
that the population was

00:55:18.461 --> 00:55:19.960 align:middle line:84%
going to be destroyed
and that's why

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:20.870 align:middle line:90%
he was asked to gather people?

00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>> HARDY: No.

00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:25.300 align:middle line:84%
He was, in the Bible
text, he was really

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:28.110 align:middle line:90%
trying to lessen the damage.

00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:32.800 align:middle line:84%
However, the whole
story between Lot, this

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:39.680 align:middle line:84%
is another story, a very,
very long, long time after.

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are at
least three phases

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:45.657 align:middle line:84%
in the writing of
the Book of Genesis.

00:55:45.657 --> 00:55:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very different phases.

00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:47.790 align:middle line:90%
Different authors.

00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: An adult phase, which
is a kind of moral tale that

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.580 align:middle line:90%
does not stand up.

00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:55.920 align:middle line:90%
It's full of contradictions.

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:55:56.830 --> 00:56:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: I mean, it's like the
angels say that the gods want

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:03.310 align:middle line:90%
to save Lot.

00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:05.150 align:middle line:90%
They have not found 10 people.

00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:07.630 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, only
Lot's family was

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:10.300 align:middle line:90%
Mars was [INAUDIBLE] people.

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Then they send Lot to the place
they are going to nuke next.

00:56:14.090 --> 00:56:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: Zoara, the town
of Zoara, which I mean,

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.690 align:middle line:90%
Abraham was in Hebron.

00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:25.680 align:middle line:90%
This was happening in Sodom.

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So Sodom, they
send him to Zoara,

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:32.710 align:middle line:84%
which is in the mountain,
to the east about 30 miles.

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, Abraham is only
50 miles to the north.

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:40.120 align:middle line:90%
And he has a camel cavalry.

00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And 16 years earlier
he made all the way

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:49.015 align:middle line:84%
to Damascus at top speed
to save the same Lot.

00:56:49.015 --> 00:56:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I guess
the question becomes,

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.550 align:middle line:84%
if people are looking at
this, was Abraham aware

00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:57.040 align:middle line:84%
that the destruction
via nuclear weapons

00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.410 align:middle line:90%
was going to take place at all?

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:04.930 align:middle line:84%
If he was aware, did he have
the opportunity, the choice

00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:08.140 align:middle line:90%
to rescue Lot or not?

00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:09.350 align:middle line:90%
Or did he choose not to?

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Or was he not told
what was going on?

00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: The real problem
with the whole story of Sodom

00:57:15.730 --> 00:57:18.480 align:middle line:90%
and Gomorrah is twofold.

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:22.630 align:middle line:84%
The first one is
the fact that it

00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:29.070 align:middle line:84%
was purely a war of the clan of
Enlil against the clan of Enki

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:30.530 align:middle line:90%
and Marduk.

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And they nuke a city
without any problem,

00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:41.480 align:middle line:84%
knowing that they were going
to erase the population.

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Then the second problem
is the rendering

00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:54.160 align:middle line:84%
of this historical story into
a one-god patriarchal type

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:59.710 align:middle line:84%
of text where there
is no historical wars

00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:01.220 align:middle line:90%
between brothers.

00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And the brother has
become Satan, the devil,

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:08.380 align:middle line:84%
while he was a great
knowledge snake, Enki.

00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:09.670 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:11.545 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he becomes
more of a devil, OK.

00:58:11.545 --> 00:58:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: And the story with
Abraham is not standing on its

00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:18.940 align:middle line:90%
own when you really look at it.

00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:20.620 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't make any sense.

00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Because Lot is sent, by Gods'
mercy, is sent with his family

00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:32.200 align:middle line:84%
to the town in the east in
the mountains, which is going

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:35.110 align:middle line:90%
to be nuked next, the same day.

00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:39.887 align:middle line:84%
Because when Abraham is
awakening in the morning,

00:58:39.887 --> 00:58:40.720 align:middle line:90%
he sees the furnace.

00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.886 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He sees the smoke.

00:58:41.886 --> 00:58:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: Meanwhile, at
dawn, Lot is sent to Zoara,

00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And the furnace was already more
than one town, more than Sodom.

00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So instead of going
north, just let's

00:58:55.790 --> 00:59:05.870 align:middle line:84%
say, 1/3 of the way longer was
Abraham, his father, you know?

00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:08.180 align:middle line:90%
It had been his father.

00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And also, he was going to be
the heir as a high priest.

00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:16.225 align:middle line:84%
Because the father of Abraham
was a Sumerian high priest.

00:59:16.225 --> 00:59:18.335 align:middle line:90%
And Abraham was a high priest.

00:59:18.335 --> 00:59:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And he was going to
be a high priest--

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:22.063 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Lot was going
to be a high priest.

00:59:22.063 --> 00:59:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: --before Abraham
has some kids of his own.

00:59:26.790 --> 00:59:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, it
doesn't make sense

00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:33.440 align:middle line:84%
that Abraham, who
had saved Lot, he

00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.400 align:middle line:84%
had gone all the way to
Damascus with his cavalry,

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:44.570 align:middle line:84%
just to save Lot, his heir, and
the next high priest in line.

00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:45.760 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And then he's not
going now to save Lot,

00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:51.410 align:middle line:90%
which is just 40 miles away.

00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:54.640 align:middle line:90%
Damascus is 160 miles.

00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:57.180 align:middle line:90%
And so it doesn't make sense.

00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, already Lot'
family was 10 people.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:04.650 align:middle line:84%
So normally, the town
should not have been done.

01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:07.577 align:middle line:90%
And there are a lot of problems.

01:00:07.577 --> 01:00:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is
hard to patch together.

01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:11.570 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that
continues, if we

01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:15.350 align:middle line:84%
look at it from a biblical text,
the story of Abraham and Isaac.

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:20.390 align:middle line:84%
He was willing to kill
his son to please his god.

01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:24.620 align:middle line:84%
What kind of God would
ever A, ask such a thing

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:26.360 align:middle line:90%
except a psychopathic god?

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.400 align:middle line:84%
That's not a god that
we would recognize

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.090 align:middle line:84%
as something that's giving
and loving and educative,

01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:33.240 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:38.294 align:middle line:84%
So that was already in
him, to honor that god.

01:00:38.294 --> 01:00:39.335 align:middle line:90%
And we have no time left.

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:40.540 align:middle line:90%
We're over.

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:44.120 align:middle line:84%
From there, we split into
the Abrahamic traditions,

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.460 align:middle line:84%
the patriarchy
starts taking hold.

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:47.910 align:middle line:90%
And tell that in one minute.

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:49.236 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:00:49.236 --> 01:00:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: Well, so one minute
would be that strangely,

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:05.360 align:middle line:84%
the Hebrew text, in my opinion,
was written with the story

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:09.800 align:middle line:84%
of one god in order
to educate the people.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.380 align:middle line:84%
But it was done at
a specific time,

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:15.050 align:middle line:84%
which was already a
time where sexuality

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:17.460 align:middle line:90%
was already condemned.

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:18.359 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:01:18.359 --> 01:01:19.650 align:middle line:90%
Females were already sidelined.

01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:22.085 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: Women were
totally subdued.

01:01:22.085 --> 01:01:22.905 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:01:22.905 --> 01:01:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: And obviously, Enlil
had always been against women,

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
against everybody, his
wife, he had raped.

01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:37.160 align:middle line:90%
He finally married with her.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.870 align:middle line:90%
So he saved his title.

01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
anything that was

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:47.200 align:middle line:84%
done, at that
point in the story,

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:51.335 align:middle line:84%
those specific stories,
that were like, really

01:01:51.335 --> 01:02:02.559 align:middle line:84%
a shock for us, it was done
to make the humanity fear God.

01:02:02.559 --> 01:02:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And they thought
that they were going

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:14.020 align:middle line:84%
to educate humanity by
fear, by using the lash

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:17.750 align:middle line:84%
and to put all the
fault on the woman,

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:19.970 align:middle line:90%
also, on the men and the women.

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It sidelined what
humanity was capable of.

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.720 align:middle line:84%
It sidelined, even, our
intuitive processes and ability

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.060 align:middle line:84%
to connect beyond where
they were able to connect,

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and basically made humans and
women, in particular, small,

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:35.670 align:middle line:84%
and raised the patriarchy
alongside it, right

01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:36.470 align:middle line:90%
to this very day.

01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: But this is why we can
liberate ourselves by getting

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:44.235 align:middle line:84%
into those real histories
of what happened.

01:02:44.235 --> 01:02:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

01:02:45.110 --> 01:02:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, we've only
touched on like, not even

01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:51.047 align:middle line:84%
a percentage of what
you've written about.

01:02:51.047 --> 01:02:52.880 align:middle line:84%
But that was the heart
of the story I really

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.540 align:middle line:84%
wanted to get to, is how this
story became perpetuated,

01:02:56.540 --> 01:03:00.290 align:middle line:84%
this notion of this angry
punishing god of humanity,

01:03:00.290 --> 01:03:05.360 align:middle line:84%
that took form as patriarchy
on this planet, which was never

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.160 align:middle line:84%
how it was intended,
nor how it started.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.260 align:middle line:84%
There was always
male-female, there

01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:11.225 align:middle line:84%
was always that freedom,
balance, sexuality.

01:03:11.225 --> 01:03:13.200 align:middle line:10%
>> HARDY: In all
ancient cultures.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:18.600 align:middle line:10%
So with that, thank
you so much for coming.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.170 align:middle line:84%
We could probably talk for
six more hours on this.

01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:22.170 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Chris.

01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:24.302 align:middle line:84%
>> HARDY: Thank you
so much, Regina.

01:03:24.302 --> 01:03:26.030 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Words of
the Anunnaki Gods

01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:27.767 align:middle line:10%
is a wonderful body
of research for those

01:03:27.767 --> 01:03:29.600 align:middle line:10%
who are trying to put
their minds around how

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:33.560 align:middle line:10%
the human species has ended up
in such a compromised position,

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.260 align:middle line:10%
in terms of our ability
to think clearly,

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:39.650 align:middle line:10%
and in terms of honoring the
differences between ourselves

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:40.630 align:middle line:10%
and others.

01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:43.180 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
