>>JEAN SLATTER: What
we're looking for

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and the cure for
impostor syndrome

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.030 align:middle line:90%
is knowing what is mine to do.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.510 align:middle line:84%
The thing of it is about waiting
until you, quote-unquote, "feel

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.260 align:middle line:84%
worthy," honestly,
that might not happen.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's not the point.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.090 align:middle line:84%
I shut the book, and for three
months I went into depression.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it at the time,
but it was a booming voice that

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.130 align:middle line:90%
said, who do you think you are?

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're acting from
your soul, that's

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.690 align:middle line:84%
what you're here to
do, and so do it.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's energy belongs
in your energy field.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Your energy field
needs to be sovereign.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.020 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.020 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In the
world of social media,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.940 align:middle line:10%
it's easy to feel
like a fake because we

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:10%
tend to show our own sizzle
reels, our aspirational

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.040 align:middle line:10%
or ideal versions of ourselves.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.510 align:middle line:90%
But what's underneath this?

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that the
biggest fear of the world's

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.200 align:middle line:84%
most wealthy and
powerful people is

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:84%
that they will be
discovered for the imposter

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.340 align:middle line:90%
or fraud they really are?

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Jean Slatter is here today to
talk about imposter syndrome

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.110 align:middle line:90%
and finding our self-worth.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.485 align:middle line:84%
Jean, it's good
to have you back.

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:19.568 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Thanks, Regina.

00:01:19.568 --> 00:01:20.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to be here.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.607 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Master
Dowser, your course,

00:01:22.607 --> 00:01:23.440 align:middle line:90%
is still going well?

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.830 align:middle line:90%
Everything is going--

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Everything's
going great.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --well with that?

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:25.845 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Thank you.

00:01:25.845 --> 00:01:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well anyway,
I love what you do,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.770 align:middle line:84%
which is why I keep having
you back because this

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.720 align:middle line:90%
applies to so many things.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And we keep talking about
people finding their connection

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.840 align:middle line:84%
with their higher truth,
their higher self,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.990 align:middle line:84%
and that's not so easy
with all the noise.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's what dowsing at
a really high-level offers.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.830 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for your
diligence, your hard work, all

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:48.720 align:middle line:90%
your protocols.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.470 align:middle line:84%
So let's start talking,
before I head off,

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.000 align:middle line:84%
about self-worth
because you deal

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.770 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of different
kinds of clients,

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.480 align:middle line:90%
and self-worth is the big thing.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the things humanity
seems to suffer from most.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: It really does.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot has
to do with the fact

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.140 align:middle line:84%
of social media
and all the places

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.030 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
compare ourselves to.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.990 align:middle line:10%
But ultimately, what
we're looking for

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:10%
and the cure for
imposter syndrome

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:10%
is knowing what is mine to do.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is
it's a spiritual quest.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.500 align:middle line:10%
And when you know that, then
you express that into the world.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So in a nutshell, knowing
what is mine to do

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.420 align:middle line:90%
is all about shining your light.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Sounds trite, but
that is what your job

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:90%
is, to shine your light.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.480 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
has to be something

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.513 align:middle line:84%
that brings fulfillment
and joy or your life

00:02:44.513 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:90%
is not going to shine.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.888 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to
be another duty.

00:02:46.888 --> 00:02:47.971 align:middle line:90%
So let's get back to duty.

00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:48.771 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: OK.

00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in
the Western world,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.330 align:middle line:84%
we're set up,
especially if we were

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.060 align:middle line:84%
raised with any of the
Judeo-Christian religions,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:90%
to be sinners.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.320 align:middle line:84%
We're sinners in
the eyes of God.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Original sin, not
original blessing.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Born in sin.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And the fault of most
religions and New Age thought

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.770 align:middle line:90%
is that, wherever you are--

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.890 align:middle line:84%
if you're here on
Earth, it's because you

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.390 align:middle line:84%
have to work something
out, you have

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.800 align:middle line:84%
to prove yourself to get to
a better place, to Heaven,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.990 align:middle line:90%
nirvana, even enlightenment.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.735 align:middle line:84%
But if you're here, it means
that you've got to work--

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've already
done something wrong

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.720 align:middle line:90%
or you wouldn't have been born.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Exactly.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a
very false premise.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.790 align:middle line:84%
We're here as a divine
expression of God,

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and we're here to be creators,
creators of experience.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And so it's an ongoing discovery
of that and shining that light.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
you and I talked

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.090 align:middle line:84%
about previously or
off-camera is the fact

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.330 align:middle line:84%
that people are honored
in such a very narrow band

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.430 align:middle line:84%
of expression, such
as in academia.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.450 align:middle line:84%
You're only honored for one
style, really, of learning.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And you excel-- you can go up
through the ranks by numbers

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.380 align:middle line:84%
and rankings if you learn
that particular way, which

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.633 align:middle line:90%
is the dominant way.

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a moment

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.470 align:middle line:84%
because that wasn't the
dominant way even 100 years ago.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right, right.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
I'm talking about.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.100 align:middle line:84%
You can develop a
skill or you can

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:84%
develop a certain
level of knowledge,

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.190 align:middle line:90%
but will that fulfill your soul?

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Will that be something that you
know that you are expressing

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:90%
your divine self through?

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And if it isn't, ultimately it's
a sense of "I'm not fulfilled."

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well yeah,
you're not fulfilled.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.110 align:middle line:84%
You're not doing your thing,
what you were born and designed

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.910 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.760 align:middle line:84%
But also the feelings we
talked at the very beginning

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.880 align:middle line:90%
about, our own self-worth.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.630 align:middle line:84%
If you're falling on a scale
that's publicly acknowledged

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.290 align:middle line:84%
as being smart versus
dumb, your self-esteem

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.110 align:middle line:84%
has really taken a hit through
the process of education

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.820 align:middle line:90%
just as one thing.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And so it takes, again, a
focus on your spiritual nature

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.530 align:middle line:84%
to overcome that and
to understand and have

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.720 align:middle line:84%
close conversation
with your guidance

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.800 align:middle line:84%
to know what it is you're here
to do and to bring that forth.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in addition to
bowing to those in our class

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.870 align:middle line:84%
or the A, A-plus
students, have 4.0,

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.530 align:middle line:84%
we also bow to power
and fame, which

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.690 align:middle line:90%
to me is the most false of all.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.140 align:middle line:84%
The way people achieve power
and fame is often quite false.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Talk about imposter syndrome.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that
part of our own character.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.150 align:middle line:84%
What are we looking for in
these people on glossy covers

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.640 align:middle line:90%
and various apps that pop up?

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And
every one of those

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.070 align:middle line:84%
is looking at something
else outside of themselves

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and saying, I want
to aspire to be that,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.770 align:middle line:84%
or they're letting society
tell them what they should be.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.250 align:middle line:90%
And when they achieve it.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.890 align:middle line:84%
There is that lack
of fulfillment.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And how can you be
authentic when you're not

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.280 align:middle line:90%
living from your divine self?

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.760 align:middle line:90%
You can't be authentic.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, you
end up in a place

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.400 align:middle line:84%
where you may have all
these achievements,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.150 align:middle line:90%
but the fulfillment isn't there.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.820 align:middle line:84%
So you as you were saying
earlier in the conversation,

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.910 align:middle line:84%
being a tuning fork
for our soul to be

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.190 align:middle line:84%
able to get that information
through so we can feel it,

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.040 align:middle line:90%
so we can vibe in it.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.820 align:middle line:84%
The mind is an
interesting thing.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.640 align:middle line:90%
So we can feel it emotionally.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.490 align:middle line:10%
So we can feel it where
it lands in our body.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.710 align:middle line:84%
All this is reflecting
truth to us, right?

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right, it is.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.850 align:middle line:10%
And this journey that we're
on, having a close conversation

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.790 align:middle line:10%
with your guidance
about this journey

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.420 align:middle line:10%
will lead to some
unexpected discoveries.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.050 align:middle line:84%
You're always in a place
of evolving and growing.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't like you wake
up one morning and you say,

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.100 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly who I am
and what I'm here to do,

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.190 align:middle line:84%
and there's no more
that I have to discover.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Instead, this discovery takes
a lifetime and some of it

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.148 align:middle line:84%
shows up that is really
surprising to you.

00:07:12.148 --> 00:07:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, it has for you.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: It has.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
talk about it a little bit.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.382 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, you'd
never see it coming.

00:07:17.382 --> 00:07:19.690 align:middle line:84%
But then when-- your job
is to say yes to that.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.870 align:middle line:84%
When your guidance is gently
pushing you in that direction,

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:23.710 align:middle line:90%
say yes.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and we have
to be willing to be a fool.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.270 align:middle line:84%
We have to be willing
to make mistakes.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And the famous saying--
the only mistake

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:84%
is if we don't learn
something from it.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the only time we
really make a mistake.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.910 align:middle line:84%
We have to be willing to
put ourselves on the line.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
are so clamped down

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:84%
into these fear factors of what
they think they can and can't

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:54.170 align:middle line:84%
do, what their parameters are,
what the rules of the game are.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.920 align:middle line:84%
We have to start shifting
the rules of the game.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.670 align:middle line:90%
There are no rules, really.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: No, there
aren't any rules.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you are
in connection with your soul

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.100 align:middle line:84%
and you are having
that conversation,

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:84%
you'll be able to
clearly identify then

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.060 align:middle line:84%
what is yours to
do and what is not.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's so easy then to say
no to what is not yours to do.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And that is a beautiful
thing because society

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:84%
may be pushing you in
a certain direction,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.070 align:middle line:84%
and you can very confidently
say, no, that's not for me.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.327 align:middle line:90%
I might have talent there.

00:08:28.327 --> 00:08:29.660 align:middle line:90%
It might look like it's a match.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.140 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not feeling it.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
not feeling it, no,

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.400 align:middle line:90%
don't place your energy there.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
get into the topic

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.190 align:middle line:84%
of "but I have to survive,"
so we'll get to that later.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.700 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that you
say, and I agree 100%,

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:84%
is that you don't need to
already know how to do it.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to wait until
you've mastered something

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.140 align:middle line:90%
to feel worthy of doing it.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: No, absolutely not.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:00.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a journey and
it's self-discovery.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And so just get out
there and try it.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And the thing of
it is about waiting

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.837 align:middle line:84%
until you, quote-unquote,
"feel worthy,"

00:09:07.837 --> 00:09:09.170 align:middle line:90%
honestly, that might not happen.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.865 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:09:09.865 --> 00:09:11.698 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
might never feel worthy.

00:09:11.698 --> 00:09:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: That day may not
come, and it's not the point.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And I have a great story
that illustrates that.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.130 align:middle line:84%
In Northern
California, there was

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.930 align:middle line:84%
a gentleman that brought
the Bowen technique, which

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:25.730 align:middle line:90%
is a type of--

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of body work.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah,
it's a type of--

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's like a release.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Needle-less acupuncture is
how I've heard it described.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And this gentleman brought
Bown to the entire Northern

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.750 align:middle line:90%
California area.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And he had clients that would
line up outside of his house

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.900 align:middle line:84%
around the block to have a
session with him, literally.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.360 align:middle line:90%
He had such a gift and a talent.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.180 align:middle line:84%
He could look at
and say, OK, I can

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.840 align:middle line:84%
see where you're out
of balance, and we

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.400 align:middle line:90%
can do something about that.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.750 align:middle line:84%
But listen, he was the
most unlikely healer

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:03.755 align:middle line:90%
you would ever imagine.

00:10:03.755 --> 00:10:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What was he like?

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't know his back story.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.945 align:middle line:90%
I've had Bowen sessions.

00:10:06.945 --> 00:10:08.570 align:middle line:84%
They're good, but
what's his backstory?

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Oh, my gosh.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.990 align:middle line:84%
First of all, he would
greet you at the door

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.390 align:middle line:90%
usually in shorts and bare feet.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And his feet were just club
feet with huge calluses.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.540 align:middle line:90%
He had an enormous belly.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And he could never quite get
the shirt to cover the belly,

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.605 align:middle line:84%
so you'd have a herniated
belly button looking at you.

00:10:27.605 --> 00:10:28.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And he drank coffee from the
time he got up in the morning

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.540 align:middle line:84%
till the time he went
to bed, and smoked,

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.480 align:middle line:90%
and he swore like a mechanic.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.800 align:middle line:90%
A total unlikely healer.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.320 align:middle line:84%
So if he had said
to himself, I have

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.960 align:middle line:84%
to wait until I'm
the epitome of health

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle line:84%
before I can help others, the
world would have missed out.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And not only did
he help all of his clients,

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.250 align:middle line:84%
but he went on to
create a school

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and taught hundreds
of other practitioners

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.410 align:middle line:84%
who went on to help
thousands of patients.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.720 align:middle line:84%
The world would have
missed out if he

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.610 align:middle line:90%
was waiting to feel worthy.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To
epitomize good health.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:10.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:90%
I love that story.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about yourself when

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.550 align:middle line:84%
you were getting ready to
do what you're doing now.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And there's something about
an octopus story in this?

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:20.516 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:11:20.516 --> 00:11:21.350 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love octopi.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So what happened for
me when I was writing "Hiring

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.170 align:middle line:84%
the Heavens"-- we're going back
quite a number of years here--

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.380 align:middle line:84%
first of all, I was
given the message

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.450 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to write
"Hiring the Heavens."

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:37.075 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What year
did you write that?

00:11:37.075 --> 00:11:38.738 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: And that was in 2003.

00:11:38.738 --> 00:11:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I must
have met you not too

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.420 align:middle line:90%
long-- a few years after that.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.780 align:middle line:10%
And when you're given a
message by your guidance,

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.790 align:middle line:10%
you know it's yours to do.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So I was very
comfortable with that,

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.390 align:middle line:90%
and I began writing the book.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And there was a point in the
development where I thought,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to print this
out now and read it

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.470 align:middle line:84%
as if I'm a first-time reader
and see what my thoughts are.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And as I did that, turning page
after page, I got so excited.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:84%
I thought, this is so good,
I love this, oh my gosh,

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and getting more and more
inspired with my own writing.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I got about 3/4 of
the way through,

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.640 align:middle line:90%
and something came over me.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:24.950 align:middle line:84%
It was an enormous black
cloud that descended.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:30.770 align:middle line:84%
I shut the book, put it down
in the lower file cabinet,

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and for three months I
went into depression.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.170 align:middle line:90%
I never looked at it.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know,
I didn't even have

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.990 align:middle line:84%
words to express what
I was going through

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.540 align:middle line:90%
or why I had done such a thing.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.320 align:middle line:10%
What was wrong with me?

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.590 align:middle line:90%
Why did I put that book away?

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Why am I not working on it?

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:90%
And I kept asking my guidance.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.720 align:middle line:10%
I said, you wanted
me to write this.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.470 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with me?

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.650 align:middle line:84%
How come I just
want to stay in bed

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:00.530 align:middle line:90%
with the covers over my head?

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:06.950 align:middle line:84%
So three months later, my
guidance gave me a dream.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:84%
It was so profound,
Regina, and I

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.380 align:middle line:84%
knew it was the answer to why
I wasn't writing the book.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.330 align:middle line:90%
And here's what it was.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.550 align:middle line:84%
In my dream, I was
standing in front

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.410 align:middle line:84%
of a mirror without
any clothes on,

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.270 align:middle line:90%
and I was checking myself out.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was saying to myself,
well, I see some flaws,

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.160 align:middle line:90%
but overall pretty good.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I looked down and there
was this fold around my torso.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream, it was
as if everyone has a fold,

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.160 align:middle line:90%
so that wasn't unusual.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But I pulled the fold
down, and underneath

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.650 align:middle line:84%
it looked like the
suckers on an octopus leg.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Whoa.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: And I went, oh!

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh!

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, how did that get there!

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.140 align:middle line:90%
I was beside myself.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:57.680 align:middle line:84%
I was so horrified
because it looked hideous.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.860 align:middle line:84%
I woke myself up
in a cold sweat,

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:84%
just mortified that
that existed on my body.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I also knew that was
the answer to why

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.370 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't finishing my book.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.320 align:middle line:84%
So day after day, I asked my
guidance, explain it to me.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.960 align:middle line:84%
I know this is why I'm
not writing my book,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:90%
but I don't get it.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.370 align:middle line:90%
What's the meaning?

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:23.660 align:middle line:90%
Days went by.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.740 align:middle line:84%
On the seventh day,
I have another dream.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And in this dream, I'm
sitting across from myself,

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.570 align:middle line:90%
pretty much like we are now.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And I had my arms crossed,
and I'm looking at myself

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:90%
rather impatiently.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And I say, in a sneer, so
you still haven't gotten it?

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.940 align:middle line:90%
All right, I'll tell you.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And I proceeded to tell myself
what the meaning of the dream

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:49.880 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And what it was is that
I was checking myself out

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.440 align:middle line:84%
in front of a mirror without
any clothes on because when

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.270 align:middle line:84%
you put a book out there,
you make yourself vulnerable.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: You tell the world--

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kind of naked.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, who you
are, what your thoughts are.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.250 align:middle line:90%
You expose yourself.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:11.540 align:middle line:10%
But then the fear
was that if I did

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:18.830 align:middle line:10%
that, they might see something
so horrible, so disgusting,

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:23.240 align:middle line:10%
it would turn their stomach and
they'd walk away in disgust.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:84%
That fear is something
that we all have.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.485 align:middle line:84%
It goes like, if
you really knew me--

00:15:30.485 --> 00:15:33.537 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] if you really knew me--

00:15:33.537 --> 00:15:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you term
it almost like, well,

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.563 align:middle line:90%
who do you think you are?

00:15:37.563 --> 00:15:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: That was the dark
cloud that descended upon me.

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:47.540 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it at the time,
but it was a booming voice that

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:90%
said, who do you think you are?

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.390 align:middle line:84%
What makes you think
you have anything to say

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:55.130 align:middle line:90%
that anybody wants to hear?

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:84%
What makes you
think you're going

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:84%
to write a book that
anyone wants to read?

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.740 align:middle line:90%
Who do you think you are?

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:84%
You just need to go to bed,
pull the covers over your head,

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:05.340 align:middle line:90%
and don't come up.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Forget about it.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.400 align:middle line:90%
That was the voice.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:09.935 align:middle line:90%
That's intense.

00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:10.735 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: It was.

00:16:10.735 --> 00:16:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you for
sharing that because--

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.532 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get to
this in a little bit,

00:16:14.532 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:84%
but I alluded to it in
the open of the show

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.890 align:middle line:90%
when I was introducing you.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.730 align:middle line:84%
In that Fortune 500 study
that was done many years ago--

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and a friend told me
about it because I

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:29.510 align:middle line:84%
was getting ready to launch
a new kind of product

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:90%
on TV at the time.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And I really wanted to go
for it and do this project,

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.850 align:middle line:84%
but I had my
doubts, like, who do

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I think I am to do this
project, just like you said.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was speaking to a wiser
older male friend of mind.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And he said, do you
know about this study?

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he told me that
the greatest fear of these CEOs

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and presidents of
Fortune 500 companies

00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.140 align:middle line:84%
was that they were going to
be detected for being frauds.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:00.980 align:middle line:90%
The biggest fear.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.060 align:middle line:90%
Number one fear.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.130 align:middle line:84%
So this runs really,
really deep in us.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And so having this
conversation, you

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:10.190 align:middle line:84%
sharing such a vulnerable
story, is so important

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.190 align:middle line:84%
because we all have
something beautiful to offer.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
We all have some kind of
delight that nobody else

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.720 align:middle line:84%
knows like we do to offer the
world, whatever that may be.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to tap
into that is the key,

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and then have the courage
to offer it, no matter

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.819 align:middle line:90%
how crazy it is.

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:29.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to the
next part of it, which

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.180 align:middle line:84%
is the feelings of
unworthiness that most

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.530 align:middle line:90%
everybody experiences.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:84%
How do we then turn those around
into feelings of empowerment?

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:39.650 align:middle line:90%
Like what happened?

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:43.100 align:middle line:84%
After you realized the message,
what happened with you?

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Then I
realized that, OK,

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:84%
if I have this octopus leg, if
that exists, I need to find it.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.540 align:middle line:90%
I need to be aware of it.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And so you actually
go looking for it.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
you start exploring

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:03.030 align:middle line:84%
your feelings of unworthiness
and seeing if they really

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:03.830 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's the funny
thing about all this.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, where we want to get
to is the idea that worthiness,

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.460 align:middle line:84%
unworthiness, it's
irrelevant, it means nothing,

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:21.260 align:middle line:84%
and that they're just tools
through which the soul uses

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.720 align:middle line:90%
to grow and evolve.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.080 align:middle line:84%
When I was working with
some of my students,

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:32.180 align:middle line:84%
we had weekly sessions,
and for weeks we

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.400 align:middle line:84%
were dealing with the
subject of unworthiness.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.900 align:middle line:10%
And we thought we had exhausted
it, knew everything about it.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Yet the following
week, guidance wants

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.030 align:middle line:84%
to talk about
unworthiness again.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And we're thinking,
OK, what now?

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.000 align:middle line:90%
What more do we need to know?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.780 align:middle line:10%
And this time, guidance
said, don't underestimate

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:56.260 align:middle line:10%
the gift of feeling unworthy.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.210 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, really?

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.740 align:middle line:90%
Well, how could that be?

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.970 align:middle line:10%
And what they explained
is that, again, it

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:07.990 align:middle line:10%
is a tool through which the
soul uses to grow and evolve.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, I thought
about my first two children.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.150 align:middle line:84%
With my first child,
I had health issues

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.460 align:middle line:90%
and he had health issues.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I certainly felt
unworthy as a mom.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, I
went on to study nutrition,

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:28.872 align:middle line:90%
get my degree in naturopathy.

00:19:28.872 --> 00:19:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I became a naturopath
because of the struggles

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.010 align:middle line:84%
that I went through
with my first child.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:41.290 align:middle line:10%
My second child, I had
definitely some karmic issues

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:44.020 align:middle line:10%
there, and that
brought me to explore

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:49.120 align:middle line:10%
all sorts of spiritual
studies and to understand

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.250 align:middle line:10%
the nature of our past lives
and what we're doing here.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I became, in
large part due to that,

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.100 align:middle line:84%
I became a spiritual
teacher because of it.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:05.170 align:middle line:84%
So I grew and evolved
through tremendous feelings

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:10.570 align:middle line:84%
of unworthiness, tremendous
days and days of tears.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:14.650 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, you also had
a pretty rigid and not very

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:18.160 align:middle line:10%
productive religious
background, which held you back

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:18.960 align:middle line:10%
on a lot of levels.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.293 align:middle line:90%
You had to overcome all of that.

00:20:20.293 --> 00:20:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I had to
overcome all of that.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.230 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I grew.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And so then I realized
that, yeah, I'm

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.440 align:middle line:84%
the person I am today
because of those struggles.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, my next two children,
wonderful children, they

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:37.390 align:middle line:84%
were gifts, but I didn't
have struggles with them.

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:39.815 align:middle line:90%
My first two made me who I am.

00:20:39.815 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's
interesting, though.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.290 align:middle line:10%
You have a personality unlike--

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:47.560 align:middle line:10%
I only one other person
like you that has

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:53.980 align:middle line:10%
such an incredible
diligence to exploring

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.280 align:middle line:10%
and digging and learning from
everything that comes up.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.220 align:middle line:84%
You don't waste an
opportunity for learning ever.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Where the rest of us might
say, oh yeah, and, oh yeah,

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.920 align:middle line:84%
I get that, but they're not
going to take as deep a dive

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.720 align:middle line:90%
as you do.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:84%
But the proof is in
the pudding for you.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.350 align:middle line:84%
You have expanded
yourself in so many ways

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.700 align:middle line:84%
because you take the time and
care enough to dive deeply

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.370 align:middle line:90%
into whatever these wounds are.

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:20.690 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say
I so respect that.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little bit
more about imposter syndrome

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:26.300 align:middle line:84%
because this really, we
talked about a moment ago,

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.320 align:middle line:84%
particularly affects people that
appear to be high achievers.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's this idea
that, somehow, we're

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:40.240 align:middle line:84%
fake inside, which is very
similar to that octopus leg.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.780 align:middle line:84%
But the more that you are
connected with your spiritual

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.570 align:middle line:84%
journey and understand what
your soul is here to do--

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:47.680 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not--

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.410 align:middle line:84%
the types of things
that we're describing

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.860 align:middle line:84%
when we say our gifts
of spirit are things

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:57.580 align:middle line:90%
like, who am I as a person?

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.530 align:middle line:90%
Who am I as a soul?

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:00.730 align:middle line:90%
What are my gifts?

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.560 align:middle line:90%
Am I here as a teacher?

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Am I here as a minister?

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:06.760 align:middle line:90%
Am I here as a rebel?

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.200 align:middle line:90%
What is it about me?

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.030 align:middle line:90%
Am I here as a researcher?

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:84%
What are those gifts that I
have that I'm here to express?

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.660 align:middle line:90%
And how do I express that light?

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:20.620 align:middle line:84%
So the more we're in
touch with and expressing

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:25.520 align:middle line:84%
that light, the less we will
feel that imposter syndrome.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: In fact,
I would venture

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.420 align:middle line:84%
to say that it's impossible
to feel it if you

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.628 align:middle line:90%
are coming from your soul.

00:22:33.628 --> 00:22:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would
say that's accurate

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.185 align:middle line:84%
because there's such a deep
sense of knowing at that point.

00:22:38.185 --> 00:22:41.020 align:middle line:84%
One of the misperceptions
people have about others

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.810 align:middle line:84%
who appear to be
successful-- because success

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:44.783 align:middle line:90%
is a broad word.

00:22:44.783 --> 00:22:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Just because you make the cover
of a magazine doesn't mean

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.210 align:middle line:90%
you're a success in life.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:53.560 align:middle line:84%
But that being said, one of the
things that people often say

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.430 align:middle line:84%
is, well, you can do that
because you don't have fear.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.710 align:middle line:90%
That is not true.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:03.370 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that, how people really--

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.600 align:middle line:90%
you do it in spite of the fear.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.708 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] And you push yourself.

00:23:08.708 --> 00:23:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You push yourself
in spite of the fear.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:15.340 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: And step up to
the plate because that is--

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.740 align:middle line:10%
if you're acting from your soul,
that's what you're here to do.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.580 align:middle line:10%
And so do it.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Be about that.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.680 align:middle line:84%
It's being able to say
to that voice that says,

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.780 align:middle line:90%
who do you think you are--

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:30.250 align:middle line:84%
it's that awareness of,
yes, I do know who I am,

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:35.560 align:middle line:84%
so now I can tell that voice,
you go lay back in bed [LAUGHS]

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.080 align:middle line:84%
because I have a job to do and
I need to be about my work here.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.270 align:middle line:90%
And people tend to become--

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.240 align:middle line:84%
I talked-- I said this
earlier in the program,

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.520 align:middle line:84%
that we tend to
become paralyzed.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:52.200 align:middle line:84%
We'll be confronted with a
new possibility or a new idea,

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.020 align:middle line:84%
but this whole notion
of "is that for me?"--

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:59.520 align:middle line:84%
at first blush, we're going to
go into automatic programming

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.620 align:middle line:90%
reaction rather than response.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:10%
And having to strip away
those filters of what

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.700 align:middle line:10%
our family, our culture, and
society has said we're allowed

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.790 align:middle line:10%
to do, that's a big process.

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.270 align:middle line:90%
How do you guide your clients?

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:16.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's stripping away
these old beliefs,

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.560 align:middle line:84%
these old programs that
stop them from joyously

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:90%
jumping into the new.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm working
with my clients,

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:28.470 align:middle line:84%
it's always with
their higher guidance

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:31.470 align:middle line:84%
because no one knows them like
their own higher guidance.

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it would
just be a guess.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.760 align:middle line:84%
So you need to
have a way to have

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.720 align:middle line:84%
that conversation with
your higher guidance,

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.780 align:middle line:84%
however you've developed
that, whether it's

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.440 align:middle line:84%
through meditation, through
dowsing, through oracles,

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.570 align:middle line:84%
through some intuitive
means where you're

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:47.970 align:middle line:84%
having that conversation
with your higher guidance

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and getting to your true
authentic self and discovering.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.620 align:middle line:90%
It is a journey of discovery.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that is a process.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that
you have done is

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:03.390 align:middle line:84%
you've developed really very
thorough protocols in terms

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:84%
of dowsing because so
many-- everyone I know

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.450 align:middle line:84%
has a little pendulum
or dowsing rods.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:10.990 align:middle line:90%
He loves me, he loves me not.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, see?

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.280 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So you're just feeding
yourself what you want to hear.

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So what does it take to go into
that more mature, relaxed state

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:25.110 align:middle line:84%
where, when a person
is dowsing, they're

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.530 align:middle line:84%
not trying to program
it and they accept

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:32.280 align:middle line:84%
what comes their way, regardless
if it's what they want to hear?

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.770 align:middle line:84%
That takes some
maturity and relaxation.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And
it's a discipline.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Some people are just
born with that gift where

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:45.430 align:middle line:84%
they can immediately sense
what their higher guidance is

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:46.230 align:middle line:90%
saying.

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.370 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not
one of those people,

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't, it is a
discipline and it's a practice.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And it happens and
evolves over time.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What, you
lied to yourself

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:90%
quite a bit in the beginning?

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: I didn't-- yeah.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.600 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm quite certain
that I had no clue

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.180 align:middle line:84%
on even how to ask good
questions in the beginning.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but
you developed it

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.480 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of us.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.680 align:middle line:90%
You did a good job.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: But it's sticking
with it and continuing to ask

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.475 align:middle line:84%
a question and have the door
open to whatever is coming

00:26:21.475 --> 00:26:22.275 align:middle line:90%
through--

00:26:22.275 --> 00:26:23.115 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And don't be
afraid of the answer.

00:26:23.115 --> 00:26:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: --without
censoring it.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And trying to
manipulate the answer.

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And so just being open
to what comes through.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not wise
to hide from truth.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And if the truth
is coming through

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and you don't like what
you're hearing, just relax.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything-- the entirety of
our lives begin to take a right

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.790 align:middle line:84%
turn when we can accept
and look at the deeper

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.080 align:middle line:90%
truths of ourselves.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Because none of us want to
see ourselves as flawed.

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.940 align:middle line:84%
We're all-- we are
looking oftentimes

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.550 align:middle line:84%
through our own sizzle
reel lens at our lives,

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:58.710 align:middle line:90%
the aspirational part of it.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And we need to let go and say,
it's OK, we're all flawed.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:05.190 align:middle line:84%
We can listen to this, and
if we get a no when we wanted

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.780 align:middle line:90%
to hear a yes, that's OK.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.303 align:middle line:84%
Just keep asking more
refined questions

00:27:10.303 --> 00:27:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and you'll know where
you start working.

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you end up
finding an octopus leg--

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's OK too.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Go ahead
and explore that

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and consider that that's
actually a gift to you

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.630 align:middle line:90%
to now grow and evolve.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.410 align:middle line:84%
So you say there's
a process of it too,

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.020 align:middle line:84%
and that has to do with
accepting, claiming,

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.250 align:middle line:90%
and proclaiming.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Ah.

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:34.950 align:middle line:90%
This is the secret formula.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You and I had a
little private talk about that.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, we did.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.500 align:middle line:84%
This is the secret formula
to overcoming the imposter

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:41.410 align:middle line:90%
syndrome.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:43.470 align:middle line:90%
So the first part is accept.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:45.810 align:middle line:84%
What that means-- accept
the gifts that you've

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.160 align:middle line:90%
been given by spirit.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, these gifts are not
things that you earned.

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.670 align:middle line:90%
They're not skills you develop.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.130 align:middle line:84%
They were given to you
because you're a god self.

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to accept that,
yes, I do have that ability.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:04.950 align:middle line:90%
It was given to me.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.920 align:middle line:90%
And now claim it as yours to do.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.720 align:middle line:84%
This is now something that you
are to express into the world.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And the third part
is the magic part,

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and that's when you
proclaim it to the world.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:23.910 align:middle line:84%
So an example would be
when I was beginning

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:27.960 align:middle line:84%
to understand and explore
the nature of spirituality

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and did all of my research
and conversations,

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:35.970 align:middle line:84%
countless conversations
with my higher guidance,

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:37.110 align:middle line:90%
I got a message--

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.750 align:middle line:84%
when I threw the
I Ching [LAUGHS]

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.670 align:middle line:84%
I got a message that
literally changed my life.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:45.930 align:middle line:84%
It was a simple
statement that said,

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:49.470 align:middle line:84%
it is time now for you
to share with the world

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.350 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual insights
you have received.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And I knew then that
I had to proclaim

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.390 align:middle line:90%
that I was a spiritual teacher.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's the interesting
thing and the magic about

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:02.820 align:middle line:90%
proclaiming.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Until that moment, until
I had proclaimed it,

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:10.140 align:middle line:84%
there wouldn't be an authority
on the planet that could tell

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.030 align:middle line:90%
me I was a spiritual teacher.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:13.620 align:middle line:90%
I would have said no.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:18.240 align:middle line:84%
I just find this fascinating
and interesting, but no.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.760 align:middle line:84%
But then the minute
that I proclaimed

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.060 align:middle line:84%
that there isn't an
authority on the planet that

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:28.200 align:middle line:84%
can tell me otherwise, I
am a spiritual teacher.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And so that art of proclaiming
changes everything.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:37.480 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the world now will
respond to you differently

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.450 align:middle line:90%
the minute you proclaim.

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And so for myself,
I am not a writer.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to proclaim that.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.970 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I write in order to
express my spiritual teachings,

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:49.380 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not a writer.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.240 align:middle line:90%
I know that's not mine to do.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm clear about that and
I'm comfortable about that.

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:58.770 align:middle line:84%
But I can say I am
a spiritual teacher,

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:00.600 align:middle line:90%
and that's the magic of it.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
right, and you are.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is something I have
struggled with my entire life.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's not-- I wouldn't
even say struggled.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:13.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just that I haven't
proclaimed anything.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.790 align:middle line:84%
So I meet people,
I meet strangers.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And oh, what do you
do for a living?

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:17.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm a journalist.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's all I'll ever say.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Not the rest of it,
just "I'm a journalist."

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:25.900 align:middle line:90%
And I think, gosh, is that true?

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Is that what I actually am?

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I've just been saying it
for so many years, that's

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:33.600 align:middle line:84%
just what by default
comes out of my mouth.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And also, I don't want to
go into a long explanation

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:36.750 align:middle line:90%
about anything.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:40.020 align:middle line:84%
But the whole notion about
having inner authority

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:43.530 align:middle line:84%
in the spiritual
realms, and other people

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:46.080 align:middle line:84%
will say, you're a spiritual
teacher, you need to claim it.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.065 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I have a
problem with word "teacher."

00:30:49.065 --> 00:30:50.190 align:middle line:90%
I had a problem in school--

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Interesting.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --with
the word "teacher,"

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't like the word "teacher."

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's not something I
could proclaim for myself.

00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:01.200 align:middle line:84%
But I realized
"guide," to help guide,

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.617 align:middle line:90%
I feel comfortable with that.

00:31:02.617 --> 00:31:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was because
of our conversation

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:09.900 align:middle line:84%
that I realized I could proclaim
that I can help guide people.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.412 align:middle line:84%
I'm a guide of sorts, even
in these conversations.

00:31:12.412 --> 00:31:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
felt better for me

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.250 align:middle line:84%
because I have so
much programming

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:20.100 align:middle line:84%
loaded around the word "teacher"
and authority of any kind.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.120 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I was anti-authority
as a child, very much so.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, whereas "teacher" is
perfectly acceptable to you

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:29.610 align:middle line:84%
because you don't have that
relationship to that word.

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, and when you
can find that word that you're

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:37.650 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with and you
proclaim and you say "I am,"

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:40.350 align:middle line:90%
it's never about bragging.

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:46.200 align:middle line:84%
It's never about boasting
and saying, boy, look at me.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.455 align:middle line:90%
It isn't about that.

00:31:47.455 --> 00:31:49.830 align:middle line:84%
It's about honoring the gift
of spirit you've been given.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: If you have that
gift and it was given to you,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.300 align:middle line:84%
the way that you honor
it is to proclaim it.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:01.620 align:middle line:84%
The way you dishonor it
is to say no and hide it.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.000 align:middle line:84%
You know the saying
in the Bible,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:03.960 align:middle line:90%
hide your light under a bushel.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:04.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Light under a bushel.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.565 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:05.565 --> 00:32:06.640 align:middle line:90%
That is Sunday school.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.148 align:middle line:84%
That is dishonoring the
gift that you've been given.

00:32:10.148 --> 00:32:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That really is.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And if I may add, just
from my perspective,

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.690 align:middle line:90%
the notion of the gift--

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:18.060 align:middle line:84%
I see the gift as
something-- because I

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.670 align:middle line:84%
believe in reincarnation--
as something

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:24.960 align:middle line:84%
that has been developed within
the soul over a period of time

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and maybe set aside
for a lifetime

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and then re-emerges
in another lifetime.

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:31.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's something
that you have honed

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and that you have
earned over lifetimes.

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Your soul.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your soul.

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The soul
has experienced this

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and it's bringing it
forward to be utilized.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it was
just dropped on you.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.045 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: No, no.

00:32:45.045 --> 00:32:45.845 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:45.845 --> 00:32:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just making a
clarification of the gift

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.647 align:middle line:84%
you bring forward
from within yourself.

00:32:49.647 --> 00:32:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yes, and
that's your divine self.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's your
divine self, absolutely.

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:56.610 align:middle line:84%
There's one thing--
the fear of rejection.

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And you and I had a
private conversation.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.200 align:middle line:84%
I thought, we've got
to talk about this.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:05.050 align:middle line:84%
The fear of rejection in
society, which of course,

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:08.580 align:middle line:84%
all of these things have to do
with self-worth, uneasiness,

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:09.810 align:middle line:90%
imposter syndrome.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:11.190 align:middle line:90%
All of us experience this.

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:14.640 align:middle line:10%
No one wants to be rejected from
their tribe or their family.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.590 align:middle line:10%
And you were talking about
the world stood still

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:18.390 align:middle line:10%
in the moment.

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:21.060 align:middle line:84%
You saw this scene
in a movie, and it

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:24.480 align:middle line:84%
was from the movie "The Girl
with the Dragon Tattoo."

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.728 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:33:25.728 --> 00:33:27.020 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Oh, a chilling line.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's so--
it's chilling and it's so true.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So set us
all up in the movie.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
have seen it,

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.340 align:middle line:84%
but go ahead for
those who haven't.

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So Daniel
Craig, the main actor,

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:45.750 align:middle line:84%
is searching the house of a guy
who he thinks is a murderer.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:48.810 align:middle line:84%
But he hears the car
come into the driveway,

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:51.480 align:middle line:90%
so he escapes out the back deck.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And he's headed down the hill
when the owner from the deck

00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:00.300 align:middle line:84%
calls down to him and said,
hey, what are you doing?

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.870 align:middle line:84%
He says, oh, acting
all innocent,

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:06.180 align:middle line:84%
I was just coming by to
see if you were there,

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.139 align:middle line:84%
and when you weren't
I thought I'd leave.

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:11.889 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, why
don't you come on back?

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:12.929 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a drink.

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:14.250 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk.

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And so Daniel Craig does,
has the drink, gets poisoned.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:21.750 align:middle line:10%
The next moment,
he wakes up, he's

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:24.179 align:middle line:10%
in the basement,
which appears to be--

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:24.989 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Tied up.

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Tied
up, chained, bound.

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:29.370 align:middle line:84%
He's in-- it's a
torture chamber,

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:31.469 align:middle line:84%
and he knows he's
going to be killed.

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And the murderer
says to him, tell me,

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.760 align:middle line:84%
why didn't you listen
to your instincts?

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.929 align:middle line:84%
You knew I was the murderer,
yet all I had to do

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:45.230 align:middle line:90%
was invite you up for a drink.

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:50.239 align:middle line:84%
Why is the fear of offending
greater than the fear of harm?

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It just almost makes
me cry because, in a small way,

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:58.850 align:middle line:90%
I think each of us does this.

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:02.480 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
offend others, so we'll

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:07.370 align:middle line:84%
put the fear of rejection
ahead of what we instinctively

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:09.560 align:middle line:90%
know is for our best.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, talk about
that a little bit,

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.330 align:middle line:84%
breaking that
syndrome a little bit.

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:19.850 align:middle line:10%
And that comes down
to really being

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:23.550 align:middle line:10%
able to listen to
your gut instincts.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:28.400 align:middle line:84%
If you come across
someone or some situation

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.520 align:middle line:84%
where you get a bad
feeling, listen to that.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And be OK with what would
appear to be rude behavior

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.960 align:middle line:90%
or offensive behavior.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.410 align:middle line:84%
You can be OK with
that if you feel

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:44.690 align:middle line:84%
that this other
person may actually

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:46.640 align:middle line:90%
be there to do you harm.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:53.420 align:middle line:10%
And the thing about others that
are doing harm, it's a rather--

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.070 align:middle line:10%
they do it in disguise.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:57.440 align:middle line:84%
They do it in such a
way that's friendly.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.880 align:middle line:90%
"Come on in for a drink."

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.170 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And so it would
appear to be all innocent.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To disarm you.

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, to disarm you.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:06.800 align:middle line:90%
You have to listen to that.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A chilling
example of, again, something

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:11.880 align:middle line:90%
that we do in subtle ways.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.120 align:middle line:84%
So that gets us into
personality disorders.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.700 align:middle line:84%
One that's really
skyrocketing right now

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.310 align:middle line:84%
seems to be
diagnosable narcissism,

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:21.170 align:middle line:90%
for a variety of reasons.

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And narcissists often
pair with empaths.

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: They do.

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you deal with
this among your clientele.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:30.798 align:middle line:84%
If you're a
narcissist, you won't

00:36:30.798 --> 00:36:32.840 align:middle line:84%
recognize that we're
talking about it because you

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.460 align:middle line:90%
won't see yourself as one.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.830 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about some
of those personality traits.

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And the people watching this
are generally more the empaths

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.680 align:middle line:84%
that end up hooking
up with narcissists,

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.180 align:middle line:84%
so let's talk about
it for a moment.

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So yes, there
seems to be an epidemic

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.300 align:middle line:90%
of narcissists--

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of narcissism.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.030 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: --but there
is also a balance

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:58.190 align:middle line:10%
because there's an epidemic
of empaths to balance it out.

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:00.380 align:middle line:10%
You need to be aware,
you're a prime target.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.000 align:middle line:90%
You're a prime target--

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you're an
empath, you're a target.

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:04.393 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: If you're
an empath, you're

00:37:04.393 --> 00:37:05.810 align:middle line:90%
a prime target for a narcissist.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:06.620 align:middle line:90%
They need you.

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.990 align:middle line:90%
They feed off of you.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:11.250 align:middle line:90%
That's who they're looking for.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So more than ever, an
empath has to be connected

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:20.660 align:middle line:84%
to their spiritual self,
to their gut instincts,

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:24.170 align:middle line:84%
and be able to draw
those boundaries.

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:27.020 align:middle line:84%
The problem with
a lot of empaths

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.840 align:middle line:84%
is that, because they
have such compassion,

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:33.260 align:middle line:84%
they will often draw in
other people's energies

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.790 align:middle line:90%
in order to heal them.

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: But the thing of
it is, is nobody's energy

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:42.140 align:middle line:90%
belongs in your energy field.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Your energy field
needs to be sovereign.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:53.150 align:middle line:10%
Not even your parents,
not your kids,

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:55.980 align:middle line:10%
nobody else needs to be
in your energy field.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:59.180 align:middle line:84%
You need to be the
sole protector of it.

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:01.010 align:middle line:10%
You can work with some--

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:02.910 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't mean that
you can't be empathic.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.910 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that you
can't be compassionate.

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:12.230 align:middle line:84%
It just means you need to do it
from the boundary of your own--

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:14.450 align:middle line:90%
holding onto your own space.

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:18.410 align:middle line:84%
What happens is that,
oftentimes, empaths will not

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:21.230 align:middle line:84%
only draw in people
and attract people

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:26.060 align:middle line:84%
who will be energy vampires
and feed off of them, but also

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:29.030 align:middle line:90%
even in the entity world--

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.312 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:30.312 --> 00:38:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: They'll bring in--

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.723 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Other dimensions.

00:38:32.723 --> 00:38:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Other dimensions.

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:38.570 align:middle line:84%
There is a technique
[LAUGHS] for empaths that

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:40.790 align:middle line:90%
is really quite fascinating.

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:44.120 align:middle line:84%
I got this out of a book called
"Awaken to the Healer Within."

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell
it from your hands.

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.747 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that your
little finger was broken,

00:38:50.747 --> 00:38:52.580 align:middle line:84%
so you probably aren't
going to be able to--

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I've had
three of them-- two cut off

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and the pad cut off of the
other one on the same hand.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:59.318 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So you're not
going to be able to do this.

00:38:59.318 --> 00:39:02.090 align:middle line:84%
But what you do is
you line up the heart

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:06.290 align:middle line:84%
line, which is this line
underneath the little finger.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:10.940 align:middle line:84%
You line that up, and then
you put your little fingers

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.880 align:middle line:84%
together and you
see if they're even.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Now again, yours
aren't going to be.

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.040 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mine's way shorter.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: I know.

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But yours-- normally,
they should be somewhat even.

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: They should
be straight across.

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And if they aren't,
it's an indication

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:27.290 align:middle line:84%
that you've got
energies in your field

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:29.930 align:middle line:84%
that, whether you've
invited them or not,

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:31.190 align:middle line:90%
they just don't belong there.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does it
matter which hand?

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: No.

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So that means you--

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:41.120 align:middle line:84%
so is this a discovery someone
made, or what's the deal?

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Again, I
got it from this book.

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:44.222 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who the author is.

00:39:44.222 --> 00:39:46.910 align:middle line:84%
The name of the book is
"Awaken to the Healer Within."

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:49.352 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating,
Regina, because--

00:39:49.352 --> 00:39:51.935 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wow, everybody right
now is going like this at home.

00:39:51.935 --> 00:39:52.735 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:39:52.735 --> 00:39:55.875 align:middle line:84%
I've been using it for
years with clients.

00:39:55.875 --> 00:39:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is it true?

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Oh.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.460 align:middle line:90%
There's a prayer to say.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the
prayer is saying

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.230 align:middle line:84%
that whatever is
in my auric field

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:07.380 align:middle line:84%
with or without my
permission, I ask you now

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:11.820 align:middle line:84%
to go to the core of
your being, so be it,

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and with love and just lovingly
saying, you don't belong here.

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:20.515 align:middle line:84%
Then they recheck their
fingers and they're even.

00:40:20.515 --> 00:40:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my gosh.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I had one client
fall out of her chair

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.613 align:middle line:90%
because she couldn't believe it.

00:40:24.613 --> 00:40:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Her fingers were so off,
and then said a prayer,

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.150 align:middle line:90%
and then they were even.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And it makes
a huge difference.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And I will tell
you also that this

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.400 align:middle line:90%
happened for my second son.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And when I read this
and-- because it

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:43.680 align:middle line:84%
can influence your
personality, you can imagine.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.110 align:middle line:84%
To the extreme, if
someone's possessed,

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.990 align:middle line:84%
they're not even going
to be themselves.

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And so my son, I had him
check his little fingers,

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.440 align:middle line:90%
and they were off.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.900 align:middle line:90%
And he said the prayer.

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.850 align:middle line:84%
His personality
changed after that.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:02.745 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Say the prayer
again that people can say.

00:41:02.745 --> 00:41:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: It is whatever
is in my auric field

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:07.800 align:middle line:84%
with or without my
permission, I ask you now

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.890 align:middle line:90%
to go to the core of your being.

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:11.850 align:middle line:90%
Go with light.

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:12.690 align:middle line:90%
Go with love.

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:13.695 align:middle line:90%
So be it.

00:41:13.695 --> 00:41:14.528 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:41:14.528 --> 00:41:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And it's
just basically saying,

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.477 align:middle line:90%
you don't belong here.

00:41:17.477 --> 00:41:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so many
people watching this right

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.300 align:middle line:90%
now are empaths.

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And so you just gave a wonderful
gift to a lot of people.

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:30.368 align:middle line:84%
So on that note, we need to take
a quick look because we didn't

00:41:30.368 --> 00:41:31.410 align:middle line:90%
even get to your artwork.

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:33.077 align:middle line:84%
I just want to do
this to finish it off.

00:41:33.077 --> 00:41:35.220 align:middle line:84%
You took a big leap
of faith recently

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and because your guidance told
you-- diversify, diversify.

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Because you were finding
yourself under your covers

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and your life had collapsed
in on itself, and they said,

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.750 align:middle line:90%
diversify, do what you love.

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And you exploded
into a creative mode.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I'll
tell you, Regina,

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.520 align:middle line:84%
when the angels tell you to do
something, you have to do it.

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:53.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You do.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:55.050 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: You do.

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you did it.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:57.660 align:middle line:90%
You have done it.

00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: What
my angels told me

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:05.160 align:middle line:84%
was that I had devoted so many
years to my spiritual studies

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:09.643 align:middle line:84%
and my programs, and they
said, now you're done.

00:42:09.643 --> 00:42:11.310 align:middle line:10%
And not that you're
not going to still--

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:12.390 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Your course
is always available

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:13.432 align:middle line:10%
and you still see people.

00:42:13.432 --> 00:42:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I'm still
doing it, but no more

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.690 align:middle line:90%
do you have to develop it.

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Now it's time for you
to expand and to do

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.930 align:middle line:90%
something that's just for fun.

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that I did
for fun is take up art again.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.270 align:middle line:90%
I had done it when--

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
a painter before.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.418 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Before
I had kids, Yeah.

00:42:29.418 --> 00:42:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to
pick up art again.

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you, Regina,
in the beginning, I felt--

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:37.470 align:middle line:90%
I would never--

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like an imposter?

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:38.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:43.350 align:middle line:84%
I would never have proclaimed
myself as an artist.

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:48.960 align:middle line:84%
But as I got into it,
I discovered that, wow,

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.270 align:middle line:84%
I actually do have
a gift for this,

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:53.700 align:middle line:84%
for expressing
myself through art.

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:55.830 align:middle line:90%
So that's the accept part.

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:57.540 align:middle line:90%
The next was claim.

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is mine to do, so
I just started doing painting.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:04.020 align:middle line:90%
I actually became obsessed.

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:04.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:05.862 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know you did.

00:43:05.862 --> 00:43:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: I'd do it every day.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And then the next step was
to proclaim, I am an artist.

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:12.462 align:middle line:90%
So I did that.

00:43:12.462 --> 00:43:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we can see
from these images you are.

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely beautiful.

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I said,
I am an artist.

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So I put my work out
there to the world.

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:25.320 align:middle line:10%
And again, the magic
of proclaiming.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:28.590 align:middle line:10%
Prior to that, prior
to proclaiming,

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:30.870 align:middle line:10%
it wouldn't have mattered
how many people told me

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:33.180 align:middle line:10%
I was an artist, I
wouldn't have believed it,

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.040 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't have acted on it.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.700 align:middle line:84%
But the minute that
I proclaimed it,

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.332 align:middle line:84%
then there's no authority out
there that can say otherwise.

00:43:41.332 --> 00:43:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you opened
your little shop door.

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:44.687 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:44.687 --> 00:43:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: So it's a lot of fun.

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:48.130 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful work.

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Again, so many little gems for
people to take home with them.

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:54.910 align:middle line:90%
So I appreciate it.

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So until next time, thank you
so much for taking the time

goes to the same place.
