00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.090 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH:
Let there be light.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.860 align:middle line:10%
This is perhaps the most famous
quote from all creation stories.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.750 align:middle line:10%
From light, matter is formed.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And in short, without
light, nothing

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.850 align:middle line:84%
exists except for the void
and perhaps pure consciousness

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.650 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.230 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when we
disconnect from the light,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.910 align:middle line:90%
as so many of us have?

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Our guest today, Gary
Kiss, explains biophotons

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.180 align:middle line:84%
as the basis of
well-being and healing.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.287 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Gary.

00:00:43.287 --> 00:00:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY KISS: Thank you.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.460 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be here.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I can't
help but ask you this.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.370 align:middle line:90%
Everyone says, what's in a name?

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.370 align:middle line:84%
How did you luck out
and get the name Kiss?

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.395 align:middle line:90%
What a great name.

00:00:50.395 --> 00:00:52.067 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: I have to
talk to my parents.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.053 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:55.053 --> 00:00:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love your name.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.020 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, we want
people to become familiar

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.650 align:middle line:84%
with you and how you
gain this expertise

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:84%
in this phenomenal
field of biophotonics.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So give us some of
your background?

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.960 align:middle line:10%
>> GARY: I really started
learning about biophotonics

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.060 align:middle line:10%
through the study of stem
cells and stem cell research.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.080 align:middle line:10%
And it was really
fascinating that when

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:10%
you look at a cell,
the healthy cells--

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.110 align:middle line:10%
there's a beautiful halo
of energy around it,

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:10%
and the cells that are dying and
depleted had a lack of light,

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:10%
and they were abnormally shaped.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So right away I knew
what does the light have

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:84%
to do with our vitality
and our health.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's what really prompted
my quest of spirituality,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.520 align:middle line:84%
but more importantly,
joining spirituality

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.890 align:middle line:84%
with the convergence of modern
medicine and physical health.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it
all started for me.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.400 align:middle line:84%
As a result of that,
I also started delving

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.440 align:middle line:90%
into the world of parasites.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a wild journey,
but I've learned so much,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and I've brought the pieces
of the puzzle together.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And I really kind of bob and
weave between both worlds

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.060 align:middle line:90%
because we are energy.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.560 align:middle line:90%
We are light.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.170 align:middle line:90%
So this is where my quest began.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:84%
You can't really learn
this stuff in college.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:90%
You don't--

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, no, no, it's
still outside of the box,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.180 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, a bit, but
it's the future of healing.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: It is.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't go to
college to seek knowledge.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, you're right.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:90%
I totally get it.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yeah.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: As a lot of the
brilliant people on our planet

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.910 align:middle line:84%
that are bringing new
innovations forward,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.387 align:middle line:90%
it's not for them.

00:02:36.387 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Some of the people we know
that are among the most

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.347 align:middle line:84%
famed in the world of technology
didn't even have the capacity.

00:02:41.347 --> 00:02:42.805 align:middle line:84%
They barely got
out of high school.

00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:43.605 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yeah.

00:02:43.605 --> 00:02:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So thank you for
sharing that little bit with us.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And you say that our unspoken
problem in our collective health

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.470 align:middle line:84%
and society is
this lack of light.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:90%
So let's pick up on this a bit.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Yes, and it's
not just any light.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:90%
This is biophotonic light.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So tell us
about biophotonic light.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Define it for us?

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Well, the short of
the answer is biophotonic light

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.310 align:middle line:90%
comes from our creator.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:90%
You see, we are made of light.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Fritz-Albert Popp, he
notated that there's 1,000

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.230 align:middle line:84%
biophotons in each
strand of DNA.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:84%
We have 93 trillion
strands of DNA,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.330 align:middle line:84%
so essentially, we
are made of light.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Light is our
communication system.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:38.010 align:middle line:84%
I would like to take the science
one notch up to where our modern

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:84%
day physics cannot or
have not discovered.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
science of our creator.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.720 align:middle line:84%
There was a beautiful
video on the internet,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.780 align:middle line:84%
and it actually shows where
the sperm is meeting the egg,

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and there is a beautiful
bolt of light that comes in.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's a saying,
light is life.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: But they speak of
the explosion that happens,

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and they say this explosion
is a zinc explosion.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.630 align:middle line:84%
But no one can answer you
in the world of science,

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.450 align:middle line:84%
what is that ball
of light coming

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.050 align:middle line:84%
in that intersects with
the sperm and the egg

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.070 align:middle line:90%
at the very exact moment?

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is a
biophoton, which comes

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:84%
from the will of our creator,
which contains all of our codes

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.960 align:middle line:90%
for our DNA.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, that's
beautifully stated.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.000 align:middle line:84%
So when you say that and you
see this little kind of bolt,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.070 align:middle line:84%
then we start thinking
of electricity.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.630 align:middle line:90%
We start thinking of lightning.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So how does light as
energy and how does

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.400 align:middle line:90%
this relate to electricity?

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Because our body is an
electrical vehicle, basically.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yes.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.831 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually a ball of
light, a particle of light.

00:04:54.831 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And within that
particle of light,

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:84%
it contains all of the
light codes for the DNA

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and for the stem
cells, because what

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.780 align:middle line:84%
happens is when the sperm
intersects with the egg

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.750 align:middle line:84%
and it converts into
the X and Y chromosome,

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.190 align:middle line:84%
the biophoton bounces between
the X and Y chromosome,

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:84%
multiplying and
differentiating the stem cells.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:10%
So it's the light that's
creating the differentiation

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.580 align:middle line:10%
within our stem cells.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Without it, we won't be alive.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So this is how we know our
creator is of a light source.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:84%
So now we're living our
lives in the dark these days.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.920 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about light
in the most common sense.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into this by
way of thoughts and emotions,

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.270 align:middle line:84%
the quality of light attached to
certain thoughts and emotions,

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.500 align:middle line:84%
the type of foods we're
eating, whether or not

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:84%
we're static, whether or
not we go out into the sun,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.990 align:middle line:84%
touch the dirt, touch
the water, et cetera.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what we have
become as species because we've

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.210 align:middle line:90%
become so sedentary.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.260 align:middle line:90%
What's happened to us?

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: That's a
fantastic question.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, our light
source is being blocked.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.350 align:middle line:84%
We don't have access to our
source of light in the way

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.190 align:middle line:84%
our ancestors did
for obvious reasons.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:10%
And those reasons are
lack of grounding.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.330 align:middle line:10%
We're not grounded to the earth,
so we cannot discharge all these

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.330 align:middle line:10%
negative energies.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.500 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You mean grounded
as in having our feet walking

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.962 align:middle line:90%
on the soil of the Earth?

00:06:29.962 --> 00:06:30.762 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Correct.

00:06:30.762 --> 00:06:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's a
good point you bring up,

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.405 align:middle line:90%
discharging negative energies.

00:06:35.405 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we'll get back
to that in a minute.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yes.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.660 align:middle line:90%
Another great point is EMFs.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, big time.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: That's massive.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a massive problem,
unseen problem in our society.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.260 align:middle line:10%
Heavy metals.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.120 align:middle line:90%
Stress.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.840 align:middle line:84%
When you combine these factors,
it significantly depletes

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.960 align:middle line:84%
our ability to absorb biophoton
light into the level of the DNA,

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.610 align:middle line:84%
because this is where
everything happens.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Because biophotonic
light triggers

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:84%
every single biochemical process
in the body, every single one,

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
both physically
and energetically.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we're
in a sea of it,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.590 align:middle line:84%
but we're not able to translate
it on a cellular level.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Absolutely right.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Because when we are embellished
with heavy metals and stress

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.565 align:middle line:90%
and EMFs, how can we?

00:07:37.565 --> 00:07:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Our cells-- the space in our
cells there's no space there.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like
you're taking vitamins,

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and the vitamins cannot
be absorbed into the body,

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.110 align:middle line:90%
so you just pass it out.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if your cells had
this space and your muscles

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.110 align:middle line:84%
and your tissues had
this space to absorb it,

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.110 align:middle line:90%
we would assimilate that better.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.293 align:middle line:90%
Same way with light.

00:07:59.293 --> 00:08:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Same thing.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.890 align:middle line:84%
So I'll tell you just a
brief little anecdote.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:84%
So I met this
fellow years ago who

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:84%
used to watch my shows way
back, Conscious Media Network.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you need to
know about discharging

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.190 align:middle line:90%
of electricity.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.600 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere I met
with him along the way

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:20.310 align:middle line:84%
with a couple of people, gave
me a long chain and a clip.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.760 align:middle line:10%
And he said, put a dampened
towel around your neck,

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.930 align:middle line:10%
clip this chain to it, and
run it out onto the ground.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually
kind of shocking,

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.010 align:middle line:90%
and I felt completely different.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.690 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what's going on there?

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: So I would like to
use the analogy of your home.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.039 align:middle line:84%
So our home has an
electrical system.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And if there's too much
voltage what happens

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.420 align:middle line:90%
is we blow out circuitry.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.617 align:middle line:90%
We damage our appliances.

00:08:47.617 --> 00:08:48.450 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Our organs are like
our appliances.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:10%
So when we are
overvoltaged, it actually

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.290 align:middle line:10%
affects the harmonization and
the coherence of our body.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.840 align:middle line:84%
It affects the
structure of our body.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.410 align:middle line:84%
This is why when you did
that, you were able to ground.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a form of grounding.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And you disperse
the energy just like

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:84%
how your home has a rod
that goes into the ground.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere in the world
has a grounding rod.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies work the
same way because we

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.530 align:middle line:90%
are bioelectrical beings.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.220 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So what is creating
all this build up of too much

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.900 align:middle line:10%
electricity or
noxious electricity?

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.190 align:middle line:90%
What's causing that build up?

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: There's a few different
things that creates that build

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.200 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.562 align:middle line:90%
EMFs are one of them.

00:09:30.562 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, makes sense.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Exchange of
energies between people

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.540 align:middle line:84%
because our biofields are
always exchanging energies.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: And heavy metals
because the heavy metals are

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.860 align:middle line:84%
exciting these
energies even more.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.740 align:middle line:84%
So I believe with those factors
and not being able to ground,

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:84%
as God intended, are really
some of the major culprits

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.280 align:middle line:90%
of being overvoltaged.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Overamped.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh, good.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad we talked about
this and brought it

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.315 align:middle line:84%
up, because many people
listening to this will say,

00:10:00.315 --> 00:10:03.090 align:middle line:84%
God, I feel like that, but I've
never known what to do about it.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of people say, get
a grounding blanket and go out

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:90%
and put your feet in the dirt.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.500 align:middle line:90%
There are many ways to do it.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Sure.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now let's talk
about biophotonic emanations

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.437 align:middle line:84%
of thought and emotion
and their effects,

00:10:18.437 --> 00:10:21.020 align:middle line:84%
because we're in a very highly
charged world emotionally right

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:21.450 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Absolutely.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, this really comes
down to coherence.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.940 align:middle line:84%
It's like you have all
of these energies, all

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.970 align:middle line:84%
of these frequencies that's
emitted from thoughts, emitted

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.630 align:middle line:90%
from technologies.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
frequencies interact,

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.890 align:middle line:84%
but it's not interacting
as like a symphony.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not coherent.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.530 align:middle line:90%
It's like a cacophony.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.705 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: It's all
over the place.

00:10:48.705 --> 00:10:51.490 align:middle line:84%
5 feet above the
crown of our head

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.440 align:middle line:84%
is an area called the
information ether.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot of people
talk about this.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.830 align:middle line:10%
And the information
ether is where

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:04.990 align:middle line:10%
things that are being
transmitted from cell phone

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:07.820 align:middle line:10%
towers, from technology,
from streaming.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.430 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have enough
light in our biofield,

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:84%
we're not vibrating
at a fast enough speed

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.870 align:middle line:84%
to disperse those
bits of data that

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:84%
is stuck 5 feet above us,
which directly affects our mind

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:90%
chatter--

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Becomes part
of the incoherence.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: 100%.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so let's
look at what happens then.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.950 align:middle line:90%
OK, I want to talk about this.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So you demonstrate off of
something called a Bovis life

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.753 align:middle line:90%
force chart.

00:11:36.753 --> 00:11:39.170 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what a Bovis-- and
we'll be able to take a look

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.970 align:middle line:90%
at--

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Bovis life force
chart is before we

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.850 align:middle line:84%
get into looking at some
of the numerics and such.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Yeah, so the Bovis
life force chart, created by Dr.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Frederic Bovis, this is a
chart that is used by even

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.710 align:middle line:90%
construction companies.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:53.880 align:middle line:90%
They use dowsing rods.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:59.450 align:middle line:10%
But over the years, they have
charted the different amplitudes

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.390 align:middle line:10%
of energy from different
areas, from Tibet

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:06.050 align:middle line:10%
to star systems to
negative thought forms

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:09.230 align:middle line:10%
to electromagnetic frequencies.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:13.880 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that struck me
really strong was when you look

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:14.860 align:middle line:90%
at 1k.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.855 align:middle line:84%
k is the measure
of energy, kelvins.

00:12:17.855 --> 00:12:20.280 align:middle line:84%
1k is the closest
to death energy.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.180 align:middle line:84%
All of those things
that are created in--

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.050 align:middle line:90%
I call it the negative zone.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.870 align:middle line:10%
The negative zone is
where cancer exists,

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.920 align:middle line:10%
negative thought forms
exists, radiation

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.700 align:middle line:10%
exists, all of those things.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it ironic that
all of the technologies,

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.450 align:middle line:90%
all of the major technologies--

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah, we're
going to get into that--

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: --the negative zone.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.382 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --all of them.

00:12:40.382 --> 00:12:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: So that is suppressing
our natural vibrational

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.330 align:middle line:90%
frequency.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:47.262 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:12:47.262 --> 00:12:49.270 align:middle line:90%
So let's get into a little bit.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.600 align:middle line:90%
You already touched on it.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.430 align:middle line:84%
We see we have this
incoherent field.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
We have negative energy
running in and out blowing

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:01.090 align:middle line:84%
out and making incoherent
our organ function.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.100 align:middle line:10%
And the biophotonic energy
is what actually programs

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.687 align:middle line:10%
our stem cells, our
DNA, everything, right?

00:13:07.687 --> 00:13:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Everything.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.640 align:middle line:84%
So talk about that
process unfettered

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.190 align:middle line:84%
in an ideal world,
what it would look

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.280 align:middle line:84%
like to have ideal
health as a human being?

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Oh, absolutely.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to what we were
saying in the beginning, right?

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: So we have 1,000
photons in each strand of DNA.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.100 align:middle line:84%
We have 93 trillion
strands of DNA.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, when the light comes
in, gets absorbed into the DNA,

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.310 align:middle line:90%
the DNA vibrates.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:40.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the vibration
of the DNA that

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:45.580 align:middle line:84%
creates the physical
body and our biofield.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.960 align:middle line:90%
That's how biofield gets there.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.150 align:middle line:84%
It's the vibration of the DNA
as a result of the light being

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.950 align:middle line:90%
absorbed.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we can use
certain devices like the BioWell

00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.880 align:middle line:84%
device to measure the strength
of the biofield or the density

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.040 align:middle line:84%
of the biofield, which
directly correlates

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.400 align:middle line:90%
with the physical body.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Because we are 85% energy
and 15% physical matter.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: So when something is
happening to us and it's already

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.280 align:middle line:84%
manifesting in
our physical body,

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:21.080 align:middle line:84%
it has already happened to 85%
of what we are, who we are.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.810 align:middle line:84%
When you take a look and you
understand that, oh, my gosh,

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:27.490 align:middle line:84%
light dictates and triggers
every single process

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.440 align:middle line:84%
in the body-- and a
good way to understand

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.390 align:middle line:84%
that is look at the countries
where there's lack of light,

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:36.120 align:middle line:84%
they're higher suicide rates
and higher rates of depression

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.840 align:middle line:84%
versus countries where
there's an abundance of light.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:84%
So it even affects
our neurotransmitters.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, we're looking
at you want to be near light.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:46.800 align:middle line:90%
You want to be near sunshine.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.425 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's one
thing that's obvious

00:14:48.425 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:84%
because part of the story is
the great sun, our great master,

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and teacher and life giver
for our solar system, the sun.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.720 align:middle line:84%
How does the biophotonic
energy in our bodies

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.410 align:middle line:90%
interact with sunlight?

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: So the sun is-- it's
everything to all biological.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, it's everything.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: So biophotons triggers
photosynthesis in plants,

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:13.745 align:middle line:84%
and the same way it triggers
our biochemical processes.

00:15:13.745 --> 00:15:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So it really directly
intercorrelates with everything,

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.460 align:middle line:90%
even on nutrition.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.210 align:middle line:10%
You can take as many
vitamins and supplements

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.940 align:middle line:10%
and go to the gym
every single day,

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.140 align:middle line:10%
which will give you
physical health,

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.150 align:middle line:10%
but it's not going to
give you spiritual health.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:84%
But spiritual health, which
comes from biophotons, which

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.510 align:middle line:84%
comes from natural light,
the light of the creator

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.980 align:middle line:90%
can give you nutritional health.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So to intentionally
expose ourselves to natural

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:49.720 align:middle line:84%
light is going to essentially
optimize all of the other

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.910 align:middle line:84%
functions that are
happening in the body?

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Yes, because it's
the only form, this light.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:03.700 align:middle line:84%
It has every single component
within that particle

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:09.830 align:middle line:84%
that can actually penetrate
every single layer of our body.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.630 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing else
that can do that.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And yet we are more
and more removing ourselves from

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:15.920 align:middle line:90%
sunlight.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Not only that we are
more and more removing ourselves

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.310 align:middle line:90%
from sunlight.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:23.440 align:middle line:84%
The attack is on our
light through EMFs,

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.460 align:middle line:84%
through negative energies,
through just the perpetuation

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:90%
of negativity, through chaos.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: And through heavy
metals and through lack

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.640 align:middle line:90%
of grounding.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So all of these things
really, really promotes

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:43.080 align:middle line:90%
the lack of light in our body.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.305 align:middle line:84%
It really demotes
that, I would say.

00:16:45.305 --> 00:16:46.105 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And then we distract
ourselves with technology,

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.200 align:middle line:84%
which we'll get into
in a moment, which

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%
keeps us further removed
from natural light sources.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yes.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.850 align:middle line:84%
The problem is even if
we went into the sun,

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:03.750 align:middle line:84%
we cannot absorb the
light like we once did.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:90%
This is the problem.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.819 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed pre-pandemic
when you meditated,

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:11.540 align:middle line:84%
you could have meditated, and
you tuned up your chakras, all

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.569 align:middle line:84%
of your energy centers,
and you felt great probably

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:16.170 align:middle line:90%
almost for the entire day.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:90%
You felt that sense of clarity.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:21.200 align:middle line:84%
Post-pandemic, you
probably have to do

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.030 align:middle line:84%
the same thing, the
same meditation,

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:26.197 align:middle line:84%
five times to accomplish
what you felt.

00:17:26.197 --> 00:17:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you know we
were going to get into this

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:90%
at some point.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:29.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: OK.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So post-Covid,
quite a few issues that became

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.550 align:middle line:90%
permanent within the human body.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really settled in.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.130 align:middle line:84%
We started suffering from
more chronic conditions.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And that just seems
to be a given.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And we can start
breaking it down.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:84%
It depends on which medical
websites you read, but I think

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:56.640 align:middle line:84%
it's fair to say the human
immune system in mass

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.330 align:middle line:90%
was compromised with COVID.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yes, 100%.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I would
say whether you caught it

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:07.860 align:middle line:84%
in the wild, whether you
had the shots, nonetheless,

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.750 align:middle line:84%
you were exposed to
that central element.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:12.550 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yes.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what happened
to us that you started seeing

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:22.292 align:middle line:84%
biophotonics after the world was
exposed to the spike protein?

00:18:22.292 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: I want to bring this up
specifically in relation to that

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.820 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.480 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, the world
became experts on mRNA.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, they did.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Out of the blue.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:33.280 align:middle line:90%
Hmm, OK.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little
bit about that

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.620 align:middle line:90%
because it directly relates.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.740 align:middle line:90%
So this is how our body works.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.990 align:middle line:84%
When light comes into our
system, it's absorbed.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.930 align:middle line:84%
It creates that
vibration through the DNA

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:47.500 align:middle line:90%
which builds out our biofield.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:84%
The biofield acts as
a recording device.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.990 align:middle line:84%
It's constantly recording
everything in our reality,

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:middle line:90%
consciously or unconsciously--

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Like
storing information.

00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Correct.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:90%
Exactly that.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Our DNA acts as
a fractal antenna

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:84%
receiving that information
constantly from the biofield.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And then there is a process
between the DNA and the RNA.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And explain the
DNA-RNA process for people?

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Yes, the DNA
acts as a fractal antenna.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.545 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to really break
this down into an analogy

00:19:18.545 --> 00:19:19.420 align:middle line:90%
so people can get it.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Good.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: There's a process
of conversion that's called

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:26.830 align:middle line:84%
transcription in the medical
world from the DNA to the RNA.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.100 align:middle line:90%
So basically, it's translating.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.870 align:middle line:84%
The DNA that
transcription process,

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:35.490 align:middle line:84%
it's a translator through
different proteins

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and configurations of proteins,
so the RNA can read it.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.488 align:middle line:84%
And the RNA acts
as a projector--

00:19:41.488 --> 00:19:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's the expression.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: --of that
information, the expression,

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.685 align:middle line:84%
which directly
affects our reality.

00:19:47.685 --> 00:19:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: One is the receptor,
and one is the expression.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:53.787 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: So if that
process between the DNA--

00:19:53.787 --> 00:19:54.995 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The transcription.

00:19:54.995 --> 00:19:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: --the transcription

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Is corrupted.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: --is

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.640 align:middle line:84%

of weird stuff.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: All right then.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you are
tampering with that,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.203 align:middle line:84%
you are literally tampering
with our connection to source.

00:20:10.203 --> 00:20:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There were patents
for the spike protein.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:13.870 align:middle line:84%
We know a lot of
things about it now

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.350 align:middle line:84%
because everybody was able
to research it over time,

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.350 align:middle line:90%
in hindsight.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And that this cleaves
directly into the cells.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's made to
cleave into the cell.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:22.895 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: It's like warfare.

00:20:22.895 --> 00:20:24.680 align:middle line:84%
People like to call
it spiritual warfare.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.600 align:middle line:84%
I like to say it's
light warfare.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It was light warfare.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So once this happened
and the immune system

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:34.160 align:middle line:84%
of the human
species was reduced,

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.630 align:middle line:90%
lowered, made less efficient--

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:36.430 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Correct.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.850 align:middle line:10%
a lack of well-being has
happened since COVID.

how do we start reestablishing
biophotonic health in the body

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.590 align:middle line:84%
post all of this, with the
corruption in the transcription,

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:43.800 align:middle line:84%
I've got that
written right here.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.630 align:middle line:10%
So there are now
technologies coming then

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.540 align:middle line:10%
that can start reversing
the negative effects

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:10%
of other interventions
of a negative kind,

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:54.780 align:middle line:10%
other technologies.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So on the Bovis scale
there was something

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.950 align:middle line:84%
that you mentioned earlier,
all of the technologies

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:04.730 align:middle line:84%
that are being foisted
upon humanity, gifted

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:08.360 align:middle line:84%
to humanity for those who want
to use them and choose to engage

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.760 align:middle line:84%
with them, are on the Bovis
scale in the negative, correct?

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yes.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.227 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Talk about
that a little bit.

00:22:15.227 --> 00:22:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: So between 1k and
6k, that's in the negative

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.475 align:middle line:90%
to lower--

00:22:20.475 --> 00:22:23.080 align:middle line:84%
the zone of lower
frequencies or low energy.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:84%
When you start coming off of 8k,
that's someone in fairly good

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.690 align:middle line:90%
health.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:31.710 align:middle line:84%
When you start going into 14k,
that's moving into the frequency

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:32.670 align:middle line:90%
of a church bell.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Where did all the
church bells go?

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:38.850 align:middle line:84%
When you start moving into
different mountainous regions

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:84%
like Tibet, that's
where it goes up to 40k,

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:46.390 align:middle line:84%
the Sirius star
system, 50k, 100k.

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What is the highest
rated site or place or field

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.360 align:middle line:84%
that they've been able to
measure on the Bovis scale?

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: A biophoton.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A biophoton.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.120 align:middle line:90%
OK, biophotons

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Why?

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Because it comes
from our creator.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.660 align:middle line:84%
It has the highest
vibrational frequency of life.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:90%
It is the imprint for life.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.290 align:middle line:90%
OK, all right.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:90%
So we get an idea.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.350 align:middle line:84%
That's when you're
scooching on up to scale.

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yes.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.865 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now let's scooch
on down into the negative end

00:23:13.865 --> 00:23:15.050 align:middle line:90%
of the Bovis scale.

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:16.520 align:middle line:90%
And what do we see?

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Oh, cancer.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But what about
the technologies when

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.650 align:middle line:84%
they're registering
the technologies?

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: 5G cell phone towers.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're in
the negative number?

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:32.535 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Yeah, that's
specifically 3,000 kelvins, 3k.

00:23:32.535 --> 00:23:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: In the negative?

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: In the negative.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:35.835 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's not good.

00:23:35.835 --> 00:23:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: 1k is close to
just death, close to death.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.370 align:middle line:90%
That's cancer and death.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What else is
in the negative zone?

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Negative thought forms.

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're having
a lot of that projected onto

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.470 align:middle line:84%
humanity that are not
coming from our own minds.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Correct

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is the one
thing that bothers me is even

00:23:56.570 --> 00:24:00.540 align:middle line:84%
the ability to have a sovereign
mind is almost impossible--

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.892 align:middle line:84%
not impossible,
almost impossible.

00:24:02.892 --> 00:24:04.850 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
that, and then you're

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:08.190 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about what this
is doing to our free will.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:09.660 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:13.101 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Free will
has been hijacked.

00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Free will is
essentially the ability

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.978 align:middle line:84%
to make a decision purely
with your own discussion.

00:24:18.978 --> 00:24:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: With your
own knowingness.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: With your knowingness.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.952 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Whether you made
the right decision or a wrong

00:24:23.952 --> 00:24:26.160 align:middle line:84%
decision, you made
it on your own.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:31.000 align:middle line:84%
But when you have a million
voices, heavy mind chatter,

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.680 align:middle line:84%
heavy levels of anxiety,
how can you get access

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.750 align:middle line:90%
to that one true voice anymore?

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is where part of our
free will has been hijacked

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:90%
or it's been interrupted.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And you can go to
church seven days

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.840 align:middle line:84%
a week, praise the
Lord seven days a week.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.540 align:middle line:84%
But if you have anxiety
and mind chatter,

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:55.230 align:middle line:84%
you cannot connect to
that divine source.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:59.702 align:middle line:84%
And it's directly correlated
to heavy parasitic loads.

00:24:59.702 --> 00:25:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's where
I was going to go next.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.400 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's talk about parasites.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.960 align:middle line:90%
They're alive and well.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.920 align:middle line:90%
They're thriving.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.638 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: They are thriving
more than ever, more than ever.

00:25:08.638 --> 00:25:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, let's
talk about that.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the difference
between beneficial bacteria

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.260 align:middle line:90%
and parasites.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
parasites are thriving,

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.780 align:middle line:84%
and that may not be
so good because we

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.310 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of them in us.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:22.670 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk about why.

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.878 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Well, I'm going to
break it down very simply

00:25:24.878 --> 00:25:28.150 align:middle line:84%
through a real-life
experience that I've had.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So I had a couple Harvard
doctors, microbiologists there.

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:34.510 align:middle line:84%
At the time, we were doing
the live blood cell analysis.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:37.390 align:middle line:84%
There was this young
woman that came in--

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.100 align:middle line:84%
vegan all of her life,
married to the same guy,

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.180 align:middle line:90%
stay-at-home mom.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.410 align:middle line:90%
She was very sick.

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.770 align:middle line:84%
She brought her blood work
to us, and we're all looking.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Basically, her
symptomology was not

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.188 align:middle line:90%
matching up to her blood tests.

00:25:51.188 --> 00:25:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What was
the symptomology?

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Oh, she was having--

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.740 align:middle line:90%
a lot of voices, depression.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Random pains, arthritic pain.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:06.915 align:middle line:84%
And it would come out of
nowhere depending on the day.

00:26:06.915 --> 00:26:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:08.780 align:middle line:90%
You said voices first.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yes.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.458 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of brain fog.

00:26:12.458 --> 00:26:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, brain fog.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: At the first glance
looking at the blood test, OK,

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:19.500 align:middle line:90%
everything looks according.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:24.810 align:middle line:84%
When we put the live blood
cells under the microscope,

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:26.450 align:middle line:90%
we saw a little bit of activity.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:31.590 align:middle line:84%
When we put the biophotonic
light, after 15 minutes,

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:35.720 align:middle line:84%
we started seeing all
these pathogens pouring out

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.000 align:middle line:90%
from inside of the cell.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't being
detected by the test.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This is like sci-fi.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.437 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: It really is.

00:26:41.437 --> 00:26:44.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like a whole
different world out there.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: In us.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yes.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.780 align:middle line:90%
Everything started matching up.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my gosh, it's that type of
parasite, that type of virus.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.020 align:middle line:84%
That type of pathogen.
Let's just summarize it.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:90%
And then I was like, oh.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:84%
The light bulbs started
going off for me.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:01.850 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you a vegan?

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Aren't you married
to the same guy?

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you a stay-at-home mom?

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:09.310 align:middle line:84%
How do you have these type
of pathogens in the blood?

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:13.700 align:middle line:10%
Look like you were with a random
guy at the bus stop every week.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Really it looked like that.

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: How did you
manage to do that?

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.365 align:middle line:84%

00:27:18.365 --> 00:27:21.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.290 align:middle line:84%

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:25.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm a healer.

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: What do you
mean you're a healer?

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean if
I give you $100,

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:33.910 align:middle line:84%
you will impart your good
energy and take my bad energy?

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Energy you need
transfers, right?

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yeah, basically.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:39.275 align:middle line:84%
How long have you
been doing that?

00:27:39.275 --> 00:27:41.632 align:middle line:90%
Oh, for the past 12 years.

00:27:41.632 --> 00:27:43.215 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know what
started happening?

00:27:43.215 --> 00:27:44.015 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What?

00:27:44.015 --> 00:27:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: The more she did
and conducted healings,

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.730 align:middle line:84%
she started accumulating all
of these energies through

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:54.100 align:middle line:84%
the biofield through the
exchange of energy through

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.340 align:middle line:90%
the biofield.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And as that happened, and
she's not connected to source,

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:03.010 align:middle line:84%
she kept lowering and
lowering and lowering

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:04.550 align:middle line:90%
her vibrational frequency.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And when she resonated with
the frequency of that pathogen,

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.530 align:middle line:84%
it was able to come
into her system.

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the transfer of
pathogens through the biofield

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:17.610 align:middle line:84%
works, because there are
pathogens here as we speak.

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:20.010 align:middle line:84%
But what keeps them
out from entering?

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:21.650 align:middle line:90%
It's the biofield.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's not
a frequency match--

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: It's not

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --in a certain field.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: That's right.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:25.883 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Or it is.

00:28:25.883 --> 00:28:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And so you're saying
in mass and especially

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.950 align:middle line:84%
since COVID, which had
massive levels of depression,

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.950 align:middle line:84%
as well as these physical
elements we've talked about,

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:37.310 align:middle line:84%
we've resonated at
a low enough rate

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:40.350 align:middle line:84%
that the parasites are having
a field day inside our bodies.

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Yes, and parasites can
be transferred through EMFs.

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.820 align:middle line:90%
So you can stream parasites.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Whoa, whoa!

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, share that one again.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: OK, let me back up.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I
think you need to.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.073 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: --It's on
my actual research.

00:28:54.073 --> 00:28:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: When we started asking
about these parasites when we

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.920 align:middle line:84%
saw it in the blood, I
asked, how are these things

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:04.150 align:middle line:84%
so intelligent when it's
an acellular organism,

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:05.530 align:middle line:90%
it's a one-cell organism.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:06.960 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have a brain.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Where is it getting
its intelligence from?

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:12.370 align:middle line:90%


00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:13.710 align:middle line:90%
Uh, uh--

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Uh.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:14.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: I got three
different answers.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, Uh.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Well, we can pop
some antibiotics in there,

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.040 align:middle line:84%
kill a few, but the rest are
going to hide and recolonize.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.990 align:middle line:90%
So it's highly intelligent.

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:29.650 align:middle line:84%
But no one can answer me where
is the intelligence coming from.

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:30.450 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:32.417 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't
learn that in school.

00:29:32.417 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So where
is it coming from?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: It's coming
from an outside source,

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:40.205 align:middle line:84%
which comes from a lower
vibrational frequency.

00:29:40.205 --> 00:29:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What is
that outside source?

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Well, different--

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You can say--

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Religion.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's call it a dark source
for lack of better words.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.210 align:middle line:84%
A darker, intelligent source of
a lower vibrational frequency.

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:53.010 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Because the parasite thrived in
lack of light and lack of oxygen

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.100 align:middle line:90%
and acidic environment.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.047 align:middle line:84%
So it actually thrived
in the environments--

00:30:03.047 --> 00:30:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That kills you.

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:05.088 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: That kills us.

00:30:05.088 --> 00:30:06.455 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:30:06.455 --> 00:30:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: That was an
eye-opener for me.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
that's an eye popper.

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:10.235 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: So it's like this.

00:30:10.235 --> 00:30:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Wow, this is thriving in the
environment where we're dying,

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.595 align:middle line:84%
and when we're
thriving, they're dying.

00:30:15.595 --> 00:30:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, now, let's just
for a moment talk about bacteria

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.690 align:middle line:90%
and give them their due.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Well--

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Good bacteria.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: --there
are good bacteria.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Obviously, we
are made up of bacteria.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we don't
conflate the two.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Good.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So there are good
bacteria that which

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:34.123 align:middle line:84%
we are made of which thrives on
the same things we thrive on.

00:30:34.123 --> 00:30:35.290 align:middle line:90%
So we're not talking about--

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Like the
nutrition, et cetera.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: --the good guys.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, like probiotics and
prebiotics and those things.

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:39.950 align:middle line:90%
So these are good.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:41.990 align:middle line:90%
So those are the good guys.

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:45.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is not to be mistaken
with certain parasites.

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:47.210 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the dark parasites.

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So there are so
many technologies out there.

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Some of them very beautiful
like near and far-red light

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:56.480 align:middle line:84%
technologies that are being used
even clinically, very easily,

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.490 align:middle line:84%
comfortably in
saunas, et cetera.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So let's start there
and talk about what

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:01.380 align:middle line:90%
those technologies do.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Are they affecting parasites
or more the heavy metals

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:06.360 align:middle line:84%
or more-- what are
they affecting?

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: They're not really
affecting parasites as such.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.510 align:middle line:84%
They are affecting heavy
metals because it's

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:12.750 align:middle line:90%
working through the skin.

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.580 align:middle line:84%
It's detoxifying
through the skin.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.140 align:middle line:90%
The skin is the largest organ.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.680 align:middle line:84%
So when we could sweat things
out, we essentially moving

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.030 align:middle line:90%
toxins out of the body.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So light creates-- even
though, like, for example,

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.490 align:middle line:90%
red light therapy, great.

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:28.520 align:middle line:90%
But it's still synthetic light.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:32.160 align:middle line:84%
It's only affecting a
certain layer of us.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:36.060 align:middle line:84%
So I think those are
great modalities,

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:40.140 align:middle line:84%
but it's not getting
down into the DNA.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, it seems that
most of the clinics use it

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:48.320 align:middle line:84%
for muscle strain, pain,
being able to relieve some

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.060 align:middle line:84%
inflammation, for
beauty clinics,

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.227 align:middle line:90%
inflammation in the skin.

00:31:52.227 --> 00:31:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Absolutely.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So like you say skin
deep or muscle deep it will go,

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:57.360 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't go to the DNA.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: No.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we
really need the help,

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:04.270 align:middle line:84%
because your body only reacts
positively to something

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:09.140 align:middle line:84%
it's made from, and we reject
what we're not made from.

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.130 align:middle line:90%
So this is why light therapies--

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and let me just
differentiate something here.

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:18.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of devices that
call themselves photon therapy,

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:21.910 align:middle line:84%
but there's a difference
between photon therapy

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:24.148 align:middle line:90%
and biological photons.

00:32:24.148 --> 00:32:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Explain the
difference because I'm sure some

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.250 align:middle line:84%
of the people watching
have played with it.

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yes.

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:31.540 align:middle line:90%
So photons are your light.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.290 align:middle line:84%
You turn on your lights
with your photons,

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:36.170 align:middle line:90%
but they're not of nature.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:37.130 align:middle line:90%
They're synthetic.

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:38.930 align:middle line:90%
It still relies on a source.

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.550 align:middle line:90%
It still relies on electricity.

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:44.360 align:middle line:84%
While electricity--
there's dirty electricity.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not a pure source.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.980 align:middle line:84%
So light is simulating
something of nature.

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So there's a simulation
of a natural frequency.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So anything that has to
be plugged in is a photon.

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is
solving something for me.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:00.000 align:middle line:90%
OK, just bear with me, everyone.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.390 align:middle line:84%
So past life regression, back
in Atlantis I worked as a healer

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:05.720 align:middle line:84%
but using colored
energy and light.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And what we did--
and at the time,

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.770 align:middle line:84%
I thought, but they
outwit electricity.

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:10.920 align:middle line:90%
That's not what we did.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.220 align:middle line:10%
There was an aperture
where the sun came

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.980 align:middle line:10%
in at certain times of
the day, and then we

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:20.600 align:middle line:10%
would put a silk
sheet over the person

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:25.220 align:middle line:10%
and allow the sun to shine
through this natural fabric

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.910 align:middle line:10%
with this color in it.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And they were natural
dyes, and that

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:31.950 align:middle line:84%
was how we were using
color therapy in the day.

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:33.560 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
that was plugged in.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm a big fan of the
notion of modern color therapy.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:40.250 align:middle line:10%
Plug in your light, put
a gel on it, go for it.

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:43.220 align:middle line:84%
But you just explain why
we were doing it that way

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.120 align:middle line:84%
because we knew how
to do it naturally.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: That's right.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm not against those things.

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:48.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm not knocking
anything, but I'm just--

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They do
have effectiveness--

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: They do.

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --it's not maybe as
deep and as pure as something

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:57.040 align:middle line:84%
that originates from our
great sun, for example,

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.000 align:middle line:90%
or our own bodies.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: And it's really the
understanding of what are

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:03.990 align:middle line:90%
sources and what are resources.

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Sources comes from our
creator, which is light.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Resources are-- you
can go to the gym

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.389 align:middle line:84%
and gain physical energy
by going to the gym.

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:19.210 align:middle line:84%
That's a resource, but
it's quickly depleted.

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:21.190 align:middle line:84%
It does not affect
us spiritually.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:24.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like having
an expensive car.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:25.810 align:middle line:90%
You have a Ferrari.

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:28.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful source
of this beautiful car.

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:31.000 align:middle line:84%
But you put $87
gas inside of it.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Would it run?

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.199 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but after time,
it's going to draw

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:36.210 align:middle line:90%
from the sources of the car.

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:38.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's important to understand
that sources or a lot

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:42.000 align:middle line:84%
of these therapies out there,
they'll give you resources,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.250 align:middle line:84%
but it's not going to
replenish your source energy.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:47.505 align:middle line:84%
You can only get source
energy from the source.

00:34:47.505 --> 00:34:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: From the source.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:53.020 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we need to talk about
this because we couldn't have

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.980 align:middle line:84%
even talked about
this a few days ago,

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.560 align:middle line:84%
but you got some
scientific research.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And, like you said,
you and your team

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:00.290 align:middle line:84%
have been working
with this conundrum,

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:04.150 align:middle line:84%
trying to find a natural,
organic, biophotonic solution

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:05.300 align:middle line:90%
for humanity.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And you seem that
you've done it.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.290 align:middle line:10%
And so I want you to tell
us what you've just learned,

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:13.300 align:middle line:10%
because this has to do with the
Bio-Well, which is Konstantin

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.770 align:middle line:10%
Korotkov's original technology.

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And anyone here at Gaia
knows we've done some shows

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.000 align:middle line:90%
on the Bio-Well.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.960 align:middle line:90%
It's big deal.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what you found out.

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:26.300 align:middle line:84%
This is the device
that you have?

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yes.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's testing
on a group of people?

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yes.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A couple
dozen people.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yes.

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, tell
us what happened.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Well, just to put the
cherry on top here with that,

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.150 align:middle line:84%
we have so many beautiful people
that's bringing light in, which

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:42.820 align:middle line:90%
we call healers.

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:43.885 align:middle line:90%
Who's healing the healer?

00:35:43.885 --> 00:35:46.570 align:middle line:84%
There is only one place you
can heal the healer, which

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:47.390 align:middle line:90%
is the source.

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:48.965 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: So with
that being said,

00:35:48.965 --> 00:35:52.530 align:middle line:84%
we've created this technology
that you spoke of which is

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:55.350 align:middle line:84%
the purest biophoton
in the world.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Prior to coming here, we've
done certain measurements

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:00.790 align:middle line:90%
with Bio-Well.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And we were streaming
the biophotons

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:06.210 align:middle line:90%
through the internet, which is--

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
that's kind of crazy.

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't get--
talk about transcription.

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.310 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't get corrupted.

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:16.770 align:middle line:84%
The light can travel and end
up on the other end pure.

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: I love that you brought
that up because bionature

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:24.180 align:middle line:84%
or biophoton has a neutral
charge and a positive charge.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And the observer can
actually affect the photon

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:30.430 align:middle line:84%
through the neutral charge
as the door is open.

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:35.410 align:middle line:84%
We have programmed the biophoton
with a double positive charge.

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And we've created one
specific biophoton

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.310 align:middle line:84%
to harmonize the
energy of the internet,

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:44.440 align:middle line:90%
so it does not get corrupted.

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So it creates like that
funnel or that tunnel

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.330 align:middle line:84%
for the photon to
travel through when

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:51.050 align:middle line:90%
it's streaming directly to you.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And there is zero
corruption of the biophoton.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.510 align:middle line:90%
It actually humanizes the EMFs.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you did these
studies using that technology

00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.290 align:middle line:90%
through the internet.

00:36:59.290 --> 00:36:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: 100%

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Some people
did a before scan.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:07.060 align:middle line:84%
We streamed the energy through
the internet being received

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:11.650 align:middle line:84%
on their phone or their laptop,
and then we did a post scan.

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:15.910 align:middle line:90%
And the results were astounding.

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, when
you walked in today,

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.130 align:middle line:84%
I thought we got
to talk about this.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yes.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:24.040 align:middle line:84%
I can take a 20-minute session
of receiving biophotonic light

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.400 align:middle line:84%
through your phone or through
your computer and increase

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:32.155 align:middle line:84%
your cardiovascular
system by over 50%.

00:37:32.155 --> 00:37:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Crazy.

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Sounds too good to be true.

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Yeah,
but you know what?

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:37.820 align:middle line:90%
That's not me.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.080 align:middle line:90%
That's third party research.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the beautiful part
of what I can now say.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, no.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Konstantin Korotkov
he's the real deal.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.738 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: He's the real deal.

00:37:46.738 --> 00:37:48.530 align:middle line:10%
We used to look at so
many of the devices--

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:50.113 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Soviet
Academy of Sciences.

00:37:50.113 --> 00:37:51.360 align:middle line:90%
This guy is the real deal.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: I mean, this is why
it's a medical device and other

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:54.590 align:middle line:90%
countries.

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: The accuracy
is astounding.

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And when we could increase
the liver function, thyroid

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:02.600 align:middle line:84%
function, cardiovascular
function--

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Respiratory--

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.613 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: --respiratory
function by 66%.

00:38:05.613 --> 00:38:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When we talking
about this, that's what got me,

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:11.240 align:middle line:84%
because so many people's
bronchia and lungs were impacted

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.430 align:middle line:84%
by COVID, weakened and
never fully recovered.

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Correct because
it's not a physical thing.

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:22.190 align:middle line:84%
This is an energetic blockage
it's creating in the system.

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:25.070 align:middle line:84%
It's embedding a
code in the system

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:26.810 align:middle line:84%
which affects,
because if you don't

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:28.060 align:middle line:90%
have enough oxygen coming in--

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.102 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You add karma.

00:38:29.102 --> 00:38:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: --it creates anxiety.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.220 align:middle line:90%
It creates mind chatter.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.478 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: And you're not getting
enough light because oxygen

00:38:35.478 --> 00:38:36.930 align:middle line:90%
needs the light to perpetuate.

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:37.860 align:middle line:10%
This is exactly how--

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.910 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: OK, so this is what
you guys needed to hear to bump

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:43.260 align:middle line:10%
you up a notch in confidence
out there in the world.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yes.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's
a big green light.

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yes.

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:47.763 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: God, this is amazing.

00:38:47.763 --> 00:38:51.898 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have to tell you, I
worry about you a little bit.

00:38:51.898 --> 00:38:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: When you're on your

you're in your passion,

00:38:57.347 --> 00:38:59.180 align:middle line:84%
you're willing to put
your life on the line.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that's true.

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Because
it's bigger than you.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's bigger than you.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:02.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:04.783 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: And no one can
stop this right now.

00:39:04.783 --> 00:39:06.038 align:middle line:90%
It's out there.

00:39:06.038 --> 00:39:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's
already out there.

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: Yeah, we
just released it.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Where is it at?

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:10.810 align:middle line:84%
In different countries
or everywhere, anywhere?

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:11.870 align:middle line:90%
I guess, it's on the internet.

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yeah, anywhere.

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:13.532 align:middle line:90%
You could subscribe.

00:39:13.532 --> 00:39:15.800 align:middle line:84%
It's through the internet,
so you can subscribe to it.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What is the
device called, by the way?

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:17.888 align:middle line:90%
I never asked you that.

00:39:17.888 --> 00:39:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: It's called the
biohealingstream.com.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:21.850 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:22.160 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: That's
what it's called.

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We'll mention
that, because I certainly,

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:26.110 align:middle line:90%
I want to dive into it a bit.

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:29.155 align:middle line:90%


00:39:29.155 --> 00:39:32.680 align:middle line:84%
It makes me irate that
our energy fields have

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.010 align:middle line:90%
been so tampered with.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:34.790 align:middle line:90%

But you know what?

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:40.850 align:middle line:10%
It also helps me understand that
that's about to come to an end,

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:43.670 align:middle line:10%
because people like you
and others on this planet

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:45.275 align:middle line:10%
exist and are
doing what they do.

00:39:45.275 --> 00:39:47.400 align:middle line:84%
You're willing to put your
life on the line for it,

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.690 align:middle line:84%
as many people are,
disseminating information even.

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:53.270 align:middle line:84%
That means those
dark days are now

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:56.790 align:middle line:84%
dying, because the prevailing
consciousness of our planet,

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:00.170 align:middle line:84%
of our cosmos, will not
allow for that dark energy

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:01.950 align:middle line:90%
to stay in control much longer.

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:04.590 align:middle line:84%
So I feel this is just breaking
through to the other side.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:05.480 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: 100%.

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So even the stream
is how it's designed

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:12.140 align:middle line:84%
is not just designed
for someone's well-being

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.030 align:middle line:84%
physically and spiritually,
but a percentage of the energy

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:18.560 align:middle line:84%
we have created a photon
specifically to help raise

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.730 align:middle line:90%
the frequency of the planet.

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:21.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: And a percentage of the
energy goes to harmonize general

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.740 align:middle line:84%
consciousness because
that's where the chaos is.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: So every time
someone clicks on that stream,

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:33.870 align:middle line:90%
it's not just you.

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:36.370 align:middle line:84%
You're helping the planet, and
you're helping consciousness.

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You know
what, thank you so much.

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for all of your
research, your dedication,

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.300 align:middle line:90%
and hard work.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful thing
you've done here.

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:45.800 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait to play with it.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Thank you.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.280 align:middle line:10%
And thank you for giving
me-- because there's not

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.930 align:middle line:10%
a lot of places you can
talk about this openly.

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:52.880 align:middle line:10%
Even when you said
certain words, I was like,

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.620 align:middle line:10%
oh, I can't believe
she said that.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, then
they get edited out.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:56.670 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yeah, well, it's OK.

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But
nonetheless, I mean,

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:00.560 align:middle line:84%
I feel in fairness
to our audience,

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.260 align:middle line:84%
we need to talk about the things
that are plaguing humanity.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.250 align:middle line:90%
It's only fair.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Yes.

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We should not be kept
like mushrooms in the dark any

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:07.950 align:middle line:90%
longer.

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:09.940 align:middle line:90%
We need biophotonic light.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY: We do because it's the
light of our creator it's what

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:13.280 align:middle line:90%
we're made from.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Mr. Kiss.

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:17.040 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so jealous of your name.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>> GARY: Thank you.

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:21.340 align:middle line:84%
It's an honor and pleasure
to be here with you.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.340 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: For more information
on Gary Kiss' work in this

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:28.400 align:middle line:10%
field, you can go to his
website at biohealingstream.com.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.520 align:middle line:10%
So let's get lit up
again and let's heal.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
