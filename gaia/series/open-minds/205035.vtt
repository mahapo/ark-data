>>REGINA MEREDITH: The one
thing I think we've all learned

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.820 align:middle line:10%
is that it's now time to take
up the challenge of creating

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.860 align:middle line:10%
a robust immune system.

Katrine Volynsky is
here with us once again

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.120 align:middle line:84%
to give us some really
insightful information on how

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.047 align:middle line:84%

affecting our immune system,

00:00:34.047 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:84%
plus we're going to
talk about the solution.

So we won't leave you depressed
at the end of all of this

00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:40.060 align:middle line:90%
because, yikes, I don't--

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't think, and certainly
in my short history on Earth,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
I have not seen such
collective fear and anxiety.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.970 align:middle line:90%
Nothing close.

>>KATRINE VOLYNSKY: It's
unprecedented times, you know,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.980 align:middle line:90%
as everybody says.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's definitely
time to relook

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.760 align:middle line:84%
at how we're
spending our energy,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:84%
where's it going, what
is our mind doing,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:90%
how is the body responding.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we are going
to be seeing more and more

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:84%
is, this type of situation
is going to create

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.530 align:middle line:84%
more psychological distractions
and problems in the health

break some of this down,

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.620 align:middle line:84%

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.060 align:middle line:84%

of fear and anxiety.

>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah,
my child is 5 now.

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:49.690 align:middle line:90%

Yeah, before he was born.

years ago, when

and our previous
conversation we did talk

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.060 align:middle line:84%
about fear and anxiety,
and what was happening

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.040 align:middle line:84%
to people in Chernobyl,
and how much stress

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:84%
was killing more people
than the radiation itself.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.450 align:middle line:84%

it's an emotional state
that is natural to us.

Let me ask you about that.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if we did talk
about it in the last interview

What happened among the people's
emotions and minds collectively

00:02:54.042 --> 00:02:55.000 align:middle line:90%
there, and your family?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: It was scary.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.320 align:middle line:90%
It was scary.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.903 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone
went into deep fear

00:02:57.903 --> 00:03:00.550 align:middle line:84%
right away, because they knew
what the potential consequences

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:90%
were.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.327 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And
at that time, this

00:03:02.327 --> 00:03:04.990 align:middle line:84%
was the first major
nuclear event.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.540 align:middle line:84%
So you really didn't know
how bad it's going to be.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.520 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
questioning, or what's

going to happen
to your offspring

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.598 align:middle line:84%
as a young mother, or even
as a girl getting older,

00:03:15.598 --> 00:03:17.140 align:middle line:84%
what's going to
happen to your child,

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.950 align:middle line:84%
or even if you're
going to have children.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.850 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of
uncertainty about the future,

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:84%
not knowing how it's going to
affect you in the short term.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:84%
But also really being
afraid for your health

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.735 align:middle line:90%
and the health of your children.

00:03:28.735 --> 00:03:29.920 align:middle line:90%

00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes, and he is
definitely a miracle baby that

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.280 align:middle line:90%
was not something--

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.363 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was not easy.

00:03:38.363 --> 00:03:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: It was not easy,
and it wasn't supposed to be.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.322 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't supposed
to metabolically be

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:44.170 align:middle line:90%
able to have a child like this.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And through the power of
self-healing and prayer

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.470 align:middle line:90%
and just--

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and I wouldn't say that I was
trying to have a child, either.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.487 align:middle line:84%
He just came into my
life, but it was amazing.

00:03:55.487 --> 00:03:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you had dedicated
yourself for a long time

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.970 align:middle line:84%
prior to that to

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.670 align:middle line:84%
the true principles
of life, metabolism,

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.190 align:middle line:84%
the basics of what allow

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.638 align:middle line:90%
us to live well in a body.

00:04:07.638 --> 00:04:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people that
know you-- and I'll just

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.638 align:middle line:90%
toot your horn for you.

00:04:10.638 --> 00:04:13.030 align:middle line:84%
But people who know
you, and people

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.450 align:middle line:84%
in esoteric and medical
circles, all say she's a genius.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
capacity and intellect

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.792 align:middle line:84%
that's able to put pieces
together that is very rare.

00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:84%
But also, you stay on the
cutting edge of everything.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.830 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to lay
that out for people

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.940 align:middle line:90%
before we start talking.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.435 align:middle line:84%
You're not just another
health coach out there.

00:04:31.435 --> 00:04:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: You know, I
think my superpower is

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.520 align:middle line:84%
in thinking things through and
integrating them, and really

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.170 align:middle line:84%
not trying to project what
I think onto the person

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.910 align:middle line:84%
that I'm working with,
or even to myself,

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.850 align:middle line:84%
to really being able to step
away and say, OK how am I going

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.380 align:middle line:90%
to put this puzzle together?

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.490 align:middle line:90%
How's it all going to fit.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And not just taking account
physiology and biochemistry,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.325 align:middle line:84%
but going beyond into
things like human design

00:04:58.325 --> 00:04:59.125 align:middle line:90%
and astrology.

00:04:59.125 --> 00:04:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And some
maybe karmic things.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So trying to put as many
pieces on the table,

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and try to
understand, OK, how am

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.940 align:middle line:84%
I or my client that's
managing their life,

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.740 align:middle line:90%
how we're managing our energy.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Where can we spend more, where
can we take a little out?

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And how we can create a
better, more holistic approach

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.810 align:middle line:90%
to living?

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.227 align:middle line:84%
I always say there's two types
of clients that come to me.

00:05:22.227 --> 00:05:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Those that are ready
to completely shift

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.410 align:middle line:84%
their lifestyle and find
what actually works for them.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.020 align:middle line:90%
I also work a lot with genetics.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:84%
I love the field of
epigenetics and nutrigenomics.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And looking at that,
that also can help me

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.290 align:middle line:84%
understand where the person is
going to be in 10 years or 20

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.570 align:middle line:84%
if they continue
certain behaviors, what

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.090 align:middle line:84%
might be already expressed,
or what we can shift around.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very unique way to
be able to help people not

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.770 align:middle line:84%
to just feel better,
like in the short term,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.380 align:middle line:84%
but also set up some goals
for a longer period of time.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.033 align:middle line:84%
And I also say I have other
clients who are just not

00:05:57.033 --> 00:05:58.450 align:middle line:84%
ready to make the
lifestyle shift.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
desperate because they

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.655 align:middle line:90%
got the bad diagnosis.

00:06:00.655 --> 00:06:02.655 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Exactly, yeah,
preventing the wheels

00:06:02.655 --> 00:06:03.610 align:middle line:90%
from falling off.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, it's
also very high-powered type-A

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%

that just can't stop.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.060 align:middle line:90%
They just want to keep going.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's just what
they're doing in their life.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:17.920 align:middle line:90%
And I do the best they can.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.733 align:middle line:84%
But I always say you can't
supplement lifestyle.

00:06:20.733 --> 00:06:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you can't
supplement that lifestyle.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.483 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: You're going to go
this way, at least you're going

00:06:25.483 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:90%
to go into a fully conscious.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.140 align:middle line:84%
At least you know that
this is what you're going

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.400 align:middle line:90%
to end up dealing with it.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you get older,
you either lose your brain,

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.970 align:middle line:84%
you lose your immune system, or
you lose your mobility, right?

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes all three,
but usually, one of them

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.370 align:middle line:90%
will go first.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.282 align:middle line:84%
So we can start telling
what is going on, just

00:06:43.282 --> 00:06:45.115 align:middle line:84%
looking at genetics,
and lifestyle, and kind

00:06:45.115 --> 00:06:47.230 align:middle line:84%
of already
symptomology, and maybe

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.590 align:middle line:84%
human signs and astrology,
all those type of things,

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.770 align:middle line:84%
to figure out where are we going
to put the most energy to try

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:54.895 align:middle line:90%
to support which system.

00:06:54.895 --> 00:06:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and
that's what's beautiful,

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.720 align:middle line:84%
is taking every
person individually.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now let's dive
into the immune system

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:84%
and how it's affected by
emotions, particularly fear

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.670 align:middle line:90%
and anxiety.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.087 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to start looking--

00:07:08.087 --> 00:07:11.290 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole list here
of all of the biochemical,

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.750 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic, and
other types of processes

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.845 align:middle line:84%
are just pushed down like
dominoes once this happens.

00:07:18.845 --> 00:07:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So of course,
when we're fearful,

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.120 align:middle line:84%
when we have something that may
be a real threat or perceived

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:84%
threat, a cascade of
physiological symptoms

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:90%
are happening in the body.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Your heart rate goes up.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.940 align:middle line:90%
Your blood pressure goes up.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.830 align:middle line:84%
You get blood flow away from the
organs, and into extremities,

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.140 align:middle line:84%
because you're preparing
for either fight, flight,

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.310 align:middle line:90%
or freeze.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So you know that
you have to mobilize

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.710 align:middle line:84%
as much energy as possible
to sprint somewhere or run

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:44.510 align:middle line:90%
away somewhere.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that does
not happen anymore.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.490 align:middle line:90%
We do not run away-- from what?

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, of course--

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's debt
collectors now and such.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes, and the
other thing that happens

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.000 align:middle line:84%
is, in our normal
day-to-day life,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:90%
we have these brain engines.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And the brain can create a
situation in which the body

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.960 align:middle line:90%
can't tell from reality.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
co-worker that is maybe

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.350 align:middle line:84%
saying bad things about
you, and you're being upset

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and you know fearful about going
to work, this is your lion.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
This is somebody
that's chasing you,

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.390 align:middle line:84%
so you're constantly going
to be in that fight or flight

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.190 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.090 align:middle line:84%
You're constantly
going to be taking away

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:26.050 align:middle line:84%
blood flow from your organs
into your extremities.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
the brain usually

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.800 align:middle line:84%
after a fearful situation
like this will say, OK.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:90%
Everything is fine.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.470 align:middle line:90%
We can come down.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.450 align:middle line:84%
We can bring everything
back to normal.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:84%
But a normal day-to-day
normal lifestyle nowadays,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.520 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't happen.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.825 align:middle line:84%
We continuously happen
to stress ourselves out

00:08:43.825 --> 00:08:47.320 align:middle line:84%
with our thoughts, with our
projections into the future,

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.570 align:middle line:84%
with our thoughts
about the past,

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.190 align:middle line:84%
not living in the
present moment,

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and creating these subjective
fearful scenarios that the body

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.230 align:middle line:90%
perceives as real.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And when it's going constantly
into the stress mode,

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:84%
it never gets a rest
and relax response.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:08.680 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
flexibility going

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.880 align:middle line:84%
between the parasympathetic
to sympathetic and back.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.160 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, the body
goes like, OK, she's

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:13.960 align:middle line:90%
always in stress.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even going
to send any message.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.070 align:middle line:90%
We're just going to say--

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She's not
going to get it.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: This is constantly--
she's living in a lair

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:22.890 align:middle line:90%
of lions--

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.992 align:middle line:90%
--which is very draining.

00:09:25.992 --> 00:09:26.950 align:middle line:90%
Which is very draining.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The most common
thing I'm hearing now--

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and there are a lot of
aspects to it, as we know,

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:90%
is that people say I'm so tired.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And now we've just
gone through this--

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:41.170 align:middle line:84%
we're still in the midst of
this huge energetic reset, where

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.660 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people don't have
work, kids aren't in school.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And so everything
has just stopped.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.172 align:middle line:90%
There's this big pause.

00:09:47.172 --> 00:09:48.380 align:middle line:90%
There's been this huge pause.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah, the great
pause, however you call it.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The great pause, yes.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about it,
because even though on one

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.070 align:middle line:84%
level it was
wonderful for people

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:58.600 align:middle line:90%
to just be forced to stop.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.350 align:middle line:84%
On another, the fear and
anxiety that came in--

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Uncertainty.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes, uncertainty.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Isolation.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Isolation,
uncertainty.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:84%
What's happening can
be taken both ways.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you can take this as
time to connect with nature,

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:84%
to connect with your
children, to do some exercise,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.980 align:middle line:90%
to learn some new skills.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Or you could be
thinking about what's

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:90%
going to happen in wintertime.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen
if I step out of my house

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.040 align:middle line:90%
and go get groceries?

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.300 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of it is subjective
and objective realities.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And for people dealing with
this type of situation,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.320 align:middle line:90%
that's going to be--

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.020 align:middle line:84%
depending on how
much metabolism they

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.660 align:middle line:90%
have to make neurotransmitters.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.743 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's go
back to what I just said.

00:10:40.743 --> 00:10:42.190 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's saying, I'm tired.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.440 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's so tired.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Even when they're not
working, they're tired.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk
about the metabolism.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Something seems wrong.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Something
is wrong, and this

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:58.320 align:middle line:84%
is a very difficult question
to ask and to think about.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.277 align:middle line:84%
What if we are declining
metabolically as species?

00:11:02.277 --> 00:11:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that
wouldn't be good.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: That's not good.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.180 align:middle line:84%
First of all, talk about
the extended implications

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:84%
of just that statement before
we go into the why and how

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.500 align:middle line:90%
to fix it, and all that.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Well,
metabolism, you

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.410 align:middle line:90%
have to have energy to do work.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.400 align:middle line:90%
You have energy to make enzymes.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.100 align:middle line:84%
You have to have energy
to make neurotransmitters.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.570 align:middle line:90%
Everything requires energy.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.840 align:middle line:84%
We are an open thermodynamic
system, basically.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:84%
We create energy
and it dissipates.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So how much energy
you're going to make

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.820 align:middle line:84%
is going to depend a lot on
your mitochondrial health.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
other factors, too,

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.680 align:middle line:90%
of how much stress you're under.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.570 align:middle line:84%
So, if your mitochondria
is getting sicker--

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure you've had many
people on your show, especially

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:46.980 align:middle line:90%
Jack.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, Jack Kruse.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:49.567 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: You've
had several shows--

00:11:49.567 --> 00:11:49.805 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lot about it, yeah.

00:11:49.805 --> 00:11:50.763 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: --with him.

00:11:50.763 --> 00:11:53.315 align:middle line:84%
He is incredible at explaining
mitochondrial function.

00:11:53.315 --> 00:11:54.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
another genius.

00:11:54.815 --> 00:11:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Absolutely, yes.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So he explains this
very eloquently,

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.980 align:middle line:84%
of what happens to
mitochondria when it gets sick.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.520 align:middle line:84%
It becomes less efficient
at producing energy.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't
have enough energy,

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.890 align:middle line:84%
the body is going to go like,
OK, it's all about survival.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Which functions do I
need to keep going,

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.080 align:middle line:84%
and which functions can I just
chuck to continue surviving?

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So like a person in a
coma, their heart rate

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.700 align:middle line:90%
is moving still.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.230 align:middle line:90%
There are certain processes.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Blood pressure is keeping up,
but there is no consciousness.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Because cognitive processes,
especially senses and emotions,

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.800 align:middle line:84%
are very expensive
metabolically.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.510 align:middle line:84%
They actually require
a lot of energy.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.622 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, emotions,
we can see that.

00:12:38.622 --> 00:12:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY:
Absolutely, so you have

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:84%
to make enough energy to be
able to make neurotransmitters.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Everything requires
that injection of energy

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.140 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
produce new proteins,

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.710 align:middle line:84%
to be able to produce
new tissues and cells

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.020 align:middle line:90%
and neurotransmitters.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't
have enough of that,

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.560 align:middle line:84%
do you think your body
is going to spend it

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.910 align:middle line:90%
on your better state of mind?

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:03.313 --> 00:13:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah, or
is it going to try

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:10.020 align:middle line:84%
to tell us go for a run,
when it's trying to repair

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
major problems in the

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.640 align:middle line:90%
to keep the inflammation down.

>>REGINA: And what overall
observation has made you

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.960 align:middle line:84%
question whether or not we

in metabolic decline.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes, well a
combination of things.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:33.270 align:middle line:84%
First of all, just looking
at how much immune disorder

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.070 align:middle line:90%
we have--

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.010 align:middle line:90%

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:40.910 align:middle line:90%
which you just explained.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.937 align:middle line:84%
How many women get blown
out so much earlier and--

00:13:43.937 --> 00:13:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Younger in life.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Younger in
life and just feeling

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.110 align:middle line:84%
completely exhausted before
your perimenopause starts.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Also, talking to practitioners,
a lot of the chiropractors,

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.830 align:middle line:84%
a lot of body manipulating
types of practitioners

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.630 align:middle line:84%
will tell you that
20 years ago, you

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:05.497 align:middle line:84%
could come in for an adjustment
and hold it for a month.

00:14:05.497 --> 00:14:06.830 align:middle line:90%
You won't have to see somebody--

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your muscles
basically would pull it back

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.130 align:middle line:90%

>>VOLYNSKY: So it's like
there was integrity.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:13.340 align:middle line:90%
There was stability.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, I mean, you could
be in a chiropractic office

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:17.330 align:middle line:90%
every couple of days.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Because
there is no stability.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.970 align:middle line:84%
There is no more ability to
manage some of these processes.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think the other aspect
is we have such increased

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.650 align:middle line:90%
rates of inflammation--

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes, in our bodies.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is a
community process of toxins

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.560 align:middle line:84%
in the environment,
depletion of the soil,

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.300 align:middle line:90%
not having the right nutrients.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Of course, having all the
plastics and water pollution,

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.040 align:middle line:90%
air pollution, the EMFs.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all of that is stressing
the physiology and all of that

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.080 align:middle line:90%
is costing us metabolism.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, I
think the factor that

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.330 align:middle line:84%
is really hard to track,
because nobody is looking

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.120 align:middle line:84%
at astrophysics and
biology in the same place,

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.900 align:middle line:84%
is we have had major changes
into our astrophysical

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.080 align:middle line:84%
situations, so all the magnetic
field of the Earth to where--

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And Ben Davidson
from spaceweather.com

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.898 align:middle line:84%
has been tracking this
for quite a while.

00:15:16.898 --> 00:15:18.065 align:middle line:90%
There's tons of information.

00:15:18.065 --> 00:15:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Spaceweather.com.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY:
Spaceweather.com, and there's

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.090 align:middle line:84%
lots of information
showing that we

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.250 align:middle line:84%
are in a different
electromagnetic environment

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.360 align:middle line:90%
than we have been.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.740 align:middle line:90%
Our poles are shifting.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:31.040 align:middle line:84%
When the poles are shifting,
the magnetic field is shifting.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to
the NASA website,

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and if you watch
that type of thing,

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.650 align:middle line:84%
you will see the
days where there's

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.750 align:middle line:84%
giant holes in the magnetic
field of the Earth.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And they are worried about
satellites being damaged.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.408 align:middle line:84%
We're not thinking about human
bodies being affected by this.

00:15:44.408 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Our brain has to
have a stable magnetic field

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:90%
to function.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Absolutely.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And people
are going nuts.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes, yes,
and it's a known fact,

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.380 align:middle line:84%
when there is a solar
flare, that people end up

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:55.420 align:middle line:90%
in mental hospitals.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.420 align:middle line:90%
There is more accidents.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.130 align:middle line:84%
There's been studies
on that done.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when
we have, actually,

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.290 align:middle line:84%
less solar activity, when
we have low solar activity

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and no solar wind, which
solar activity creates,

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:84%
like, a bubble for us and
protection from cosmic rays.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.780 align:middle line:90%
So we don't have that.

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.880 align:middle line:84%
We have more cosmic
rays coming towards us.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When there's
low solar activity.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And
that's radiation.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: That's
radiation, and we

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.470 align:middle line:84%
don't know how our bodies
will deal with that.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.190 align:middle line:84%
There actually has been
recently a study in July 2020.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:26.840 align:middle line:84%
It's published in
"The American Journal

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:90%
of Experimental Medicine."

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was looking at
healthy male subjects.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I think it was 64 of them, and
they were also subjecting them

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.637 align:middle line:84%
to geomagnetic stress
under normal conditions

00:16:38.637 --> 00:16:39.845 align:middle line:90%
and in controlled conditions.

00:16:39.845 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Geomagnetic stress?

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.672 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah,
geomagnetic stress.

00:16:42.672 --> 00:16:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And they have shown there
was quite a bit of effect

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.390 align:middle line:84%
on the autonomic nervous
system, your ability

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.300 align:middle line:84%
to regulate parasympathetic
and sympathetic stress.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And when-- there where we
had high geomagnetic fields

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and geomagnetic radiation,
whenever they had it,

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.940 align:middle line:84%
there was way more
dysregulation.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:84%
They were tracking
heart rate variability.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.670 align:middle line:84%
They were checking
blood pressure.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:03.920 align:middle line:90%
So they were actually surging.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.337 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
all dysregulated.

00:17:05.337 --> 00:17:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah, it
was very dysregulated.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.319 align:middle line:84%
And how it's going to
translate to each person

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.270 align:middle line:90%
will depend on other factors.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.760 align:middle line:84%
If they're already
dysregulated from just

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.740 align:middle line:84%
living hard, or having mold,
or having heavy metal toxicity,

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.740 align:middle line:84%
or losing their hormones
because they're getting older,

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.650 align:middle line:84%
that could affect
them so much more.

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And radiation is
very interesting.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, tell
me that, because I

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:30.805 align:middle line:84%
want to get back into it,
the radiation and the sun.

00:17:30.805 --> 00:17:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, come in
a different door.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Finish this part,
and then I'm going

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:33.800 align:middle line:90%
to come in a different door.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Well, what
I was going to say is--

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.273 align:middle line:84%
again, a lot of people say,
well, I don't feel anything.

00:17:38.273 --> 00:17:39.685 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is happening to me.

00:17:39.685 --> 00:17:41.060 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
interesting moment,

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.625 align:middle line:84%
for me I read Madame
Curie's biography.

00:17:44.625 --> 00:17:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: There's a
movie about her, too.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:48.308 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, there is?

00:17:48.308 --> 00:17:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah,
on Prime Video.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.885 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's it called?

00:17:50.885 --> 00:17:51.635 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: "Radioactive."

00:17:51.635 --> 00:17:52.535 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Radioactive."

00:17:52.535 --> 00:17:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.363 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And Madam Marie Curie.

00:17:54.363 --> 00:17:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes, and I
actually watched that.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.970 align:middle line:84%
A person goes like, how
on Earth did I never

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:84%
read her autobiography,
because I'm

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.270 align:middle line:90%
so interested in the subject.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you read
her autobiography,

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.130 align:middle line:84%
these people were playing
with radioactive stones.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:11.510 align:middle line:90%
They were carrying them around.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.820 align:middle line:84%
They were messing around with
them without any protection.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like people used
to play with mercury balls.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Absolutely,
and it was wild,

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle line:90%
because some people got sick.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:20.580 align:middle line:90%
Some people didn't.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Some people died.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.610 align:middle line:90%
So people didn't.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So you just don't
know how much of that

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.600 align:middle line:84%
stress will either maybe create
a hermetic state, a state where

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.630 align:middle line:84%
you can maybe evolve and
get better and adapt better,

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:36.290 align:middle line:90%
or it can really create damage--

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:37.250 align:middle line:90%
DNA damage.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now there
are three different things

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.320 align:middle line:90%
I want to talk to you about.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Did you and I ever talk
about that woman Elena

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Tonetti-Vladimirova?

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes, we have.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.090 align:middle line:90%
We have on our last interview.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I thought we did,
because I already knew you

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.140 align:middle line:90%
then--

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.640 align:middle line:84%
I had just interviewed her,
I think, back then, maybe

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.050 align:middle line:90%
a year or two before.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.600 align:middle line:84%
That was interesting, because
that was the same phenomena

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.680 align:middle line:90%
they noticed.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.300 align:middle line:84%
When people were
exposed, they had

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.580 align:middle line:84%
either a hyper-reaction
where their bodies handled

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.760 align:middle line:84%
it extraordinarily well, or
a very bad reaction where

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.610 align:middle line:84%
you were having birth defects
in the blood lines and so forth.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:08.630 align:middle line:90%
And so what are--

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:11.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know you
can't answer this.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.580 align:middle line:84%
But if you could just
give a generalized

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.920 align:middle line:84%
answer, why would
some people's bodies

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.050 align:middle line:84%
be able to embrace
and use radiation,

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:19.670 align:middle line:84%
while another is
destroyed by it?

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: It's a good question
to ask, because honestly,

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.160 align:middle line:84%
to be able to answer that,
you should be tracking

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.370 align:middle line:84%
a variety of
factors, if you want,

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.130 align:middle line:90%
from the scientific method.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:33.530 align:middle line:84%
You need to look at the
mitochondrial potential

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
look at genetics.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah, you have
to look at the tissue, health

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.463 align:middle line:84%
of the tissue, because we can
take blood from you right now

00:19:43.463 --> 00:19:44.630 align:middle line:90%
and see what's in the blood.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.210 align:middle line:84%
But to actually know what's
going on at the tissue level,

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:48.710 align:middle line:90%
we have to cut into it.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.270 align:middle line:84%
We have to go into
the liver to know

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.345 align:middle line:90%
where it's infected with x.

00:19:52.345 --> 00:19:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you
just have evidence

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.440 align:middle line:90%
of things in the blood.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very complex,
I think, question.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.377 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have a
specific answer why.

00:20:01.377 --> 00:20:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I bring
it up, because we're

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.450 align:middle line:84%
in the same situation at
this moment in history,

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.910 align:middle line:84%
where everybody's bodies
are reacting differently

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.007 align:middle line:84%
to a virus that's been around
the planet for a while now,

00:20:11.007 --> 00:20:11.840 align:middle line:90%
and continues to be.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.382 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: It says
by individuality.

00:20:13.382 --> 00:20:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I think it does come
down to mitochondria,

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.980 align:middle line:84%
and the strength of your
mitochondria and the ability

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.360 align:middle line:84%
to have energy to deal with
something is a huge factor.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So mitochondria,
that that's where we really

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:27.380 align:middle line:90%
start the journey.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: I would say so.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the sun again.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.253 align:middle line:84%
Now, we were going to
go back into radiation

00:20:31.253 --> 00:20:32.300 align:middle line:90%
just a little bit.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.620 align:middle line:84%
You and I both have
this thing in common

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.430 align:middle line:84%
we talked about starting
two or three years ago,

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.350 align:middle line:84%
where it was painful
to be in the sun

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.240 align:middle line:90%
after early morning hours.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.930 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it hurts.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about why that might be.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's cut to Jack
Kruse, who we both admire.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Jack
Kruse, the first thing

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:84%
he's going to tell you,
get out in the sun.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:90%
Get into the sun.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.230 align:middle line:84%
What is the difference
between going out into the sun

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:01.310 align:middle line:84%
and taking in all the sun's
information, versus suffering

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:04.640 align:middle line:84%
from the radiation, or
the cosmic radiation,

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.950 align:middle line:84%
because of, say, lack
of solar protection

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.083 align:middle line:90%
or excessive solar protection?

00:21:09.083 --> 00:21:10.250 align:middle line:90%
Explain the nuance in there.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Well, I think
we do need our sun's energy.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.175 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:21:15.175 --> 00:21:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's loaded with
information of every kind that

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:18.592 align:middle line:90%
gives life to everything.

00:21:18.592 --> 00:21:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: It's safe.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's
safer to go early

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.730 align:middle line:90%
in the morning and afternoon.

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is the type of rays
you want in your body anyway.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the type of information
you want to go into your brain.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Early morning sun,
sunrise, sunset,

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.380 align:middle line:90%
that's really where it's at.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.200 align:middle line:84%
As far as how much
radiation a body

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.735 align:middle line:84%
will be able to handle
after hours, I think again,

00:21:38.735 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:90%
it will depend on genetics.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.780 align:middle line:90%
It will depend on inflammation.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.080 align:middle line:90%
It will depend on the diet.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:90%
It will depend on your karma.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:47.995 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:47.995 --> 00:21:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is
so many factors.

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:49.880 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's by individual.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we have to
clean up the whole thing.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it's
short exposures.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, if you have--

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What exposure?

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Short exposures to
the sun and in the safe hours.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I would say when we do have
very intense solar activity,

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I end up not going out
as much just personally.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.627 align:middle line:90%
And I can actually feel it.

00:22:09.627 --> 00:22:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Even inside of the
house, it was like,

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:12.440 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't feel good to go out.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Like, I'll
go out for sunrise.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.380 align:middle line:90%
I'll look at the sun.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.350 align:middle line:84%
I'll get the energy,
and back inside.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:19.670 align:middle line:90%
And I feel better inside.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And that's
part of intuitive knowing

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.280 align:middle line:90%
of when to just go and hide.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.343 align:middle line:84%
When to just stay in and
not get exposed to it.

00:22:27.343 --> 00:22:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
point is, this is

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.980 align:middle line:84%
a major factor on this
planet, not just with us,

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.120 align:middle line:84%
but all animals and all
life forms at this time.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And the
other thing is, like, we

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:36.350 align:middle line:90%
can't control radiation.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.450 align:middle line:84%
We can't control
cosmic radiation.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:39.890 align:middle line:90%
We can't control the sun.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:42.800 align:middle line:90%
I say we do the best we can.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.200 align:middle line:84%
We do the best we can with
the information we have.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.160 align:middle line:84%
We rely on our senses, on our
intuition, on the knowledge

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.090 align:middle line:90%
we have.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.550 align:middle line:90%
And again, it might go one way.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:53.570 align:middle line:90%
It might go another way.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:57.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we just do the best we
can without overly obsessing.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree
with that, yes.

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:00.440 align:middle line:84%
The sun hurts,
don't go out in it.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Exactly.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we look at
other forms of radiation.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:84%
We do have the ability,
to an extent-- though it's

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.800 align:middle line:84%
becoming increasingly
more difficult to deflect,

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.720 align:middle line:84%
exposure to other kinds
of man-made radiation.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Oh yes.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, this is
also I assume a big problem

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:17.315 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to metabolism
and mitochondria.

00:23:17.315 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, most definitely part
of the conversation of what's

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.060 align:middle line:90%
happening there.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Man-made, we're not meant
to have these signals coming

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.150 align:middle line:90%
through the body.

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:84%
The body is a communication
being in a sense,

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.850 align:middle line:90%
and it's electrical.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:33.260 align:middle line:90%
It communicates.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And those type of
waves can definitely

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.350 align:middle line:84%
disrupt communication
within the cell.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.620 align:middle line:84%
It can definitely affect
mitochondrial health.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:42.320 align:middle line:90%
It has been shown already.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it's becoming
more and more mainstream.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.660 align:middle line:84%
I think the radiation from
the sun and cosmic rays

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.610 align:middle line:90%
are so much more powerful.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was the
formative forces.

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And it has more
potential and power

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.620 align:middle line:84%
to shift the whole
race or all the species

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.360 align:middle line:90%
into positive or negative.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about
adaptability at the end.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.340 align:middle line:84%
When people say
survival of the fittest,

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.930 align:middle line:84%
it's actually Darwin saying
survival of the most adaptable.

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's all about adaptation,
whether our systems are going

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:16.820 align:middle line:84%
to get adapted to either
new cosmic radiation,

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.713 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it's not
going to adapt.

00:24:18.713 --> 00:24:20.630 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it's
going to be comfortable.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.890 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it's
going to be uncomfortable.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:84%
The point being
it's there, and I

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.450 align:middle line:84%
think it's a huge
contributing factor

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:29.850 align:middle line:90%
to our physiological decline.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:31.015 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just man-made.

00:24:31.015 --> 00:24:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we definitely
made a mess

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:33.930 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of different things.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
electromagnetics is

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.970 align:middle line:84%
going to be like
cigarettes of the future.

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I think so too.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: We're
going to be going back,

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and goes like, what the
heck were we thinking?

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:46.190 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely something
very new to us as species,

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and we haven't had the
time to adapt to this.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.820 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
maybe in 2000 years.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.680 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take
that long for us to get

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.680 align:middle line:84%
adapted to this type of
new information sources

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.200 align:middle line:84%
coming into our
body and signals.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we'll find some kind
of technological solutions.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, there's lots of
people working towards it.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.380 align:middle line:90%
There's lots of German and--

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't actually see as
many American devices.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:17.480 align:middle line:84%
A lot of this is coming from
Germany and Switzerland,

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Russia, where are we trying
to mitigate the field

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.840 align:middle line:84%
or cancel out the wave, or
shift something in a field

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.918 align:middle line:90%
so it's not as damaging.

00:25:25.918 --> 00:25:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think we'll see
more and more of that.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping to see
more actual data on it,

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.290 align:middle line:84%
because there hasn't been really
good, well-designed studies

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:34.100 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.120 align:middle line:84%
But I'm pretty sure
we'll see more of that.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.100 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely on
everybody's mind.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And we are learning at
least how to manage it.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Like, turn off your
Wi-Fi at night.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:44.530 align:middle line:90%
Simple.

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Check your
house for dirty electricity.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.900 align:middle line:84%
There's an Institute of
Biological Engineering that

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.450 align:middle line:84%
will send a person to you to
come and check your house,

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.268 align:middle line:84%
whether you have bad
wiring and bad fields,

00:25:55.268 --> 00:25:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and it's contributing
to your health.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Institute of
Biological Engineering?

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah, yes,
and that they train,

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.710 align:middle line:84%
basically, techs
to come and measure

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.890 align:middle line:84%
your magnetic
field, your MF, URF,

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.540 align:middle line:84%
and then find solutions of
how to optimize your house.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:13.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you have your own house,
I think it's a really good idea

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.190 align:middle line:90%
to go out of your way.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And instead of
buying a new kitchen

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.060 align:middle line:84%
and putting in new
sinks, really optimizes--

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Make sure your
house has clean energy.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Buy a house.

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:23.840 align:middle line:90%
Buy a house.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.770 align:middle line:90%
Optimize your air.

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Optimize your
electromagnetics in the house.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And some of it can
also be esoteric.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.620 align:middle line:90%
I have had my house.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.200 align:middle line:84%
I worked on wiring
and things like this.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And also, sometimes, the
energy is just wrong.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.360 align:middle line:84%
There's things like
crystal grids and--

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Geopathic stress.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Geopathic stress,
where in my new house,

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.180 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't be for
the first few days

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.840 align:middle line:84%
more than two or three hours
at a time, which just burned me

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:51.200 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.658 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, on
the top of hill,

00:26:52.658 --> 00:26:55.010 align:middle line:84%
there's lots of ley lines,
lots of energy going on.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, Sedona.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:27:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And it took me a
while to, like, OK, what is it?

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.990 align:middle line:84%
I was like I come
crawling out of my skin.

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And I already did all
the other remediations,

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.852 align:middle line:90%
and I know it wasn't mold.

00:27:06.852 --> 00:27:08.060 align:middle line:90%
That's the other aspect, too.

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.160 align:middle line:84%
You want to make sure you live
in a mold-free environment,

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.860 align:middle line:90%
especially during this time.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.990 align:middle line:84%
You don't want another
respiratory stress.

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And mold is notorious,
and mold inspecting

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.120 align:middle line:84%
is notorious for being wrong,
too, because it's a huge deal

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.110 align:middle line:84%
to be able to actually find it
and identify it and get rid of.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, it hides
out in little dark places you

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:28.788 align:middle line:90%
can't-- they can't see.

00:27:28.788 --> 00:27:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah, between
the walls or the ceiling.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a big factor.

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think it nips a lot at our
lowered immune systems already.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.610 align:middle line:84%
So back to my house, we
had to actually create

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:45.057 align:middle line:84%
these little mini-vortexes
with pyramids and other things.

00:27:45.057 --> 00:27:47.390 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend who is really
good at this type of stuff.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.592 align:middle line:84%
He came and tested my house
out and dug some holes

00:27:50.592 --> 00:27:51.800 align:middle line:90%
and moved some things around.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:53.870 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.945 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it is completely placebo.

00:27:56.945 --> 00:27:58.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
are really sensitive.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: But it was, like,
feeling pretty good after that.

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And the field also
shift time to time.

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:08.080 align:middle line:84%
So time to time, he
has to come over and--

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is
a very complex matter.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: It is.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And all of us are
sitting in a soup of it.

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Each one is different.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Each house is different.

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:16.280 align:middle line:90%
The land run is different.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And then you start going
back to what we originally

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.580 align:middle line:90%
were talking about.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Start adding in the
cocktail of our emotions

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.405 align:middle line:84%
and such, and how we
interface with it that way.

00:28:24.405 --> 00:28:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And you were talking
about flexibility,

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.910 align:middle line:84%
and Darwin saying those
who are the most adaptable,

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:31.490 align:middle line:84%
this is very much going to
be the story of our future

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:32.750 align:middle line:90%
as a species right now.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: We are
really trying to adapt.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.478 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, we are
not only trying to adapt.

00:28:36.478 --> 00:28:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But that need to be mentally
and emotionally flexible

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:44.268 align:middle line:84%
now during a time that
is a great human shift.

00:28:44.268 --> 00:28:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Great human
shift, I would definitely

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:47.110 align:middle line:90%
agree with that.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And without that
flexibility emotionally,

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:53.780 align:middle line:84%
to be able to flow a little
bit, take a step back.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Like you say, take a nap.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of
all, let's just say

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.600 align:middle line:84%
that some people are not going
to be able to take a step back.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:28:59.855 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:59.855 --> 00:29:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Going
back to metabolism,

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.160 align:middle line:84%
and neurotransmitters
being extremely

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.452 align:middle line:84%
expensive for the body to make
metabolically speaking-wise,

00:29:08.452 --> 00:29:10.160 align:middle line:84%
if you're already low,
and if you already

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.610 align:middle line:84%
had mold exposure, anybody
who has Lyme's, mold

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:16.790 align:middle line:84%
exposure and mold toxic,
they will tell you,

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:19.310 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, they just can't get
themselves out of depression.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: They literally
do not have energy to do so.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Like, every sense
is very metabolically expensive.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.400 align:middle line:84%
So in those types of
cases, it definitely

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.012 align:middle line:84%
would be hard to just, like,
oh I'm just going to step away.

00:29:34.012 --> 00:29:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not possible.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Like,
it's not possible.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.800 align:middle line:84%
You have to find a way
to stabilize yourself

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.060 align:middle line:90%
metabolically.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.670 align:middle line:10%
And for a lot of
this type of clients,

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.100 align:middle line:10%
instead of doing more
cleanses, instead of

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.990 align:middle line:10%
doing a more detoxes
and more kill-offs,

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:50.780 align:middle line:10%
we go like, OK what
can we subtract?

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:55.820 align:middle line:10%
Where can we create more
energy in the system?

00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:00.290 align:middle line:84%
When can you just shut
your eyes, close them?

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Like, one of the best ways
to stop a nervous system that

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:09.140 align:middle line:84%
is completely wild and crazy
is just stop the input.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Put a blindfold on, put
earplugs in, and lay down.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And just chill,
and just no input,

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.270 align:middle line:90%
no nervous system stimulation.

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Let everything just calm down.

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.475 align:middle line:84%
And this actually comes from
dealing with autistic children.

00:30:22.475 --> 00:30:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Autistic, yeah.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah, and this is
talking about adaptability.

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:31.910 align:middle line:84%
This is basically, to
me, a newer generation

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:35.920 align:middle line:84%
that has less metabolism
for their brain function.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And they're already born
with either infections

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.760 align:middle line:84%
or heavy metals, or something
that is nipping on the ability

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.180 align:middle line:84%
to develop a full
nervous system that

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.467 align:middle line:84%
is capable of more emotions,
that is capable of handling--

00:30:51.467 --> 00:30:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All the sensory input.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Sensory input.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And shutting down the input
by having the blindfold on

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and earplugs, it actually
comes from that research,

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:03.840 align:middle line:84%
and calming children
down with autism

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.458 align:middle line:84%
when they have an
episode to help

00:31:05.458 --> 00:31:06.750 align:middle line:90%
them get back into stabilizing.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But the same for--

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.000 align:middle line:84%
helping to put the
autonomic nervous system

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000 align:middle line:90%
in some kind of balance.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Some kind
of balance at least.

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:17.730 align:middle line:84%
No input, less agitation, so the
system can at least calm down.

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of
the ways, obviously,

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:23.460 align:middle line:84%
to do that if you don't
have absolutely any energy

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.560 align:middle line:90%
to deal with anything else.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Taking more rest, sleeping,
not beating yourself up

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:33.150 align:middle line:84%
for not being able
to produce somebody

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.160 align:middle line:90%
on a high-level function.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Not beating yourself up
for watching Netflix,

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.410 align:middle line:84%
even though it's not great, but
when your brain can't process,

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:43.170 align:middle line:84%
when it doesn't have
the energy to think--

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.753 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't try pressing it.

00:31:44.753 --> 00:31:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Don't
try pressing it.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Just relax, and sometimes,
just having something mindless

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:51.350 align:middle line:90%
can be very therapeutic.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, for me,
as just one example--

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.350 align:middle line:90%
and I think it's pretty common.

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of wattage
especially in the morning.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.720 align:middle line:84%
I can do a lot,
and collapse a lot

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.670 align:middle line:84%
into a short amount
of time, and go.

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And then for me
always, by the time

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.260 align:middle line:84%
late afternoon hits and
the sun starts going down,

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.100 align:middle line:84%
that's when my brain activity
starts lowering, too.

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:11.993 align:middle line:84%
As soon as the light
starts going away.

00:32:11.993 --> 00:32:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And so for me,
watching something,

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:16.800 align:middle line:84%
like binging on some sweet
little series is perfect.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.170 align:middle line:84%
I feel totally at rest,
go to sleep peacefully,

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:20.755 align:middle line:84%
and wake up with
high wattage again.

00:32:20.755 --> 00:32:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Hopefully, you're
wearing your orange glasses

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:23.790 align:middle line:90%
while you're doing it.

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:24.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Since I interviewed
Jack, I have been meaning--

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.120 align:middle line:90%
darn it.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.703 align:middle line:84%
I've been meaning
to get on that site.

00:32:29.703 --> 00:32:31.800 align:middle line:84%
I think even put the
contact information on there

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.257 align:middle line:90%
to get the orange glasses.

00:32:33.257 --> 00:32:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's a really good idea.

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.090 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm not wearing
orange glasses,

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:37.330 align:middle line:90%
but I fall asleep anyway.

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Still, you can go ahead and
reiterate this to our audience,

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.060 align:middle line:90%
now we've brought that.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes,
blue light pollution

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:47.370 align:middle line:84%
is one of the
man-made things that

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:49.050 align:middle line:84%
have been creating
a lot of havoc

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.105 align:middle line:84%
in our hormonal system
and our cortisol.

00:32:51.105 --> 00:32:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does it matter if it's
a television far away from you.

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Doesn't matter.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:55.560 align:middle line:90%
It's exposure to the light.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The light itself.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:57.195 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: It's the
light frequencies.

00:32:57.195 --> 00:32:58.903 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
just close-up devices.

00:32:58.903 --> 00:33:01.278 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: What happens when
you're watching and looking

00:33:01.278 --> 00:33:03.180 align:middle line:84%
at these devices at
night, it basically tells

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:03.980 align:middle line:90%
you it's daytime.

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.392 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: That's what your
brain thinks is happening.

00:33:07.392 --> 00:33:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And so you don't
have a proper cascade

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:11.890 align:middle line:84%
of having hormones to
calm down to sleep, rest,

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:15.270 align:middle line:84%
and digest, and have a
restful night of sleep

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:16.670 align:middle line:90%
where your body will regenerate.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And of course in the
morning, you wake up,

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and things are just going
to be sideways from there.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:21.790 align:middle line:90%
And it affects everything.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:24.232 align:middle line:84%
So I think managing
your blue light exposure

00:33:24.232 --> 00:33:25.440 align:middle line:90%
is actually really important.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is what
Jack really goes on about.

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: He is, and I
did learn that from him.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.215 align:middle line:84%
And I would say it
made a huge difference.

00:33:31.215 --> 00:33:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you use
the orange glasses.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.597 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: I actually
have, like, three types

00:33:34.597 --> 00:33:35.550 align:middle line:90%
of different glasses.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:38.250 align:middle line:84%
For daytime, for using computer
work-- a little bit lighter

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:40.170 align:middle line:84%
in color, that
helped me with glare.

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And just my eyes
are feeling better.

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Then closer to the evening,
like after sundown,

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:52.500 align:middle line:84%
but maybe not ready for
bed, I wear the orange ones.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And then literally, an
hour and a half before bed,

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:56.713 align:middle line:84%
I wear the red ones-- the
really, really red ones,

00:33:56.713 --> 00:33:58.805 align:middle line:84%
where you can't see
anything basically.

00:33:58.805 --> 00:34:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where
do you get these?

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:01.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, just go to bed.

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah, but
sometimes the lights are on,

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.750 align:middle line:84%
and I know I'm going
to go to bed at 9:00,

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:09.639 align:middle line:84%
but the lights are
on, this is going on,

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:13.620 align:middle line:84%
and I want as much information
going into my body saying it's

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:14.969 align:middle line:90%
going to be bedtime.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.739 align:middle line:90%
We need to lessen--

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:19.469 align:middle line:90%
relax, you need to wind down.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:21.772 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK, so
for you it's a ramp-down.

00:34:21.772 --> 00:34:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And I do find that
the red glasses really help.

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I will get a pair.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
other people watching

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:28.148 align:middle line:90%
will be doing the same.

00:34:28.148 --> 00:34:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So getting back to
the original point,

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:32.860 align:middle line:84%
this is allowing us to go
into a normal sleep cycle

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.270 align:middle line:84%
at night, because
a lot of people

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:35.927 align:middle line:90%
are having trouble sleeping.

00:34:35.927 --> 00:34:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is because they're
not getting out, not doing

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.802 align:middle line:84%
what they normally
do during the day,

00:34:39.802 --> 00:34:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and feel like they're
not moving and burning

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:45.850 align:middle line:84%
that internal energy the same
as they used to muscularly.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.429 align:middle line:84%
So many people are
just shut indoors now,

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:49.762 align:middle line:90%
and then restless at night.

00:34:49.762 --> 00:34:51.429 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Well,
some people don't even

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:52.800 align:middle line:90%
have the energy to move.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some people don't
have the energy to move at all.

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:57.008 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: A lot of the sleep
issues come down to cortisol

00:34:57.008 --> 00:34:58.120 align:middle line:90%
and to your hormones.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.570 align:middle line:84%
For women especially, we
are notorious for dropping

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:06.940 align:middle line:84%
progesterone, which is our rest
and relax anti-anxiety calm

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.623 align:middle line:84%
hormone that usually comes in
the second part of the cycle.

00:35:10.623 --> 00:35:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
when women are

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.510 align:middle line:84%
going through the
hormonal change,

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:15.830 align:middle line:84%
they just don't have
enough enough of it

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.100 align:middle line:84%
made anymore, so
you can't sleep.

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.830 align:middle line:84%
For men a lot of times,
it's the cortisol.

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:23.035 align:middle line:84%
And that is just
being high and dry,

00:35:23.035 --> 00:35:25.610 align:middle line:84%
with just running it out
and trying to do that.

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:28.220 align:middle line:90%
And the other thing is insulin.

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.568 align:middle line:84%
That's another
metabolic huge factor.

00:35:30.568 --> 00:35:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's
talk about this part.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah let's talk about this.

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So I've heard--
what was the statistic?

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:42.620 align:middle line:84%
88% of Americans are
not metabolically fit.

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:45.530 align:middle line:90%
So this was done in a study.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:49.468 align:middle line:84%
And Benjamin Bikman, who just
wrote a book "Why We Get Sick,"

00:35:49.468 --> 00:35:50.510 align:middle line:90%
which is an amazing book.

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:52.860 align:middle line:84%
I recommend anybody
reading that.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And he is a PhD who studies
insulin and cortisol.

00:35:57.170 --> 00:36:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And mostly insulin and
glucose, and leukemogenesis.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.150 align:middle line:90%
So he goes deep into this.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:06.320 align:middle line:90%
But he was mentioning it.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.200 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time I
heard that about that study.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.770 align:middle line:84%
There's 88% of people that
are not metabolically fit.

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So they were looking
at the waist.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So circumference, like
how big your waist

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:23.512 align:middle line:84%
is, HDL, LDL, triglycerides,
and insulin levels.

00:36:23.512 --> 00:36:25.720 align:middle line:84%
I think those are the ones
that they were looking at.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.123 align:middle line:84%
So if one of those
factors were out,

00:36:28.123 --> 00:36:29.790 align:middle line:84%
that meant you're not
metabolically fit,

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:32.510 align:middle line:84%
because it will have a cascade
of effects on everything else,

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:33.900 align:middle line:90%
or in blood pressure.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.430 align:middle line:84%
So that means there's only
12% people walking around who

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:38.690 align:middle line:90%
are metabolically fit.

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell, even I'm
not metabolically fit,

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:43.160 align:middle line:90%
because I have high LDL.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And I do a lot of
work everywhere else.

have to do a lot of work.

And I'm right now wearing a
glucose monitor on my arm--

00:37:15.455 --> 00:37:17.660 align:middle line:84%
a CGM, continuous
glucose monitor,

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.935 align:middle line:84%
that helps me track my glucose
at night, in the morning,

00:37:20.935 --> 00:37:26.060 align:middle line:84%
at daytime 14 days,
24 hours a day.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:27.560 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
prick your finger.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.330 align:middle line:84%
You have a nice little
device where you swipe,

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:30.747 align:middle line:84%
and it shows you
where you are at.

00:37:30.747 --> 00:37:32.490 align:middle line:84%
It shows you where
you are at night.

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So why do we need to
know this information?

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:39.560 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's a really
good tool for cell feedback.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going back to the
Nutrisense company.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:42.720 align:middle line:90%
They do direct to consumer.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
program that comes

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.060 align:middle line:84%
with it, where you can enter
your food and take a picture.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.880 align:middle line:84%
It also connects
to your ketones.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, it will be connected
to heart rate variability.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:56.720 align:middle line:84%
So you can understand more
about why your glucose

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.430 align:middle line:90%
is going up or down.

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:01.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a
food-related situation.

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:03.770 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, you
could have over-exercise,

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and your glucose went up,
because your glycogen stores

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:09.260 align:middle line:84%
are getting emptied back
into the bloodstream

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.580 align:middle line:90%
to feed the muscles.

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Or it's a cortisol issue or
it's an inflammation thing.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's a multifactorial
situation.

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:20.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really excited
about this specific device.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Not device, but
specific combination

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:26.690 align:middle line:84%
of using regular CGM was
this AI type of situation,

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:28.560 align:middle line:84%
where they'll build
more data into it.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.820 align:middle line:84%
So it will be able to help
people to predict how they're

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.300 align:middle line:84%
going to feel in certain
aspects of their wellness

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.330 align:middle line:90%
and lifestyle.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So tracking this,
first of all, helps

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:43.160 align:middle line:84%
you be very, very
honest with yourself

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.493 align:middle line:90%

>>VOLYNSKY: I didn't drink Coke.

00:38:57.445 --> 00:38:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: I mean, that's
not something I would do.

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:01.200 align:middle line:90%

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.000 align:middle line:90%

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes, cassava root.

>>REGINA: Cassava roots, that's
in paleo baking products.

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Well,
and that's the thing.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.750 align:middle line:90%

magnificent thing to have

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.040 align:middle line:84%

>>REGINA: That's
fascinating, yes.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And that could
also change from, like--

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and for women in a cycle,
it can change literally.

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:26.160 align:middle line:84%
But you will find staple
foods where you're like, OK,

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.950 align:middle line:84%
these things are
definitely making a mess.

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:29.870 align:middle line:84%

for me, like, awful.

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:30.980 align:middle line:90%
I cannot have bananas.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.450 align:middle line:90%
But some people have bananas--

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:33.658 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Doesn't do a thing.

00:39:33.658 --> 00:39:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Not a problem.

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:38.270 align:middle line:84%
I think one of my friends
was today on the--

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:41.030 align:middle line:84%
he has the "Broken
Brain" podcast, reporting

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:42.380 align:middle line:90%
how he ate some French fries.

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And within minutes, his
blood sugar was, like, 140.

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And he was just shocked
how fast that happened.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:50.328 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So it's a really
good, honest tool to find out,

00:39:50.328 --> 00:39:52.740 align:middle line:84%
A, what is good for
you food-wise by--

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:57.830 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] So you can
avoid some of those foods.

00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:00.380 align:middle line:84%
B, to keep you in
that very narrow zone.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:03.890 align:middle line:84%
You want to have your blood
sugar nice and stable.

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:07.340 align:middle line:84%
C, to actually help you find out
why you might not be sleeping.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:12.755 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people have
major blood sugar drops

00:40:12.755 --> 00:40:13.880 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the night.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.797 align:middle line:84%
And that will wake them
up, because their body

00:40:15.797 --> 00:40:17.320 align:middle line:90%
goes like, oh, panic.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.878 align:middle line:84%
We need blood
sugar to the brain.

00:40:19.878 --> 00:40:20.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we need to wake up.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.490 align:middle line:84%
We need to bring
the cortisol up.

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that, because
it's tracking you overnight.

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to have to
maybe do something before bed.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.640 align:middle line:90%
Maybe have a special snack.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And it will be different
for each person.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Some people do really
well with honey.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
a handful of nuts.

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So you start
experimenting and finding

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.850 align:middle line:84%
what provides you that
nice and stable blood

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:40.850 align:middle line:90%
sugar through the night.

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:42.767 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now if you
look at it, going back

00:40:42.767 --> 00:40:45.130 align:middle line:84%
to the basis of
your immune system,

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.693 align:middle line:84%
and how blood sugar is
affecting our immune system

00:40:47.693 --> 00:40:49.360 align:middle line:84%
in this time where
everybody's concerned

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.580 align:middle line:84%
about their immune system,
let's dovetail those.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So
glucose, obviously,

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.710 align:middle line:84%
is not just one factor
of metabolic health.

00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:59.950 align:middle line:90%
It's also insulin.

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So insulin and glucose,
you would think they'd

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.570 align:middle line:90%
go hand in hand together.

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:07.210 align:middle line:84%
But actually over
time, especially

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:09.640 align:middle line:84%
the more a person becomes
more insulin-resistant,

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.890 align:middle line:84%
the insulin goes up
and glucose goes down.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it becomes
a very problematic situation.

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:21.460 align:middle line:84%
When your adipose tissue,
when your, basically, fat,

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:26.710 align:middle line:84%
becomes engorged from constantly
having high insulin saying

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:28.838 align:middle line:84%
like, take in fat,
make more fat cells,

00:41:28.838 --> 00:41:31.255 align:middle line:84%
because that's basically what
insulin is telling the body.

00:41:31.255 --> 00:41:33.520 align:middle line:90%
It's anabolic.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Create either more fat
cells-- because there's

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.920 align:middle line:90%
two ways you can put on weight.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.670 align:middle line:84%
You can either be one
of those people that

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:42.550 align:middle line:84%
makes more fat cells,
or you can be a person

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:47.320 align:middle line:84%
that the body tells the fat
cells to just grow bigger,

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.390 align:middle line:90%
the same fat cell.

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And in some way, it's
actually metabolically

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:54.910 align:middle line:84%
almost a little bit better
to have a type of body

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:58.000 align:middle line:84%
where you put on more fat
cells instead of just, like--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So yeah, when you
have this bloated fat cell,

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:06.710 align:middle line:84%
it starts leaking fatty acids
and inflammatory agents.

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:07.510 align:middle line:90%
And when you have--

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Inflammatory agents.

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.833 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah, so when you
have a lot of inflammation

00:42:10.833 --> 00:42:13.610 align:middle line:84%
in the body, your immune system
becomes more dysregulated.

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Because again, it's
a energy drain.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.340 align:middle line:90%
It's an energy problem.

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Mitochondria also get sicker
when that happens as well.

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:22.480 align:middle line:90%
There is more oxidation.

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.510 align:middle line:84%
There is overburden
on the liver.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So there is less
ability to biotransform,

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:31.990 align:middle line:84%
less ability to make nutrients,
and take the toxins out

they pointed to was diabetes

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:06.670 align:middle line:90%
and blood sugar issues.

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Absolutely, that
is one of the big concerns

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:12.850 align:middle line:90%
for anybody in that risk group.

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's so important
to start managing that.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that is
not only through diet.

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:18.670 align:middle line:90%
It's through genetics.

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:19.980 align:middle line:84%
We're all wired a
little differently.

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:22.022 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: We always--
a little bit differently.

00:43:22.022 --> 00:43:24.130 align:middle line:84%
So as far as how do you
become insulin-resistant?

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: OK, so you
can go through a diet.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:31.450 align:middle line:84%
You basically eat a lot of sugar
and a lot of carbohydrates,

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:32.570 align:middle line:90%
and you don't use them.

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:34.030 align:middle line:90%
So that is a caloric model.

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's also an
endocrine model, where

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.160 align:middle line:90%
the body has the calories.

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:43.690 align:middle line:84%
But then it decides whether it's
going to be used for energy--

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:46.840 align:middle line:84%
back your muscles I
use the most glucose,

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.290 align:middle line:90%
or you can start storing it.

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:51.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is where the
endocrine model comes in.

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:53.350 align:middle line:84%
The caloric one says
calories in, calories out.

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:56.150 align:middle line:84%
But they intersect,
actually, together.

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:58.840 align:middle line:84%
So the way you become
insulin-resistant, first of,

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.360 align:middle line:84%
all aging, that
happens over time.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.130 align:middle line:84%
We become more
insulin-resistant.

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And especially for women,
that happens a little bit

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:08.110 align:middle line:84%
faster, too, when
our hormones change.

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:10.007 align:middle line:84%
There's more instance
of insulin resistance

00:44:10.007 --> 00:44:11.965 align:middle line:84%
when we go through
menopause and perimenopause,

00:44:11.965 --> 00:44:15.670 align:middle line:84%
and the blood sugar is
a huge factor in there.

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's called
hyperinsulinemia when you--

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:18.668 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's called--

00:44:18.668 --> 00:44:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Hyperinsulinemia,
when we just

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.380 align:middle line:84%
have huge amounts of insulin,
just because you're constantly

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:27.315 align:middle line:84%
stimulating it by eating a
diet, a sad diet or, say,

00:44:27.315 --> 00:44:30.130 align:middle line:84%
a diet that's high in
carbohydrates, and your body

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:33.130 align:middle line:84%
is not able to deal with
it, whether genetically,

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:35.380 align:middle line:84%
or you're just
overloading the system.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Then cortisol is another factor
that will affect your insulin

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.110 align:middle line:84%
resistance, too,
because they work

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:43.340 align:middle line:90%
in a-- issues and patterns.

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So cortisol is a
stress hormones.

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:48.275 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And it wants
the glucose in the system.

00:44:48.275 --> 00:44:49.075 align:middle line:90%
So it will--

00:44:49.075 --> 00:44:49.950 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:51.283 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It needs to access it.

00:44:51.283 --> 00:44:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So whenever
your cortisol is up,

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:55.043 align:middle line:90%
glucose goes up, too.

00:44:55.043 --> 00:44:55.960 align:middle line:90%
And if your cortisol--

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You need to
have the energy to run.

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.825 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:56.825 --> 00:44:57.658 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Exactly.

00:44:57.658 --> 00:44:59.620 align:middle line:84%
So if your cortisol is
completely constantly

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:04.600 align:middle line:84%
going up because your lions are
chasing you 24/7, guess what?

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.880 align:middle line:84%
You're going to become
insulin-resistant.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and the other aspect of this
is cortisol, hypoglycemia,

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:13.270 align:middle line:90%
inflammation.

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:15.550 align:middle line:90%
Inflammation is a huge one, too.

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:17.440 align:middle line:84%
You will become more
insulin-resistant

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.790 align:middle line:90%
when you're sick.

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Like, even if you're
just sick with the flu,

00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:23.668 align:middle line:84%
the body wants the
glucose for specific--

00:45:23.668 --> 00:45:25.210 align:middle line:84%
it will keep the
glucose in the blood

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:27.590 align:middle line:90%
for specific immune processes.

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:30.720 align:middle line:84%
But if you are
constantly inflamed,

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and you have autoimmune
dysregulation especially,

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.880 align:middle line:84%
in this immune system when
we don't have enough energy,

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.802 align:middle line:84%
it will dysregulate first
before it becomes weak.

00:45:41.802 --> 00:45:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
think we're having

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.130 align:middle line:90%
so many autoimmune issues.

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And dysregulation means
the immune system just

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:49.320 align:middle line:90%
can't differentiate.

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.995 align:middle line:84%
It's like an army
without a leader.

00:45:50.995 --> 00:45:52.620 align:middle line:84%
It just shots everything
inside itself,

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:54.960 align:middle line:90%
not self, food, not food.

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.110 align:middle line:84%
So that can create a lot
of inflammation as well.

00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Our lifestyles, in a lot
of ways, are inflammatory.

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:05.250 align:middle line:84%
The toxins, the pollution,
the air pollution right now

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:07.710 align:middle line:84%
that's going on
with the fires, that

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:10.020 align:middle line:84%
is huge amounts of
particulates that

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.490 align:middle line:90%
are really bad for our system.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:14.190 align:middle line:90%
And we're already stressed.

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:17.820 align:middle line:84%
We have already stressed
detox systems to start with.

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:19.900 align:middle line:84%
You can have inflammation,
of course, from mold.

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:23.190 align:middle line:84%
You can have inflammation
from heavy metals being lodged

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:24.580 align:middle line:90%
in the system from radiation.

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:28.200 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of aspects of
why pro-inflammatory states will

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.070 align:middle line:90%
increase.

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And inflammation is tightly
tied into insulin resistance.

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:36.570 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times, it's
not the food for people.

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:38.040 align:middle line:84%
It might not be
even the cortisol,

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.180 align:middle line:84%
but is just a highly
inflammatory state.

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Whether from autoimmunity
or from something

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:43.410 align:middle line:90%
that's creating that.

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:45.285 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now we
need to go to solutions.

00:46:45.285 --> 00:46:47.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.380 align:middle line:84%
We don't have that
much time left,

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.660 align:middle line:84%
so let's get to
the solutions here.

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:54.870 align:middle line:84%
We have to start regulating
our emotions for one.

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes,
starting regulating

00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:58.705 align:middle line:84%
our emotions is a big one,
if there is energy present.

00:46:58.705 --> 00:47:00.205 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If there's
energy present.

00:47:00.205 --> 00:47:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: If there
is no energy present,

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:08.280 align:middle line:84%
just go to sleep, go rest,
take a nap, you know, detach.

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:13.380 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is, finding
a way out of fear and out

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:18.090 align:middle line:84%
of anxiety is moving towards
seeking and play and enjoy.

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So this work actually
goes to Jaak Panksepp.

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:25.770 align:middle line:84%
He wrote "Affective
Neuroscience," an amazing body

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:28.290 align:middle line:84%
of work, where for
the first time,

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:31.360 align:middle line:84%
a scientist had considered
that animals have emotions.

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.535 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Before that, it
was like this is your reward,

00:47:34.535 --> 00:47:35.850 align:middle line:90%
and this is punishment.

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:37.890 align:middle line:90%
The cat doesn't feel angry.

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:40.090 align:middle line:84%
It was actually--
what is it, that

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:42.660 align:middle line:84%
got a Nobel Prize for
mapping the reward

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.055 align:middle line:90%
centers in the brain in a cat.

00:47:44.055 --> 00:47:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or you could
be a cat or dog owner,

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:47.263 align:middle line:90%
and you know they have emotions.

00:47:47.263 --> 00:47:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Exactly, but in the
science would, it was like, oh.

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
reasons why we went

00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:56.070 align:middle line:84%
that way, we were trained in a
psychology department, trying

00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:57.990 align:middle line:84%
to separate ourselves
from the animals,

00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:59.220 align:middle line:90%
and say, no, we're different.

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And let's like investigate that
part, how we are different.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.840 align:middle line:84%
We have this neural cortex
that has all these higher brain

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.640 align:middle line:90%
functions.

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.240 align:middle line:84%
So we've been really focusing
on trying to figure it out,

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:12.030 align:middle line:84%
forgetting that we
have primal systems

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:14.220 align:middle line:84%
that we share with
all the mammals.

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.920 align:middle line:84%
We share with, like, rats,
we share with monkeys,

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.320 align:middle line:90%
and we share with cats.

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And actually, Panksepp was
known for making rats laugh.

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:26.770 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:27.740 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.360 align:middle line:84%
He figured out that
rats can actually

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.430 align:middle line:90%
laugh when you play with them.

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So he identified
primary emotion systems.

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Not just emotions of
what you're feeling,

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:42.210 align:middle line:84%
but the systems in all of
us, which is fear/anxiety.

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Panic/sadness where you get
separated from the mother.

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:47.730 align:middle line:90%
That starts that.

00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:49.740 align:middle line:90%
Then there is anger.

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Then it is seeking, play,
and joy, which are positive.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And there was also lust, which
is more than just sexual, which

00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:01.410 align:middle line:84%
was hard for him to
quantify with humans,

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:03.540 align:middle line:84%
because we have a lot
of weirdness along that.

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.850 align:middle line:84%
So he chucked it
little bit you know.

00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:07.530 align:middle line:90%
He didn't really go into it.

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:09.810 align:middle line:84%
But he was looking at
those primary systems,

00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:13.570 align:middle line:90%
and seeking is there optimism.

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:18.240 align:middle line:84%
It's why any animal would go out
to look for things to survive.

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.400 align:middle line:90%
And we're no different.

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.450 align:middle line:84%
We are looking for
things to survive.

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So getting out of
a negative state,

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:26.850 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times it's
like, OK, how can

00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:30.808 align:middle line:84%
I go into a seeking
state and optimistic that

00:49:30.808 --> 00:49:32.100 align:middle line:90%
has a little bit more hormones.

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:33.808 align:middle line:84%
Like, we were talking
about it yesterday.

00:49:33.808 --> 00:49:36.950 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, I'm just looking up
a recipe that makes me happy.

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:39.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, like having
a personal work.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.850 align:middle line:84%
The other one is
having playtime.

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:43.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I always
refer my clients

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:47.280 align:middle line:84%
to the Healthy Brain Platter,
from Daniel Siegel's work

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.360 align:middle line:90%
which was for children.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:51.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's really actually
useful for adults,

00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:54.330 align:middle line:84%
where he says, like, you look
at how much time you have

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and how much time you
spent in focus activity.

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:00.540 align:middle line:84%
How much time you spend
resting, how much time

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:03.660 align:middle line:84%
you spend in meditation
and like going inwards.

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:06.510 align:middle line:84%
How much time you spend
playing and physical activity.

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Those are the things--

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:09.210 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm missing one there.

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:11.730 align:middle line:84%
But those are the things that
you're basically looking at.

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And when I get any of my
clients to look at that,

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:17.865 align:middle line:84%
play is usually-- oh, yeah
the other one is connection.

00:50:17.865 --> 00:50:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes, and the
connection and the play

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:26.870 align:middle line:84%
have gotten so
small in our life.

00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:29.870 align:middle line:84%
We're just so obsessed with
getting stuff done, even

00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:32.300 align:middle line:84%
for the kids, and getting
them to more school

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and getting them to do
athletics, and getting--

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have a
real bug about that.

00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: No, but that is--

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:39.617 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not letting
people just be and play.

00:50:39.617 --> 00:50:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: That's how we come
back to our innate selves--

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.758 align:middle line:90%
to our even animal selves.

00:50:45.758 --> 00:50:47.425 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That how
we recharge, refresh.

00:50:47.425 --> 00:50:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Exactly
this is part of-- like,

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:54.140 align:middle line:84%
you see puppies play and
cheetahs and things like this.

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:58.190 align:middle line:84%
This is part of our ways to
get out of negative states.

00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:59.270 align:middle line:90%
To have more play.

00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:01.760 align:middle line:90%
To have permission to play.

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:03.590 align:middle line:90%
To have permission to connect.

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:05.540 align:middle line:84%
To have permission
to go in, and know

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:08.420 align:middle line:90%
that this is nothing negative.

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:10.700 align:middle line:84%
It's only going to bring you
to a more positive state,

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.770 align:middle line:84%
and really looking at
your schedule, and seeing,

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:15.530 align:middle line:84%
how much time are you
actually allocating to this?

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So creating times
where are you're

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:20.030 align:middle line:84%
spending more time
with your loved ones.

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Endorphins-- we get
endorphins when we hug.

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.740 align:middle line:84%
We get endorphins
from connection.

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:27.770 align:middle line:84%
We get endorphins when we
are seeing loved ones--

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:29.235 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The whole
oxytocin thing.

00:51:29.235 --> 00:51:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Absolutely,
and we actually

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:32.810 align:middle line:90%
addicted to our own opiates.

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:35.995 align:middle line:84%
But they're being made
through connection.

00:51:35.995 --> 00:51:37.055 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:37.055 --> 00:51:39.355 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So it's an
extremely important system.

00:51:39.355 --> 00:51:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then you look
at the time we've been,

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:43.250 align:middle line:84%
where people have been
very isolated from one

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:44.060 align:middle line:90%
another socially.

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.685 align:middle line:84%
They are afraid for
their own survival.

00:51:45.685 --> 00:51:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Social
networks, I think

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:52.160 align:middle line:84%
there have been several
studies of what was the most

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.862 align:middle line:90%
important factor in longevity.

00:51:53.862 --> 00:51:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And they looked at a whole
bunch of different things.

00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was the amount
of connections,

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:02.810 align:middle line:84%
and amount of just
daily conversations

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:07.730 align:middle line:84%
that an older person
has, had more influence

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:13.833 align:middle line:84%
on their lifespan than your
medication, your disease,

00:52:13.833 --> 00:52:14.750 align:middle line:90%
or anything like this.

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:16.190 align:middle line:90%
Because we are social beings.

00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, the
diseases of isolation everyone's

00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:19.550 align:middle line:90%
talking about now is a big deal.

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And oxytocin
trumps everything.

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: I mean,
like this is--

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the best.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.560 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good hug.

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Exactly.

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:29.720 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the highest ways
to rewire the whole system,

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.250 align:middle line:90%
is to get more oxytocin.

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And there are people that
are making less oxytocin

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:35.270 align:middle line:90%
genetically.

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:37.190 align:middle line:90%
There's actually genetic snips.

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:39.590 align:middle line:84%
When I'm doing genetics, it
was like, well, this person

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:43.700 align:middle line:84%
might not be as compassionate
of a mother, or being able to--

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.970 align:middle line:84%
not always say that, but
the other way around.

00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:48.020 align:middle line:90%
You can always affirm it.

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.180 align:middle line:84%
But you can see that
sometimes, that's

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:51.830 align:middle line:90%
just not part of the equation.

00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:54.830 align:middle line:84%
But still, oxytocin
is something that

00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:57.470 align:middle line:84%
can bring us out of
the negative state,

00:52:57.470 --> 00:53:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and out of the state of
despair and depression,

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and rewrite some
of that history.

00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
mindfulness techniques.

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere we can step back
and be a third person,

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:10.910 align:middle line:84%
being able to watch
your emotions,

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:13.200 align:middle line:90%
and really unpack the fear.

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.900 align:middle line:90%
That's what I like to do.

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, OK what do we know
about the situation?

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:19.970 align:middle line:84%
List the facts, and
what do I actually

00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:22.120 align:middle line:90%
project on this situation?

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:24.620 align:middle line:84%
So like in this situation, where
it's what we've been dealt,

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:27.530 align:middle line:84%
OK, there's this
disease, this x.

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:32.458 align:middle line:84%
We've seen people have
this type of situation.

00:53:32.458 --> 00:53:33.500 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean for me?

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm not going to
be able to have a job.

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to be able--

00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:38.570 align:middle line:90%
I might get sick.

00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:42.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to be able to
go to a festival next year.

00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So that is more
projected and subjective.

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can really go, how much
value am I actually assigning

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:48.950 align:middle line:90%
to this?

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And is it worth it for me
to being completely blown

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:55.760 align:middle line:90%
over this and miserable?

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:58.640 align:middle line:84%
Or can I go back
into a present state.

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:02.510 align:middle line:84%
I always say this time now
is an exercise in presence.

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:05.780 align:middle line:84%
There is no time than ever
to be in the present day,

00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:07.280 align:middle line:84%
because you really
don't know what's

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.240 align:middle line:90%
going to happen next day.

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: You just have
to stay in the moment.

00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And of course, our
brain comes back

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:16.560 align:middle line:90%
with our neurological pathways.

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's an
amazing body of work

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:20.092 align:middle line:90%
by Joe Dispenza, which I know--

00:54:20.092 --> 00:54:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Joe Dispenza.

00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:21.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Who I love.

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everybody loves Joe.

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Of course.

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's our hero.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: But he is
awesome at laying this

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:28.790 align:middle line:84%
out how we project
this reality and create

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:29.770 align:middle line:90%
these negative states.

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:32.390 align:middle line:90%
And he's also given tools.

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:36.290 align:middle line:84%
He's got great meditation,
and an amazing ability

00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:39.740 align:middle line:84%
to just get to the point
and use the science.

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And he uses his amazing
ability to speak

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:44.780 align:middle line:84%
to help you rewire the
brain, to break the habit

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:45.870 align:middle line:90%
of doing those things.

00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And some of these things,
we carry for generations.

00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: My
grandmother was like that,

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:51.110 align:middle line:84%
and this is how it
was in our families.

00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:53.725 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, that anxiety's
passed on to your mom, to you.

00:54:53.725 --> 00:54:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes, so if you
have the metabolic energy

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.998 align:middle line:84%
to do any of this work,
you should be doing it.

00:54:57.998 --> 00:54:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hook up with Dr. Joe.

00:54:59.290 --> 00:55:00.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: The
other way is also--

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:05.330 align:middle line:84%
getting out of fight or
flight is in the moment,

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:07.040 align:middle line:84%
instead of meditations,
which can be,

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.260 align:middle line:84%
like, you have to sit down,
you have to put headphones on,

00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:10.802 align:middle line:84%
you have to do
breathing or whatever.

00:55:10.802 --> 00:55:13.610 align:middle line:90%
It is just to notice your jaw.

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:15.050 align:middle line:90%
How tight is your jaw?

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:15.878 align:middle line:90%
Can you relax it?

00:55:15.878 --> 00:55:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Not just the position
of your tongue.

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Is your tongue pressed against
the roof of your mouth?

00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:21.020 align:middle line:90%
Can you drop it?

00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:23.570 align:middle line:84%
If you can drop it, it
will tell your stomach

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:26.690 align:middle line:84%
to drop as well, because you
know that knot in the stomach?

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:29.157 align:middle line:84%
So this is, like, fight
or flight stimulation.

00:55:29.157 --> 00:55:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So if the stomach drops, there
is more blood flow coming

00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:32.360 align:middle line:90%
into the digestive system.

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.735 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So drop your tongue
off the roof of your mouth.

00:55:34.735 --> 00:55:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes,
and relax the jaw.

00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And it will help the
stomach drop as well,

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and more blood flow will
start coming in and say--

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People call those
mouth breathers sometimes.
