00:00:19.663 --> 00:00:22.080 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: The day of
the in-office doctor's visit

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.430 align:middle line:10%
is over for now.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.140 align:middle line:10%
So how do we navigate
when we can't

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.910 align:middle line:10%
see our doctor face to face?

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Donese Worden
is here to help

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.800 align:middle line:84%
us co-create a new kind of
relationship between health

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.250 align:middle line:84%
care professional and
patient, so we can co-create

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.320 align:middle line:90%
a new medical model together.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:90%
Donese, welcome.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Wow, has your
industry been altered.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE WORDEN:
Turned upside down.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:10%
I will say, for me, not
as much, because I've

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle line:10%
been doing virtual
medicine for a while now.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.420 align:middle line:90%
People that can't be patients--

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.100 align:middle line:84%
I can see them all
over the world.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:84%
They become clients so
that I can advise them.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And I've been doing this
telemedicine for a while now.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I was
already in place.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:90%
For most docs, not at all.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.769 align:middle line:90%
And some of them still aren't.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you say,
gosh, how can you do anything

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.940 align:middle line:84%
if you can't see the doctor
and they can't check you out?

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And the reality
is a lot of people

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.148 align:middle line:84%
are highly stressed
out and suffer anxiety

00:01:19.148 --> 00:01:20.940 align:middle line:84%
when they go in for a
doctor's appointment.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.523 align:middle line:84%
People do not like going to the
doctor's office, by and large.

00:01:23.523 --> 00:01:24.482 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:01:24.482 --> 00:01:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, that part,
at least, hasn't been removed.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.180 align:middle line:84%
But how does it work
between you and them?

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.750 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the new
tools available to you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.797 align:middle line:90%
to do remote telemedicine?

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be
here for a while, right?

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.463 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: It's going
to be here for a while.

00:01:40.463 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we may switch
mostly into that.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm wondering.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.557 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: For the
good or the bad.

00:01:44.557 --> 00:01:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But 92% of the patients and
the people that have been using

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.300 align:middle line:84%
telemedicine now during
this pandemic like it.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.070 align:middle line:84%
They say, I don't
have to travel.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.308 align:middle line:90%
It's less time.

00:01:54.308 --> 00:01:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to sit in
the doctor's office.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't get the
white coat syndrome.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can still
get a feel if you

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.620 align:middle line:84%
have a physician that's
willing to talk with you

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:90%
and listen to you online.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And as far as diagnosing,
yes, there's a few things.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.280 align:middle line:90%
I can't palpate.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.760 align:middle line:84%
I can't touch something,
but I can see most things.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.870 align:middle line:90%
Show me a mole.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.820 align:middle line:84%
We have technologies now
that can do remote EKGs.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:90%
I'll talk about some of those.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we're
going to talk about--

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: The apps.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --that in a minute.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Yeah, on the
wearables that are amazing.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.270 align:middle line:90%
And we can do most things.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.160 align:middle line:90%
We really can.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.925 align:middle line:90%
And most of us are enjoying it.

00:02:28.925 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, if you're
talking about HMOs,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.490 align:middle line:84%
for example, you're
only getting what?

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.032 align:middle line:84%
An average at Kaiser of seven
minutes with the doctor anyway.

00:02:35.032 --> 00:02:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: At best.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At best.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Is there any chance
that you might even

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.720 align:middle line:84%
get slightly better
care on some level?

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Or with HMOs, they would
just remain the same.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:90%
You get seven minutes online.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.632 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: That's probably
going to stay the same.

00:02:48.632 --> 00:02:50.445 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
is you might see--

00:02:50.445 --> 00:02:52.590 align:middle line:84%
I'll have patients come,
Regina, and they've

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.560 align:middle line:84%
seen 6 or 8 or 10
different specialists.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:84%
No one is talking
to anyone else.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.340 align:middle line:84%
This specialist--
your cardiologist

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.660 align:middle line:90%
is not looking at your liver.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And they're not talking
to the rheumatologist.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.650 align:middle line:90%
No one connects it anymore.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:84%
So trying to find the doctor
that can spend the time

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.570 align:middle line:90%
to connect those dots--

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.085 align:middle line:90%
that's where medicine is going.

00:03:11.085 --> 00:03:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to be within
the insurance model?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.280 align:middle line:90%
Probably not for a while.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.080 align:middle line:90%
It's the cash-pay--

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It'll
be out of pocket.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --model.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.130 align:middle line:90%
It is out of pocket.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
But in the long run, it
saves everyone money,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.180 align:middle line:90%
including the system.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Because you're really pulling
it together diagnostically

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.190 align:middle line:84%
and looking at a
patient, not just

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.415 align:middle line:84%
physically, but emotionally,
spiritually, mentally--

00:03:28.415 --> 00:03:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
that's what you do.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --and asking
these questions.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we have friends.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.370 align:middle line:90%
And I know of their--

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.620 align:middle line:90%
where they've been in trouble.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.120 align:middle line:90%
And they've come to you.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And I know of their
experience, because you

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:90%
look at them holistically.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:84%
They have nothing but praise
for the relationship that you've

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:44.732 align:middle line:90%
developed with them.

00:03:44.732 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk just for a minute.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.230 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm thinking, overhead.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.170 align:middle line:84%
What happens when the doctor's
offices close up shop?

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.852 align:middle line:84%
Now, the bummer is people lose
jobs, those people that are--

00:03:54.852 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in the office.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.042 align:middle line:90%
But this is part of our new--

00:03:59.042 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It is part of the--

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --future.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --new paradigm.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of primary cares have
already gone out of business.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.440 align:middle line:90%
And it looks like several--

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.380 align:middle line:84%
many more are going to
by the time this is over.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.910 align:middle line:90%
They've had to let staff go.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.490 align:middle line:84%
The overhead is huge in
medical-- our malpractice,

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:90%
our business insurance.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.760 align:middle line:84%
By the time you put
our expenses together,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.860 align:middle line:90%
we're not really making much.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And people think
that doctors do.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.810 align:middle line:84%
They really don't,
especially in primary care

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.190 align:middle line:90%
or internal medicine.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to shave
off some of the overhead.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.120 align:middle line:84%
But like you said,
some jobs will be lost.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.850 align:middle line:90%
But we're in trouble.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.978 align:middle line:90%
We already have a shortage.

00:04:34.978 --> 00:04:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to get worse
on primary care physicians.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, we'll start looking
to nurses and others

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.200 align:middle line:84%
to jump in for that
seven-minute visit.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's even scarier
without the medical training.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you think
that the industry of PAs

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.798 align:middle line:84%
is going to become a bigger
deal-- physician's assistants?

00:04:52.798 --> 00:04:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that that's
going to become more in demand

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.990 align:middle line:90%
with what's happening now?

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It already is.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Nurse practitioners--

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --and PAs
are stepping in.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:84%
The doctors are allowing them
to do more and more and more.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Many of them are very good
at what they do, especially

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.120 align:middle line:84%
within the box that you stay
in within traditional medicine.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.920 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And some of them sometimes
will listen a little bit more,

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:84%
spend a little more time
than the doctors do.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:84%
However, their
amount of training

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.060 align:middle line:90%
is far less than a physician.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:84%
I know of one person,
in particular,

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.920 align:middle line:84%
who chose to remain
a PA who's very

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
advanced in his
understanding of medicine.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.860 align:middle line:84%
So he works alongside a
doctor and trains the doctor

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:84%
in his methods of holistic
healing of the person.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:84%
But the reason he
did it is because--

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
talk about this.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.682 align:middle line:84%
He was limited by what
he could offer as an MD.

00:05:44.682 --> 00:05:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
that's why we think

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.140 align:middle line:84%
this might become something
that people start thinking of.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.520 align:middle line:90%
And how do you feel about that?

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Because you've done
your due diligence.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.830 align:middle line:90%
You're an MD.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.928 align:middle line:90%
You're a naturopath.

00:05:55.928 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Yeah, as a
naturopathic medical doctor,

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:58.803 align:middle line:90%
I sit in the middle.

00:05:58.803 --> 00:06:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm able to
do both, which is

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.310 align:middle line:84%
nice to be able to look at
the meds, either prescribe

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:90%
or hopefully take them off.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.000 align:middle line:84%
It's very rare
that we want to go

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.400 align:middle line:84%
there to prescribe and
to understand that.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.650 align:middle line:90%
That's a unique place to sit--

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --from a
physician's standpoint

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
look at all sides

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.600 align:middle line:84%
and present to a patient,
especially oncology patients

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.030 align:middle line:84%
when they call and they
think they have a mindset.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.830 align:middle line:90%
I want to come in.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.455 align:middle line:84%
I only want to do
alternative medicine,

00:06:25.455 --> 00:06:27.400 align:middle line:84%
or I only want to
do traditional.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's about keeping
that open mind,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.460 align:middle line:84%
educating that
patient in all of it

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.770 align:middle line:84%
so that they can really
make proper decisions.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do
you think that this

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.065 align:middle line:84%
is where medicine
might be going,

00:06:36.065 --> 00:06:38.290 align:middle line:84%
more and more people
becoming naturopaths?

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: I think the
demand will be there.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.508 align:middle line:84%
Because the public
is at the point.

00:06:42.508 --> 00:06:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Already moving
in that direction.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.258 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: They're already
moving the direction.

00:06:46.258 --> 00:06:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying, what can the
doctor know in seven minutes?

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:90%
He didn't ask me anything.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.342 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you go to a naturopath.

00:06:51.342 --> 00:06:53.830 align:middle line:84%
We're asking about your
spiritual belief system

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and what your bowel
movements look like--

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.733 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --from one
end to the other.

00:06:56.733 --> 00:06:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And it is we want
to know everything.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First
to seventh chakra.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's exactly right.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So you want to know what-- all
like the old family doctor who

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.560 align:middle line:90%
saw the whole family.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I have five generations in some
of my families that I look at.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:09.610 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.397 align:middle line:84%
Do I need to do the
genetics in them?

00:07:12.397 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, if I see something
going through that

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.147 align:middle line:90%
we haven't identified.

00:07:15.147 --> 00:07:17.240 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time,
I know what's coming.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.460 align:middle line:90%
And so we prevent it.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.262 align:middle line:90%
And that's beautiful medicine.

00:07:20.262 --> 00:07:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It really is.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.755 align:middle line:84%
So right now, that's not what
most people are experiencing.

00:07:23.755 --> 00:07:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: No.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right now,
if you want to go

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.660 align:middle line:84%
see your doctor because
something is wrong,

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.570 align:middle line:84%
you have to go to an urgent
care facility, I guess.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if someone is feeling
sick, where do you even go?

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well, that emergency
medicine is emergency medicine.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.530 align:middle line:90%
We need to see it as such.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.225 align:middle line:84%
It is life saving, life
threatening in that moment.

00:07:41.225 --> 00:07:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Anything else-- all
they're going to do

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.017 align:middle line:84%
is release you and say, go
back and see a specialist

00:07:45.017 --> 00:07:46.240 align:middle line:90%
or your primary care.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.630 align:middle line:90%
They're there to save your life.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.040 align:middle line:84%
They are not there for your
overall health and discovering

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.540 align:middle line:90%
what the root of the problem is.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Unless it's a heart
attack, we want to know.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:54.006 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:54.080 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Then you want
them to take care of it.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right?

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.240 align:middle line:84%
But that is not what
that is built for.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.010 align:middle line:90%
And the system is overloaded.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.300 align:middle line:90%
It's broken.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think most of the
people, most in the public--

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.220 align:middle line:90%
they know that.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.887 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to talk about some

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:10.020 align:middle line:84%
of the ways in which
it's broken in a moment.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
spend some time talking

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.400 align:middle line:84%
about what's happening in
the mental health sector.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Because this is tragic--

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.010 align:middle line:90%
what's going on now.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.380 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people are depressed.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.870 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people had
underlying conditions

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.700 align:middle line:84%
that have moved
beyond depression

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.690 align:middle line:84%
into other kinds of behavior,
be it paranoid, aggressive,

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:30.820 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about that.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.245 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you
just finished reading

00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:33.130 align:middle line:90%
a very interesting book--

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.309 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --on this subject
that's fueling your commitment

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:37.419 align:middle line:90%
to this even further.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:90%
But what I want to do first--

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.473 align:middle line:84%
let's get into some of the
toys, some of the tools--

00:08:41.473 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: The technologies--

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --that are now--

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --that we've got.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --available
so that if you've got

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.320 align:middle line:84%
someone sitting across from
you with health problems

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.340 align:middle line:90%
across the screen.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So we've got remote
ways of looking.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.370 align:middle line:84%
We can do radiology,
can send something off.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.380 align:middle line:84%
A radiologist in real time can
read a CAT scan or a PET scan.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.470 align:middle line:84%
I'll have to wait 10 days
to get a report, right?

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:90%
For dermatology, 3D pictures.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:84%
They can look at it and say
that looks like melanoma.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.370 align:middle line:84%
That is suspicious
so that now, we

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.330 align:middle line:84%
know we do need a visit with
that particular specialist.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:84%
So we've come very, very far,
just from the doctors' offices.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:84%
There's new
technology that looks

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:24.240 align:middle line:84%
like you can wear a device,
and it will deliver medicines

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.200 align:middle line:90%
to that melanoma.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Melanoma is very
painful to treat.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.640 align:middle line:84%
But with the new patches,
with the little needles

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and the medicines, it can
be delivered without pain.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.107 align:middle line:84%
So we've got some
exciting technologies

00:09:36.107 --> 00:09:38.565 align:middle line:84%
that are on their way and things
that we already are using.

00:09:38.565 --> 00:09:39.365 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:39.365 --> 00:09:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And the artificial intelligence
and what that's doing--

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.710 align:middle line:90%
is that "scary" or "not scary?"

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.710 align:middle line:84%
So for using it for the right
purposes, I really like it.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.390 align:middle line:84%
It can look at
pulmonary nodules.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.580 align:middle line:84%
It can look at a
radiology and see

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.835 align:middle line:90%
if they're pulmonary nodules--

00:09:51.835 --> 00:09:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very interesting.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --and other
things, that it's actually

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.397 align:middle line:84%
faster and smarter than doctors
are in reading some things.

00:09:59.397 --> 00:10:01.230 align:middle line:84%
So if we're using it
for the right purposes,

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm not against it.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do
you think about D

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our actual
functional levels of it,

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.490 align:middle line:84%
as gaining it from the sun
versus supplementation?

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well, the sun
helps us convert, right?

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.345 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's the thing.

00:10:15.345 --> 00:10:17.920 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't have
those base molecules going,

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.170 align:middle line:90%
it's hard for it to convert.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:90%
You need both.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've
got to have both.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And most people
are deficient in vitamin D

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.560 align:middle line:90%
that we test.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: I think
it's environmental.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Something is blocking it.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But what's going on?

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Vitamin
D is a hormone.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It's a hormone.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what's
going on, because--

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: We don't know.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --it's an epidemic?

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yeah, we don't know.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.067 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone
I know, doesn't

00:10:33.067 --> 00:10:35.610 align:middle line:84%
matter how healthy, comes back
with insufficient vitamin D.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Arizona-- people
that are in the sun--

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Golfers.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.080 align:middle line:90%
Vitamin D deficient.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.520 align:middle line:84%
That's not because they're
not getting enough sunshine.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sun.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Something
is blocking it,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.665 align:middle line:84%
and the science is
still not clear on that.

00:10:48.665 --> 00:10:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, meanwhile,
it's a cheap supplement.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It is.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.808 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the good thing
is anybody can afford it.

00:10:53.808 --> 00:10:56.160 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the government
should be giving it out

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.657 align:middle line:84%
through local
distribution centers.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: And one of the--

00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's
at the base of so many--

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: So right.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --diseases.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It is.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.290 align:middle line:84%
But vitamin D by itself can
be harmful in high doses.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:05.335 align:middle line:90%
Vitamin A, D, E, and K--

00:11:05.335 --> 00:11:07.960 align:middle line:84%
those are those lipid soluble we
got to be careful with, right?

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: They can
make you toxic.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.730 align:middle line:84%
But vitamin D with vitamin
K is their proper way

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:90%
to usually do it.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:84%
But again, you need to
ask the doctor if you

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.060 align:middle line:90%
have any cardiovascular issues.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.097 align:middle line:84%
But D and K together
are a better way

00:11:23.097 --> 00:11:24.180 align:middle line:90%
to do than just vitamin D.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, this has been very helpful
for people watching right now.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Good.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Donese, I want to
go into this other area a bit,

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
because this is something that
you're really impassioned by.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.937 align:middle line:84%
We're going to jump
around a little bit.

00:11:35.937 --> 00:11:37.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go to
mental health, OK?

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.702 align:middle line:90%
And we were talking off camera.

00:11:39.702 --> 00:11:41.160 align:middle line:84%
You're just finishing
up this book.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to try
to find the author--

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.120 align:middle line:90%
"Mad in America."

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Yes, I just
finished it yesterday,

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.662 align:middle line:90%
as a matter of fact.

00:11:48.662 --> 00:11:49.620 align:middle line:90%
Now, I know what I see.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Robert Whitaker.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Robert Whitaker.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.960 align:middle line:84%
It's older, but
it still applies.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.610 align:middle line:90%
100% still applies.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And he really got
bashed by this.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.440 align:middle line:84%
But what he did was
document the history

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.780 align:middle line:84%
like Travis Christofferson
with the history of cancer.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of cancer.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.302 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Right-- "Tripping
Over the Truth" book.

00:12:06.302 --> 00:12:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By the way, just
quick diversions here.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.840 align:middle line:90%
Whatever happened to Travis?

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.020 align:middle line:90%
Is he OK after writing?

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.270 align:middle line:90%
I did the interview with them.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.170 align:middle line:90%
I love his work.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: He's great.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.277 align:middle line:84%
He's still doing
a lot of writing.

00:12:15.277 --> 00:12:17.198 align:middle line:84%
He wrote another book
on something different

00:12:17.198 --> 00:12:18.240 align:middle line:90%
about the medical system.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.140 align:middle line:90%
And he's doing a lot of writing.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So Travis
is doing great.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.713 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to hear it.

00:12:21.713 --> 00:12:22.600 align:middle line:90%
I love the guy.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's go ahead.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So this is what I
have known, what I have seen.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.050 align:middle line:84%
I personally believe that
most of psychiatry-- most

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.520 align:middle line:90%
is pseudoscience.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.393 align:middle line:90%
And I've known it.

00:12:33.393 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:84%
I've looked at the studies
myself and thought,

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.190 align:middle line:84%
this is garbage, or this one's
decent, or this one is not

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and what I have seen
it doing to patients.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And I've wanted to dig my
teeth in deeper than I have.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And I've dug in
quite a bit already.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.300 align:middle line:84%
But that book gave
me the history,

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:55.410 align:middle line:84%
the horrible, torturous,
nauseating history

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
of what we have done with
mental illness in this country

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.030 align:middle line:90%
and what we are still doing.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.590 align:middle line:84%
We really haven't
progressed much.

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.340 align:middle line:84%
We're causing brain damage
now with medications

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and not helping anybody
really with what

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:84%
the pathology is, which we
really still don't understand.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.080 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
schizophrenia, bipolar.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Most people in America-- the
stats were 8.1% of people

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.340 align:middle line:90%
were anxious.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety is the number
one, more than depression.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.230 align:middle line:84%
More than anything
else, it's anxiety.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, the stats are 80%.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.600 align:middle line:84%
When physicians are
asking, 80% of people

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.270 align:middle line:84%
are experiencing
some form of anxiety.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And the families
are experiencing it.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.080 align:middle line:90%
The kids are experiencing it.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.778 align:middle line:84%
And my message is,
please, please, learn

00:13:37.778 --> 00:13:38.820 align:middle line:90%
how to take care of that.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Work with someone
who can help you.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Don't think that you
can do it by yourself.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:42.450 align:middle line:90%
But don't be--

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How about Sensate?

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:44.265 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --anxious.

00:13:44.265 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.285 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:45.285 --> 00:13:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Sensate app.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Maybe.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:47.850 align:middle line:90%
Try things.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Don't get into a
depression where

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.330 align:middle line:90%
you're at a suicidal state.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.530 align:middle line:90%
You need help.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.710 align:middle line:84%
However, I would
caution everyone

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.940 align:middle line:84%
to not just go and let's
take up the next pill,

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.520 align:middle line:90%
the next pharmaceutical.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.320 align:middle line:84%
That might help your
anxiety for a moment.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.430 align:middle line:90%
But now, you may be addicted.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're going to go through
a cycle of sleep problems.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.460 align:middle line:90%
Now, depression.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.627 align:middle line:90%
You're going to gain weight.

00:14:08.627 --> 00:14:13.010 align:middle line:84%
It's going to castrate you
in a sense with-- sexually.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:16.378 align:middle line:84%
There are many horrible side
effects to these medications.

00:14:16.378 --> 00:14:17.670 align:middle line:90%
And you better read the insert.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And you better know about
them before you do them.

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
don't treat, but I'm

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.910 align:middle line:84%
saying be aware and
don't think, I'm anxious,

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.890 align:middle line:90%
let me just start this for now.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.080 align:middle line:84%
You better understand
that once you start them,

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.690 align:middle line:84%
it's a very hard
row to come off.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell me, off the
top of your head, if you can,

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:38.303 align:middle line:90%
the top three.

00:14:38.303 --> 00:14:40.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try to get
an interview with him,

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.100 align:middle line:84%
but the top three
takeaways from that book

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.080 align:middle line:90%
that you were really--

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.260 align:middle line:90%
maybe that even shocked you.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, I knew a
lot of the older practices

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.860 align:middle line:84%
that were at the time
sanctioned by the AMA

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.960 align:middle line:84%
and the large institutions,
our hospitals in.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.420 align:middle line:84%
But it was the Rockefeller
Institute, honestly,

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.260 align:middle line:90%
that started--

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --saying
let's do pharmaceutical,

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:03.140 align:middle line:90%
let's look at this.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.047 align:middle line:84%
And that's when things, in
my opinion, and in others

00:15:06.047 --> 00:15:07.130 align:middle line:90%
started going really awry.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this started
decades and decades ago.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Oh, yeah.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It put us under even
people like Royal Raymond Rife.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Researchers
went down after that.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So we were
drowning people--

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.820 align:middle line:84%
literally drowning and
bringing them back,

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:90%
not just electroshock.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.270 align:middle line:84%
What about the
frontal lobotomies?

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.270 align:middle line:84%
We did it forever, knowing
that it didn't work, that we

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.380 align:middle line:90%
were doing brain damage.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Then they came out
with the medications.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And they figured out
how they were working.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Sure, it made them calm.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.260 align:middle line:90%
The staff was happy.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And their family
was happy, except--

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lithium?

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --the fact
that there was nothing.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.795 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's all
kinds of medications.

00:15:38.795 --> 00:15:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I mean, that
was a really common one.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: It was a common
one for some people.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.890 align:middle line:84%
In very, very, very low
doses, it might be helpful.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.410 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was they
give more and more and more.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.270 align:middle line:90%
They literally damage the brain.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:51.930 align:middle line:84%
They've lost their
personalities.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:52.760 align:middle line:90%
They're drooling.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.367 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they're not aggravating.

00:15:54.367 --> 00:15:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
yelling and screaming,

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.930 align:middle line:84%
but they are literally a walking
vegetable with no personality.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about just
the common stuff today

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:03.560 align:middle line:84%
where everybody does
the Prozac or whatnot?

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: They are not
without side effects.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:07.910 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And in time, I think
that we will look back

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.690 align:middle line:84%
like we're looking
back now and say,

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.197 align:middle line:90%
how could we have done that?

00:16:14.197 --> 00:16:16.280 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have done it
to prisoners in the jail.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.370 align:middle line:84%
But we were allowed
to do experiment

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:25.340 align:middle line:84%
on mentally challenged people,
literal experiments hurting

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:30.230 align:middle line:84%
them, severe pain, horrendous
trauma of creating fear

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:34.460 align:middle line:84%
on purpose, of thinking that
we're going to shock them out

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.840 align:middle line:90%
of a psychosis.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.920 align:middle line:90%
None of that worked.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're using drugs
to do the same thing.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not fixing anything.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.800 align:middle line:84%
There is no real brain
chemistry that we have super

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.530 align:middle line:84%
identified-- the dopamine
pathway and all that.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:49.550 align:middle line:90%
That's been disproven.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.310 align:middle line:84%
But every psychiatrist
that I have talked with

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.880 align:middle line:90%
are still stuck on that.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you've got to
take this medicine-- serotonin,

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:57.890 align:middle line:90%
dopamine.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:01.820 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the science
and you look at the research,

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.950 align:middle line:90%
it's not good.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.650 align:middle line:90%
That's the honest truth of it.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And we have new research
that's coming out

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.420 align:middle line:84%
that you have to look at
who funded it, Regina--

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.349 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my gosh.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:13.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I think I told you this.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:14.667 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --and
how it's designed.

00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:17.510 align:middle line:84%
You can take any study
and poke holes in it.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.540 align:middle line:84%
You can take it and design
it from the beginning

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.599 align:middle line:84%
to try to look at what you
want to happen at the end.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And the pharmaceutical
companies are masters at this.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And especially in
psychiatry, which

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.790 align:middle line:84%
is one of the biggest,
if not the biggest

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.265 align:middle line:84%
amount of money that they make
are on these psychiatric--

00:17:34.265 --> 00:17:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hey, I watch--

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --medications.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the
ads on television.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And so they can make
it look the way that they want.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.630 align:middle line:84%
But when you really look
at the research, when

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:84%
you look at how it was
designed, who designed it,

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.420 align:middle line:84%
what the outcome was
supposed to be or really is,

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.700 align:middle line:84%
it becomes very gray and
very "squishy," so to speak.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I may have mentioned
this on another show

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.700 align:middle line:90%
with you at one time.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.500 align:middle line:84%
But one of the biggest
shocks of my young,

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.740 align:middle line:84%
professional life as
a journalist was I had

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.440 align:middle line:84%
a whistle-blower from inside
a university that does a lot

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.784 align:middle line:90%
of medical research hand me--

00:18:10.784 --> 00:18:15.530 align:middle line:84%
it was just a spiral-bound
ledger of the research

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:20.690 align:middle line:84%
going on within the university
and who funded each project.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.730 align:middle line:90%
I thought, there is--

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.760 align:middle line:84%
what I came away with-- there's
virtually no pure research.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.787 align:middle line:90%
I was just shocked.

00:18:26.787 --> 00:18:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It's hard.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
university came after me

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.760 align:middle line:90%
when I reported it on the news.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.560 align:middle line:90%
And I only reported a sliver.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And they came after
the station, too.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.340 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
sue the station.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Sure, sure.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:38.540 align:middle line:90%
It's big business.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And to come out and especially
as a physician, a journalist,

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.430 align:middle line:84%
you have freedom of speech
that can protect you, somewhat.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.013 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not on a
television station.

00:18:46.013 --> 00:18:46.800 align:middle line:90%
They'll come after everybody.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Well, that's true.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.040 align:middle line:90%
They come after everybody.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.850 align:middle line:84%
But as a physician to
come out and officially

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:56.740 align:middle line:84%
challenge and call
it pseudo-science,

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.620 align:middle line:84%
you've got to have a hard shell
and ready to take the backlash.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Because the only groups
that really can fund really

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.707 align:middle line:84%
well-done research are
the pharmaceuticals.

00:19:07.707 --> 00:19:09.790 align:middle line:84%
But if you say, well, what
about the universities?

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:10.640 align:middle line:90%
What about the NIH?

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're supported
by the pharmaceuticals.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: It's very
difficult to find an--

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --academic
psychiatrist that is not

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:17.155 align:middle line:90%
on a board--

00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --or supported by
a pharmaceutical company.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:90%
It's just embedded.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So we are so screwed.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, in which countries of
the world that you're aware of

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.700 align:middle line:90%
is it pure?

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Is there a purer science in
the developed Western countries

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.610 align:middle line:90%
anywhere?

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.935 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: I think that I'm
not going to say science.

00:19:35.935 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say, let's
look at the outcomes.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:40.750 align:middle line:84%
If we look at
schizophrenia, for example,

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.630 align:middle line:84%
the third world countries that
don't medicate their patients

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.670 align:middle line:90%
have far better results.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.610 align:middle line:84%
They have less people having
their second psychotic breaks.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:49.790 align:middle line:90%
They let them go through it.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.590 align:middle line:90%
They support them.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.550 align:middle line:90%
They nurture them.

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.760 align:middle line:84%
We did that in this country
for a while in a couple

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.870 align:middle line:90%
of-- the Quakers did it--

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.302 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --and a couple.

00:19:57.302 --> 00:20:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And their stats to date are
still far better than ours are.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:02.200 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Somebody does something
uncomfortable.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And we go-- oh, we throw
them in the psych ward.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:07.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's medicate them.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.602 align:middle line:90%
Let's damage their brain.

00:20:09.602 --> 00:20:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Let's get them on this cycle.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just watch them go
in and out, and in and out,

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:13.510 align:middle line:90%
and in and out.

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.093 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
start right there.

00:20:15.093 --> 00:20:16.780 align:middle line:84%
So in the Quaker
society, for example,

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.810 align:middle line:84%
do they keep the people at home
with them and not isolate them?

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well, they
had their own little--

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:25.700 align:middle line:90%
I won't call them hospitals.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
They were centers
that were run, that

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.770 align:middle line:84%
were social support,
good food, good water

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.045 align:middle line:90%
and let people talk--

00:20:31.045 --> 00:20:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Company.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.247 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --let them go
through this psychosis

00:20:33.247 --> 00:20:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and talk and say, I think
that I am speaking to aliens

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.530 align:middle line:90%
at the moment, whatever it was.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, first of all,
that's pretty common in here.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.232 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: I know in this group.

00:20:41.232 --> 00:20:44.800 align:middle line:84%
I know everybody could
say, of course they were.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.850 align:middle line:84%
But whatever their
delusion could have been,

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.110 align:middle line:90%
nobody judged them.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Nobody tried to medicate
them, knock it out of them

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:90%
into this drooling mess, right?

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:56.170 align:middle line:90%
And they got better.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Their rates of
relapse were far lower

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.290 align:middle line:84%
and still are today,
compared to today.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.030 align:middle line:90%
We had a house.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.520 align:middle line:90%
It was a group of doctors.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And I got it in my
notes somewhere here.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:84%
But it is in that book
as well, that it was--

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.270 align:middle line:90%
and I was well aware of this.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.800 align:middle line:90%
And it was run by physicians.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.990 align:middle line:90%
But again, it was very few.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.910 align:middle line:84%
If any medications
were ever used,

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.800 align:middle line:90%
they let the body process.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Let the mind process through
this and learn how to do it.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:26.380 align:middle line:90%
So let's learn how to deal.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's learn how
to be more in tune

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.230 align:middle line:84%
with ourselves, with our mental
health, our spirituality,

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.370 align:middle line:90%
and our families.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:34.940 align:middle line:90%
This could be a good thing.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's--

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It's challenging us.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --the silver lining.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:38.470 align:middle line:90%
I see that as a silver lining.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Families are coming back
together out of necessity.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, families, as
this progresses

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.112 align:middle line:84%
and the financial
repercussions progress,

00:21:46.112 --> 00:21:48.570 align:middle line:84%
more families will be living
together multi-generationally.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I have seen
this coming for years

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.510 align:middle line:84%
and have looked at it as a
total blessing where we all

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.900 align:middle line:90%
have one another.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.560 align:middle line:90%
Take some of the burden off.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes.

>>REGINA: Not one person--

00:22:00.295 --> 00:22:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Multi-dimensional.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --has to be
going to the office,

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:06.070 align:middle line:84%
working 40 to 60 hours a
week, coming home, paying

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:09.460 align:middle line:84%
all of their bills, doing their
shopping, doing the cooking.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.552 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a single
mother or a single father,

00:22:11.552 --> 00:22:12.760 align:middle line:90%
taking care of the kids, too.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think it's a
beautiful opportunity for us

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.930 align:middle line:90%
to come together and help.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: And I do, too, Regina.

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:20.200 align:middle line:84%
But most people
don't like change.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that might help.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And this change
happened that quick.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:23.922 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I get that.

00:22:23.922 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:84%
But in the end,
that might help it.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Wake up.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Wake up.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wake up.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And it might help
with that extreme--

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --anxiety
and depression that--

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --so many

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:33.850 align:middle line:84%

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's exactly right.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --right now.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's exactly right.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that is
going to drive you buggy.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's going to cause
some severe depression--

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.365 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Some anxiety, and--

00:22:39.365 --> 00:22:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in some people.

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --depression,
and all that.

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:42.937 align:middle line:84%
But again, what is
important in your life?

00:22:42.937 --> 00:22:44.770 align:middle line:10%
And what can you do
about it in this moment?

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:45.570 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:46.960 align:middle line:10%
>>WORDEN: Learning
to prioritize.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually
about your health

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.410 align:middle line:90%
and your family's health.

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:52.390 align:middle line:90%
That should be your priority.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Because without
that, you can't--

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:54.206 align:middle line:90%


00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:55.373 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So, someone comes.

00:22:55.373 --> 00:22:56.080 align:middle line:90%
They're severely depressed.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.220 align:middle line:90%
They're picking up weight.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they've been even
involved in domestic violence,

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.340 align:middle line:90%
which is way on the increase--

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes, that's right.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --kids,
women, so forth.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.950 align:middle line:90%
Not good.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.907 align:middle line:84%
Divorce-- apparently,
can't even get on--

00:23:08.907 --> 00:23:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: You're spending time--

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --the docket.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.355 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --with
that person now.

00:23:11.355 --> 00:23:12.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean--

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Yeah, don't
like them after all.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.573 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --there
are so many divorces

00:23:15.573 --> 00:23:17.170 align:middle line:84%
that I know that in
certain counties,

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.462 align:middle line:84%
the system is so clogged,
you can't even get a divorce,

00:23:19.462 --> 00:23:21.070 align:middle line:90%
if you want to, for a while.

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.290 align:middle line:84%
You have to get on the
docket and wait your turn.

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.380 align:middle line:90%
And so this is really--

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.880 align:middle line:84%
it's forcing everyone to deal
with their stuff, how really--

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: To really look--

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --it's
going to come up.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --at your life.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.505 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you have
someone sitting in front

00:23:31.505 --> 00:23:33.655 align:middle line:90%
of you, they're depressed.

00:23:33.655 --> 00:23:35.020 align:middle line:90%
They've picked up some weight.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.550 align:middle line:90%
Now, they're more depressed.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And now, say,
they're on the verge

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.820 align:middle line:90%
of maybe losing their income.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.400 align:middle line:90%
How do you, in your position--

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they haven't
gone to their--

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.730 align:middle line:84%
whoever their guru,
whatever it is.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:46.780 align:middle line:90%
They've come to you.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.160 align:middle line:90%
How do you guide them?

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.385 align:middle line:90%
Where do you start?

00:23:49.385 --> 00:23:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: If they're
new to me, they're

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:54.340 align:middle line:84%
going to take that one and
half, two-hour time to fill out

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.540 align:middle line:84%
that form that tells me
everything that I need to know.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.610 align:middle line:90%
And then we will dig in.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.860 align:middle line:90%
My job is to prioritize.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.900 align:middle line:84%
What does that person
sitting in front of me

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.580 align:middle line:90%
need at this moment?

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.590 align:middle line:84%
What are the basic
changes that they

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.870 align:middle line:84%
can do that doesn't
cost a lot of money?

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Or if they have
expendable income,

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:11.930 align:middle line:90%
what are some unique tests?

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And maybe-- I know
we talked about that.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.000 align:middle line:90%
We might bring some of that--

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
going to bring those.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --today.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah-- is, how far
can we and do we

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:19.920 align:middle line:84%
need to go to get
that person better?

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.730 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, Regina,
it's just somebody

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:24.770 align:middle line:84%
knowing that they're
being listened to,

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.950 align:middle line:84%
that they're being heard
by someone that they trust

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.260 align:middle line:84%
that knows medical,
that they can talk

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:90%
to about their spirituality.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.010 align:middle line:84%
The patients that
come from Gaia--

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:37.768 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --they've seen
my interview with you,

00:24:37.768 --> 00:24:38.900 align:middle line:90%
the oncology patients.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.500 align:middle line:84%
My staff even goes, yay,
it's a Gaia patient calling.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't have
to try to talk to them

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:50.970 align:middle line:84%
or inch in to the importance
of spirituality and meditation,

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:52.460 align:middle line:90%
prayer, spending that time.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.590 align:middle line:84%
They already know
that importance.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:57.320 align:middle line:84%
So we get to speak
at a different level

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.740 align:middle line:90%
while I'm digging into--

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
underlying conditions.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --the
underlying conditions

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.800 align:middle line:90%
in the physical body, right?

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: But we can speak
in a different language.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.770 align:middle line:90%
And they are just so--

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.080 align:middle line:90%
I have two in a couple of days--

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.640 align:middle line:90%
stage IV terminal cancers.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.330 align:middle line:90%
And they are just hopeful.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:15.232 align:middle line:84%
They have been through
both of them-- traditional.

00:25:15.232 --> 00:25:16.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, I take that back.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:17.570 align:middle line:84%
One has been
through traditional.

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:19.628 align:middle line:84%
The other one hasn't even
seen an oncologist yet.

00:25:19.628 --> 00:25:21.170 align:middle line:84%
They want to talk
to me first, right?

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: But it
is their mindset.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: It's the
mindset of preparing.

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you had
a client, as I recall.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:33.200 align:middle line:84%
I think she was also a
naturopathic doctor, right?

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.730 align:middle line:90%
And she came to you.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:37.790 align:middle line:90%
And she had very clear beliefs.

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:38.623 align:middle line:90%
I am not doing this.

00:25:38.623 --> 00:25:39.423 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing this.

00:25:39.423 --> 00:25:40.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing this.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.470 align:middle line:84%
But she was relying
on you to guide her.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And you had an interesting
outcome with her.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: With that
one was breast cancer.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:47.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.918 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I will never do
anything that's traditional.

00:25:49.918 --> 00:25:51.210 align:middle line:90%
And then she asked for my help.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:52.970 align:middle line:90%
I said, I need to know more.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.500 align:middle line:90%
Give me some more diagnostics.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Do something so that I can
help guide you through this--

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:59.372 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --if you
made up your mind.

00:25:59.372 --> 00:26:02.190 align:middle line:84%
But please don't think
that you're stuck.

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:03.680 align:middle line:90%
Please be open.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.690 align:middle line:84%
When we find out
new information,

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.820 align:middle line:90%
it opens up new possibilities.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:08.745 align:middle line:90%
She was adamant.

00:26:08.745 --> 00:26:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, we did a little
bit more testing.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:13.250 align:middle line:84%
When she found out she's triple
negative and HER2 positive

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.960 align:middle line:90%
and all that, she had surgery.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.160 align:middle line:90%
And I was in support of it.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Because for her, she
knew what that meant.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:22.100 align:middle line:84%
I have other patients
that come in.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.248 align:middle line:90%
And they don't have a clue.

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:24.540 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to have a clue.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.820 align:middle line:90%
I have one right now--

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.250 align:middle line:90%
ovarian cancer five years out.

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.200 align:middle line:84%
She should have been
gone four years ago.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:84%
She still, to this date,
doesn't know or want to know.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.090 align:middle line:84%
But by the stats,
she should've been--

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She should be dead.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --gone.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
in her benefit.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.370 align:middle line:90%
It's you as a person.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:44.845 align:middle line:84%
Do you find comfort in knowing
all the science, the research?

00:26:44.845 --> 00:26:46.470 align:middle line:84%
If you do, I'm going
to give it to you.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:47.553 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to tell you.

00:26:47.553 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to help you
know what's good research.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:50.470 align:middle line:90%
And we'll go.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.510 align:middle line:84%
We'll dig down, so you feel
comfortable about your choices.

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Or are you the person that
says, I don't want to know.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I want to pick the
people that I trust

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.330 align:middle line:90%
and let you make my decisions.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:00.980 align:middle line:90%
You have to know yourself.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And as a physician,
we have to know

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.220 align:middle line:90%
who's sitting in front of us.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.677 align:middle line:84%
If I had told that
patient her statistics,

00:27:06.677 --> 00:27:09.260 align:middle line:84%
my belief system is she probably
would have already been gone.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.560 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't have a clue.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.372 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's amazing what the
mind will conjure both ways.

00:27:13.372 --> 00:27:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
the mind is amazing.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.075 align:middle line:90%
The being is amazing.

00:27:16.075 --> 00:27:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It's be open.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.705 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to choose, Regina.

00:27:18.705 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's the point.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.240 align:middle line:90%
It's diversity.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to choose
alternative medicine

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.130 align:middle line:90%
or traditional.

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Why aren't you open to both?

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the
best and the worst.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.830 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at the best of
both and your belief system.

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:33.713 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's choose
the course that

00:27:33.713 --> 00:27:34.880 align:middle line:90%
needs to go through with it.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.015 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:27:36.015 --> 00:27:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about
some of the tests

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.780 align:middle line:90%
we were going to get to.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you're doing virtual
medicine and you have a doctor

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.670 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, you can ask
for tests, first of all.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:46.065 align:middle line:90%
You can request tests.

00:27:46.065 --> 00:27:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Absolutely.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's
talk about the top test

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:54.050 align:middle line:84%
to request for the average Joe,
right now, or Jolene, whatever.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:54.926 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:54.926 --> 00:27:57.260 align:middle line:90%


00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: I think things that
are missed all the time--

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.090 align:middle line:90%
hemoglobin A1C.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.400 align:middle line:84%
That's a three-month
look at your blood sugar.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.690 align:middle line:90%
You may go in one day.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And your glucose
looks OK on that test,

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:09.170 align:middle line:90%
but it may be high on my book.

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.510 align:middle line:84%
But your traditional doctor
may not even mention it to you.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:14.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
three months, it

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.925 align:middle line:84%
tells you your risk
factor for diabetes.

00:28:15.925 --> 00:28:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's time to
say, you better

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.670 align:middle line:84%
start looking at what
you're eating, not eating.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's make some dietary changes.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:25.862 align:middle line:84%
Some of my patients-- it depends
on what they're coming in for.

00:28:25.862 --> 00:28:27.320 align:middle line:84%
It depends on their
family history.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.750 align:middle line:84%
But I will get basic
cancer markers--

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.240 align:middle line:90%
CA-125/CEA.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.103 align:middle line:84%
And I tell my patients,
I do not think

00:28:34.103 --> 00:28:36.770 align:middle line:84%
or have a reason to believe that
you have cancer at this moment.

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:39.720 align:middle line:84%
However, if I have
this right now

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and if you have a lump or a bump
show up a few years from now,

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.310 align:middle line:84%
instead of being told, well,
let's just watch it, wait,

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.380 align:middle line:90%
and see, I'm going to say no.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:49.850 align:middle line:90%
Let's rerun these numbers.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:52.020 align:middle line:84%
If these numbers have
jumped up quickly,

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.160 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to wait.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.460 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look and see
because things caught early

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.610 align:middle line:90%
or much easier than later.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:59.810 align:middle line:84%
High-sensitivity
C-reactor protein--

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:00.610 align:middle line:90%
CRP.

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:02.950 align:middle line:84%
That's how much inflammation
you have in your body.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And, Regina, you know almost
every chronic degenerative

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:07.250 align:middle line:90%
disease we have--

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:08.050 align:middle line:90%
you name it.

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.520 align:middle line:90%
It's based on inflammation.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Why are we not knowing
that in our patients?

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And if they're full of
inflammation, don't--

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:18.490 align:middle line:84%
going on to an anti-inflammatory
medication that

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:21.430 align:middle line:84%
has negative side
effects, but looking

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:24.250 align:middle line:84%
at what you're eating, what
you should not be eating,

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:25.840 align:middle line:84%
looking at the
diet and lifestyle.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And can we do things to
bring down that inflammation?

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.020 align:middle line:90%
Those are important.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And then there's specialty
tests that are interesting.

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:37.120 align:middle line:84%
We can look at your levels of
your vitamins, your minerals,

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.920 align:middle line:84%
your proteins in the
white blood cell.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Remember, that
your immune system.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.130 align:middle line:90%
We can run those tests and look.

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Are you actually
deficient in a nutrient.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying, here's a
bag of supplements, take it,

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.800 align:middle line:84%
and I hope you'll get
better-- bad medicine.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:53.950 align:middle line:84%
It's nice medicine in thought,
but it's not good medicine.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:55.270 align:middle line:90%
We can do genetics.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I have a new test
now that I've been

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.350 align:middle line:84%
using called MicroGen.
Regina, if you have

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:02.110 align:middle line:84%
an infection-- and a lot
of times, it's just there

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:06.550 align:middle line:84%
and low level and making
your immune system busy.

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.790 align:middle line:84%
It's missed because we
usually send out something.

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And when the lab finds one
pathology, let's say E. coli,

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.560 align:middle line:90%
they quit looking.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And there could
be co-infections.

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:18.700 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm doing
these different types

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.920 align:middle line:84%
of testing where they
test it multiple ways.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'll have patients come
back with six pathogens.

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And it allows me to know
the best treatments.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.520 align:middle line:84%
One treatment might get
to five or six of those,

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:34.700 align:middle line:84%
so it's precision medicine
and not missing things.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:35.500 align:middle line:90%
And we've got that.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.480 align:middle line:90%
We have the DUTCH hormone test.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not just looking at
your levels of hormones.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Looking at the pathways--
that's where the problems begin.

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:45.040 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
pathways we want to block,

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.690 align:middle line:84%
certain pathways
we want to open up.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.960 align:middle line:84%
We may not have to use hormones
to get somebody feeling better.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:53.620 align:middle line:84%
It's looking at these
precision, precise pathways.

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:54.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's exciting to me.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
part of medicine--

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: I love that.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --is cool.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:56.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It is.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That these things are
there where you can get that

00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.320 align:middle line:90%
deeper glimpse into your--

00:30:59.320 --> 00:30:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:00.670 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --your own
internal chemistry.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And we can look
into your microbiome.

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
wanted to go next.

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
the big one, right?

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.160 align:middle line:90%
So the microbiome testing--

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:14.080 align:middle line:84%
we can see, let's say, your
cloud, your amount of bugs.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.620 align:middle line:84%
We can see if you're high in
Bifidos or if you're-- we can

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:19.960 align:middle line:90%
look at your little cloud.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:23.230 align:middle line:84%
What we know now by the science
is, I can't take my cloud,

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.690 align:middle line:84%
do anything to change it
to make it look like yours.

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:28.540 align:middle line:90%


00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:31.330 align:middle line:84%
We can switch ours
around a little bit.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And "diet is the golden thing"
if we can make changes in diet.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's about diversity.

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:40.450 align:middle line:84%
We know the more bugs that we
have, the healthier we are.

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:43.810 align:middle line:84%
We also know that it's pretty
much set-- your fingerprint

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:45.160 align:middle line:90%
in childhood.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.200 align:middle line:84%
How you're born, if you
were a vaginal birth,

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.990 align:middle line:84%
if you were breastfed,
if you have siblings.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
biggest things that

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:54.190 align:middle line:84%
helps have more
diversity for children

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:57.455 align:middle line:84%
and to create our microbiome for
the rest of our life are pets.

00:31:57.455 --> 00:31:58.330 align:middle line:90%
They're a good thing.

00:31:58.330 --> 00:31:58.712 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:31:58.712 --> 00:31:59.094 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:59.094 --> 00:31:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Isn't
that interesting?

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So in adults,
what changes ours is

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:07.000 align:middle line:90%
recent medication, geography.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.280 align:middle line:84%
PPIs, the proton
pump inhibitors--

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.920 align:middle line:84%
those are horrible on
our microbiome, right?

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:16.480 align:middle line:84%
They change our individual
microbiome in a negative way.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.750 align:middle line:84%
But we can't go and say, OK,
let me make mine match yours.

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:21.280 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't exist yet.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Precision medicine,
one day, is going

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.510 align:middle line:84%
to be able to say, OK, we
know what your bugs are,

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.070 align:middle line:90%
which we can see now.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.000 align:middle line:90%
We know what they are.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And we know what we need
to do in this pathology.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.320 align:middle line:90%
But we don't have that yet.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And the microbiome is
different in different places

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.550 align:middle line:90%
in your body.

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:37.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's unique to everybody.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:39.760 align:middle line:90%
How do you study that?

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.080 align:middle line:90%
How do you study that?

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.570 align:middle line:84%
But it is an area of
exciting research.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:46.060 align:middle line:84%
I've been to Boston
and LA this past year.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And the pharmaceuticals
are all there.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Because they know if we
can change the biome--

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:54.520 align:middle line:84%
the brain-gut connection,
the brain-gut immune,

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.240 align:middle line:84%
brain-gut-immune-hormone, you're
changing a lot of pathways.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, they want to be there
to find a strain, a something

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.270 align:middle line:84%
that they can patent
and precision-- go in

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:05.290 align:middle line:90%
and make a change.

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: But for the rest
of us, it's I think that we--

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.840 align:middle line:84%
and that may be good
medicine at some point.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.990 align:middle line:90%
But what about the diversity?

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:16.330 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that we
know is this-- interesting.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:18.310 align:middle line:84%
If you take an antibiotic,
one antibiotic,

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:22.360 align:middle line:84%
your microbiome-- yours will be
back to normal in a few days.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.070 align:middle line:84%
If you take two
antibiotics, it's

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.052 align:middle line:90%
going to take a lot longer.

00:33:26.052 --> 00:33:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And it may still look
a little different.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.990 align:middle line:84%
If you take three or more,
it doesn't go back to normal.

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:34.150 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't go back.

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.260 align:middle line:90%
It's changed forever.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And so as we learn
these things and we

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:41.180 align:middle line:84%
learn to manipulate
the bugs in our body,

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:42.400 align:middle line:90%
I say, right now, diversity.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Take different
probiotics, eat different

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:47.470 align:middle line:84%
fermented foods,
diversity, diversity.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:48.670 align:middle line:90%
Get as much as we can.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, what
about people who

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:52.210 align:middle line:84%
have spent their lifetime
traveling where you've been

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:53.500 align:middle line:90%
exposed to every kind of bug?

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:54.690 align:middle line:90%
Is that normally beneficial?

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:56.500 align:middle line:90%
Or do you pick up bugs?

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Well, you'll pick up--

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Both.

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --pathogens.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pathogens.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:33:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:33:59.830 align:middle line:84%
So you're going
to pick those up.

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's where that
MicroGen test comes in.

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:04.750 align:middle line:84%
I can find things that
before I couldn't find.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Or if we did find it,
they'd say, oh, here it is.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.739 align:middle line:90%
This person has Salmonella.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:09.800 align:middle line:90%
And so, OK, great.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's treat that.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.580 align:middle line:84%
But now, it's like, well,
they have Salmonella.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:13.939 align:middle line:90%
And they have E coli.

00:34:13.939 --> 00:34:14.739 align:middle line:90%
And they've got--

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:14.949 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my friend--

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And they've
got they've a fungal--

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:16.592 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --Dengue fever.

00:34:16.592 --> 00:34:17.477 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:34:17.477 --> 00:34:18.310 align:middle line:90%
All of these things.

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.830 align:middle line:90%
Those we can--

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:19.305 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Trichinosis--

00:34:19.305 --> 00:34:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --see.

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.015 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --from their little
stall in the little street

00:34:22.015 --> 00:34:22.815 align:middle line:90%
fruit in Thailand.

00:34:22.815 --> 00:34:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: It's looking
at the broad spectrum of.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
decide how to treat it.

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:32.739 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that this
new company-- they were only

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:36.610 align:middle line:84%
in working with infectious
disease specialist

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:37.780 align:middle line:90%
in the major hospitals.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.489 align:middle line:84%
And they came to
me and said, do you

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:42.159 align:middle line:84%
think that we can start using
this in regular medicine?

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:46.389 align:middle line:84%
I said yes, I want to start
utilizing this in cases

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:47.620 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not getting better.

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.245 align:middle line:84%
And I can't understand
why they're not.

00:34:49.245 --> 00:34:51.909 align:middle line:84%
There's something there
that I haven't found.

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And when I told
them, I said, well,

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:56.179 align:middle line:84%
this is one that may
have a biofilm around it.

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:57.637 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
put them on enzymes

00:34:57.637 --> 00:35:00.850 align:middle line:84%
to break up that biofilm
so that the bug is not

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:02.558 align:middle line:90%
protected from the treatments.

00:35:02.558 --> 00:35:03.475 align:middle line:90%
And they got ecstatic.

00:35:03.475 --> 00:35:04.370 align:middle line:90%
They go, oh, my gosh.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:06.300 align:middle line:84%
The doctor knows
what a biofilm is.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.780 align:middle line:84%
They were in the
background telling

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:08.950 align:middle line:90%
all the other researchers.

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:12.160 align:middle line:84%
They know these things, but
doctors sometimes don't.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So Johns
Hopkins is actually

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.670 align:middle line:84%
now mapping the microbiome
with a biome of tumors?

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:19.905 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Mm-hmm.

00:35:19.905 --> 00:35:21.490 align:middle line:84%
So there's other
universities, too.

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:22.600 align:middle line:90%
So we know a cancerous tumor--

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.058 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's
that mean, though?

00:35:24.058 --> 00:35:26.830 align:middle line:84%
What's the potential to come
out of that besides more drugs?

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well, it has
its own microbiome.

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:31.220 align:middle line:90%
It's its own thing going.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so why
are they doing this?

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Why are they committing
that research--

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Because--

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --for that?

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:35.482 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --we know
that those tumors

00:35:35.482 --> 00:35:36.970 align:middle line:90%
can recruit immune cells.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And that immunotherapy-- when
we start understanding the tumor

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:46.130 align:middle line:84%
microbiome, we may be able
to manipulate that as well.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And that means helping
to shrink or kill

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:49.560 align:middle line:90%
that tumor with immunotherapy.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so--

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's why.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --this is a good term.

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It's a good thing.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now,
one other thing.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:54.970 align:middle line:90%
I read this.

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Is there's something
called a viral biome

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:02.830 align:middle line:90%
or looking at the viral load?

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well,
we have multiple--

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:06.640 align:middle line:84%
so the microbiome includes
bacteria, viruses--

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Viruses.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --bugs.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:09.580 align:middle line:90%
It's the whole shebang.

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.705 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is there a test
where you're just looking

00:36:11.705 --> 00:36:13.720 align:middle line:90%
at the viral load in the body?

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well,
those viruses are

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:17.980 align:middle line:84%
what I'm looking at in
that microbiome test.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:22.090 align:middle line:84%
We're looking for viruses and
fungal and bacterias, right?

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:23.710 align:middle line:90%
Can we see all of them?

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:24.770 align:middle line:90%
Maybe, maybe not.

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
viruses we have no idea.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.420 align:middle line:90%
We haven't even named them yet.

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.850 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that we do know
that are pathological that

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:32.170 align:middle line:90%
cause you to be sick--

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:33.850 align:middle line:90%
we're pretty good at those.

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so this
was encouraging to me.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.160 align:middle line:84%
I was reading an article
recently about an 8,000-person

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.080 align:middle line:84%
study that had been
done of healthy people,

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.600 align:middle line:84%
no seeming illness of any kind,
nothing certainly that had

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.060 align:middle line:90%
manifested, so healthy people.

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And among these healthy people,
they found that 42% of them

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:59.040 align:middle line:90%
had in their blood--

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:06.510 align:middle line:84%
HIV, herpes, hep C and
B, papilloma virus,

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.790 align:middle line:84%
but they're
functioning just fine.

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:10.860 align:middle line:84%
They'd been exposed to
these various things

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:13.800 align:middle line:84%
to significant levels in
a large portion of them

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.620 align:middle line:90%
to what was significant levels.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.790 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:17.940 align:middle line:90%
The body--

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yet.

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --seems-- yet.

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.680 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, truly,
isn't the body wired

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.043 align:middle line:90%
to create its T cells and--

00:37:24.043 --> 00:37:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: The immune--

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --to move through?

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --system medicine.

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:27.750 align:middle line:90%
It's miraculous.

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:28.620 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Some of these are overwhelming
to the immune system.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.630 align:middle line:90%
COVID is an example, right?

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Some people's immune system
is able to take care of that.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.190 align:middle line:84%
You don't even
have any symptoms.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:40.873 align:middle line:84%
Other people's are more
significantly affected, even

00:37:40.873 --> 00:37:41.790 align:middle line:90%
to the point of death.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:42.590 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So as we study the immune
system more to understand it,

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:47.440 align:middle line:90%
we'll have more information.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.700 align:middle line:84%
But the immune system
is our best medicine.

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:51.658 align:middle line:90%
It is our best fighter.

00:37:51.658 --> 00:37:52.458 align:middle line:90%
It's smarter.

00:37:52.458 --> 00:37:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was
encouraged hearing that.

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:55.377 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: The best medicine.

00:37:55.377 --> 00:37:57.090 align:middle line:84%
You're saying the
dosage you need

00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and the right amount
without a side effect.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
microbiome studies--

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.850 align:middle line:90%
that's why it's going on.

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:07.740 align:middle line:84%
We realized that when you
help the basic, innate immune

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.460 align:middle line:84%
system, our own immune system--
be able to fight better.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:12.570 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it goes.

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.210 align:middle line:84%
We all have all kinds of
things lurking around.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Our immune system
keeps it at bay.

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:19.470 align:middle line:84%
But we know some of those
viruses in the long run

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:20.670 align:middle line:90%
could cause a cancer.

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:21.780 align:middle line:90%
When does it happen?

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.400 align:middle line:84%
When the patient
is under stress.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.020 align:middle line:84%
They've had these
viruses for years

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.820 align:middle line:90%
and functioned just fine, right?

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.060 align:middle line:84%
But stress comes
along, which that

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.450 align:middle line:90%
decreases the immune system.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:32.250 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Now, we have cancer.

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And most cancer
patients will tell you

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:37.620 align:middle line:84%
that there was a stressful
event that happened

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.925 align:middle line:90%
before this cancer showed up.

00:38:40.925 --> 00:38:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
get back to what

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.670 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about
earlier, this mind-body-spirit

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:45.470 align:middle line:90%
connection.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's exactly right.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, when they say
stress is the greatest killer,

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't assume that to be a
bumper sticker or a slogan.

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.040 align:middle line:90%
This is absolutely true.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Because once you start turning
into an acidic environment

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:02.400 align:middle line:84%
upon feeling these
kinds of stress,

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.790 align:middle line:84%
once the stress hormones
start kicking in,

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.340 align:middle line:84%
once your cortisol
levels rise, you're

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:12.820 align:middle line:84%
really now kicking off the
beginning of chronic disease

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:13.620 align:middle line:90%
in your body.

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.037 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So now, everybody
stresses about being stressed.

00:39:16.037 --> 00:39:17.670 align:middle line:90%
There are studies--

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Dr. [INAUDIBLE] that
did studies on what

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:21.840 align:middle line:90%
stressed cancer patients.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.790 align:middle line:84%
When you found out you
just had a diagnosis,

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:25.418 align:middle line:84%
it was the self-help
books, the things

00:39:25.418 --> 00:39:27.960 align:middle line:84%
that you're supposed to be doing
and thinking and you're not.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.100 align:middle line:90%
It stressed them out even more.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.390 align:middle line:90%
You're going, I can't stress.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Or I'm going to get sick.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:34.350 align:middle line:90%
No, let's educate ourselves.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's empower ourselves.

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And let's enlighten
ourselves to say,

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:39.840 align:middle line:90%
we've got an amazing body here.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.550 align:middle line:90%
How can I support myself?

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:44.700 align:middle line:90%
And what am I doing right now?

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Eating the foods I shouldn't
be doing, not exercising, not

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:49.170 align:middle line:90%
sleeping well.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:51.780 align:middle line:84%
What are the things
that I am doing and not

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.090 align:middle line:84%
doing right now, that I can
change, that can help me,

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:55.620 align:middle line:90%
because my body is amazing?

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Honor your spirit,
your emotion to your body.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:57.930 align:middle line:90%

And I look at it in another
way, too, which is we all

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:05.710 align:middle line:90%
have an expiration date, Right?

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:06.960 align:middle line:90%
It's on the package somewhere.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you
have a few options.

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:12.510 align:middle line:84%
You can exit here
or maybe down here.

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:15.450 align:middle line:84%
But the point is it's going
to happen to every one of us,

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:17.312 align:middle line:84%
to be able to still see
the beauty in life--

Now is the time to take the
time to meditate, to exercise.

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:32.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's about diversity.

Diversify your exercise,
do different things,

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:37.500 align:middle line:84%
eat different foods,
different nutrients.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.823 align:middle line:84%
Different bad things, the
environmental toxins that are

00:40:40.823 --> 00:40:42.240 align:middle line:84%
there-- if you eat
the same food--

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:42.870 align:middle line:90%

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I just spoke for an
affiliate of Cedars-Sinai.

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:07.528 align:middle line:90%
And it was a two-hour lecture.

00:41:07.528 --> 00:41:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And they'll have it
on their website.

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:12.550 align:middle line:84%
But it was about the brain-gut
connection with the group.

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:13.860 align:middle line:90%
So they're very interested.

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:14.740 align:middle line:90%
They understand.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:15.540 align:middle line:90%
They know.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They know
they have to go there.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: They know,
but they're not

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.740 align:middle line:90%
quite sure what to do about it.

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:22.530 align:middle line:84%
But if we're talking about apps
and programs, look at Gaia.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Gaia is my go-to to
do my yoga every day.

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:28.830 align:middle line:84%
I go and I find a new one
with a beautiful background.

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:32.167 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting away
with Rodney Yee--

00:41:32.167 --> 00:41:33.000 align:middle line:90%

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:43.210 align:middle line:90%
with meditation and yoga.

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:44.085 align:middle line:90%
We've got help there.

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:51.690 align:middle line:84%
that we could be doing
instead of saying--

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:55.290 align:middle line:84%
waiting for a doctor or
the government to save us.

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:57.130 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to happen.

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:00.030 align:middle line:84%

just about out of time.

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:02.490 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to
mention, even when

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:05.700 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
these universities

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.660 align:middle line:84%
taking a great interest
in the microbiome

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:09.870 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, you still
can't help but wonder,

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:11.703 align:middle line:84%
but, yeah, what's in
it, a patent somewhere?

00:42:11.703 --> 00:42:12.503 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Sure.

So even so, I'm glad
there's mapping it.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.278 align:middle line:84%
It'd be nice if
they could map it

00:42:18.278 --> 00:42:20.820 align:middle line:84%

rather than making a profit,

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:21.620 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And I will
say a lot of researchers

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.780 align:middle line:90%
do have that and doctors.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.858 align:middle line:84%
They go into it to heal
people, but then they

00:42:26.858 --> 00:42:27.900 align:middle line:90%
get caught in the system.

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:29.050 align:middle line:90%
I need my grant money.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:29.850 align:middle line:90%
I need this.

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:30.930 align:middle line:90%
I have to function.

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I will lose my job
if I don't do this.

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:34.620 align:middle line:90%
The system is broken.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:35.910 align:middle line:90%
And the researchers know it.

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:37.950 align:middle line:84%
I have a research friend
that's supposed to--

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:40.900 align:middle line:84%
for one of the major
publication journals, right?

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Review research
that comes his way.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.220 align:middle line:10%
And he's a stickler.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.900 align:middle line:10%
So I asked him not too long ago.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.300 align:middle line:10%
I said, you've been doing this
now for about nine months.

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:51.360 align:middle line:84%
How many have you
actually let through you?

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.170 align:middle line:90%
Zero.

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:53.790 align:middle line:90%
Because [LAUGHS].

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:56.130 align:middle line:90%
And so we need to look at this.

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:57.510 align:middle line:90%
And not all research is bad.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And not all pharmaceuticals
and drugs are bad.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.080 align:middle line:10%
But many of them, in my opinion,
do not have the research

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:04.950 align:middle line:10%
that they need.

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:07.960 align:middle line:10%
Or we could have gone a
natural route instead.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so Gaia videos--

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --Gaia
yoga or whatever.

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pilates and so forth--

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:15.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in the morning.

00:43:15.375 --> 00:43:17.010 align:middle line:90%
OK, good, healthy food.

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Get out in the sun,
walk a little bit.

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:19.738 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:43:19.738 --> 00:43:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if you
really get in trouble,

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:23.970 align:middle line:84%
hopefully they have someone,
a nice naturopathic doctor

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:24.810 align:middle line:90%
like you.

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:25.765 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can say.

00:43:25.765 --> 00:43:26.565 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:43:26.565 --> 00:43:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Or to not
get in trouble--

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't
get in trouble to--

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --to start with.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --begin with.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:29.855 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:43:29.855 --> 00:43:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Prevent.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:30.720 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You bet.

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Donese.

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Thank you, Regina.

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:35.803 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's a lot
of information to contemplate.

00:43:35.803 --> 00:43:37.220 align:middle line:10%
If that wasn't
enough for you, you

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:38.800 align:middle line:10%
can go to my previous
conversations

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.560 align:middle line:10%
with Donese in
the Gaia archives.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.380 align:middle line:84%

Donese via her website
